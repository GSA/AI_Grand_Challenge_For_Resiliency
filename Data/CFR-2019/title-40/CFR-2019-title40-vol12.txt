      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                Rim ditch (cell) building technique means a gypsum dewatering stack construction technique that utilizes inner and outer dikes to direct gypsum slurry flow around the perimeter of the stack before directing the flow and allowing settling of finer materials into the settling compartment. For the purpose of this definition, the rim ditch (cell) building technique includes the compartment startup phase when gypsum is deposited directly into the settling compartment in preparation for ditch construction as well as the step-in or terminal phases when most solids must be directed to the settling compartment prior to stack closure. Decant return ditches are not rim ditches.
              
                Shutdown commences when feed materials cease to be added to an affected source and ends when the affected source is deactivated, regardless of whether feed material is present in the affected source.
              
                Startup commences when any feed material is first introduced into an affected source and ends when feed material is fully loaded into the affected source.

              (i) The mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the phosphate rock dryer or calciner, or
              (ii) The mass flow of product from the phosphate rock dryer or calciner.
              (2) Maintain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) If you monitor the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the phosphate rock dryer or calciner as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, maintain a daily record of phosphate rock feed by determining the total mass rate in metric tons/hour of phosphorus-bearing feed.
              (ii) If you monitor the mass flow of product from the phosphate rock dryer or calciner as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, maintain a daily record of product by determining the total mass rate in metric ton/hour of product.
              (c) For each purified phosphoric acid process line, you must comply with the monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CMS according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.608(c). The CMS must continuously measure and permanently record the stack gas exit temperature for each chiller stack.
              (2) Measure and record the concentration of methyl isobutyl ketone in each product acid stream and each raffinate stream once each day.
              (d) If you use a control device(s) to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you must install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) You must monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device that you use as specified in Table 3 to this subpart and establish the applicable limit or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, determine the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test.
              (ii) If you use an absorber or a wet electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you monitor pressure drop across the absorber or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, you must establish allowable ranges using the methodology specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
              (A) The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber and of the flow rate of the absorber liquid to each absorber in the process absorbing system, or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, is ±20 percent of the baseline average value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.

              (B) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you may establish allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber, or secondary voltage for an electrostatic precipitator, for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart using the procedures described in this paragraph. You must establish the allowable ranges based on the baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests, or the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph. You must conduct all performance tests using the methods specified in § 63.606. You must certify that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, you must determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges.
              (2) You must monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
              (3) You must comply with the calibration and quality control requirements that are applicable to the operating parameter(s) you monitor as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
              (4) If you use a non-regenerative adsorption system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (5) If you use a sorbent injection system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you use a fabric filter to collect the associated particulate matter, the system must meet the requirements for fabric filters specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (e) If you use a non-regenerative adsorption system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Determine the adsorber bed life (i.e., the expected life of the sorbent in the adsorption system) using the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) If the adsorber bed is expected (designed) to have a life of less than 2 years, determine the outlet concentration of mercury on a quarterly basis until breakthrough occurs for the first three adsorber bed change-outs. The adsorber bed life shall equal the average length of time between each of the three change-outs.
              (ii) If the adsorber bed is expected (designed) to have a life of 2 years or greater, determine the outlet concentration of mercury on a semi-annual basis until breakthrough occurs for the first two adsorber bed change-outs. The adsorber bed life must equal the average length of time between each of the two change-outs.
              (iii) If more than one adsorber is operated in parallel, or there are several identical operating lines controlled by adsorbers, you may determine the adsorber bed life by measuring the outlet concentration of mercury from one of the adsorbers or adsorber systems rather than determining the bed life for each adsorber.
              (iv) The adsorber or adsorber system you select for the adsorber bed life test must have the highest expected inlet gas mercury concentration and the highest operating rate of any adsorber in operation at the affected source. During the test to determine adsorber bed life, you must use the fuel that contains the highest level of mercury in any fuel-burning unit associated with the adsorption system being tested.
              (2) You must replace the sorbent in each adsorber on or before the end of the adsorbent bed life, calculated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
              (3) You must re-establish the adsorber bed life if the sorbent is replaced with a different brand or type, or if any process changes are made that would lead to a shorter bed lifetime.
              (f) Beginning August 19, 2016, if you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, then the fabric filter must be equipped with a bag leak detection system that is installed, calibrated, maintained, and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10) of this section.

              (1) Install a bag leak detection sensor(s) in a position(s) that will be representative of the relative or absolute particulate matter loadings for each exhaust stack, roof vent, or compartment (e.g., for a positive-pressure fabric filter) of the fabric filter.
              (2) Use a bag leak detection system certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic feet) or less.

              (3) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the system sensor.
              (4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will trigger an alarm when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located such that the alert is observed readily by plant operating personnel.
              (5) Install a bag leak detection system in each compartment or cell for positive-pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments or cells to a common stack. Install a bag leak detector downstream of the fabric filter if a negative-pressure or induced-air filter system is used. If multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
              (6) Calibration of the bag leak detection system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output level by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
              (7) After initial adjustment, you must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time except as established in your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.608(c). In no event may the sensitivity be increased more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete inspection of the fabric filter system that demonstrates that the system is in good operating condition.

              (8) Operate and maintain each fabric filter and bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, it is considered an operating parameter exceedance. Calculate the alarm time (i.e., time that the alarm sounds) as specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that corrective action is not required, the alarm duration is not counted in the alarm time calculation.
              (ii) If corrective action is required, each alarm time is counted as a minimum of 1 hour.
              (iii) If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.
              (9) If the alarm on a bag leak detection system is triggered, you must initiate procedures within 1 hour of an alarm to identify the cause of the alarm and then initiate corrective action, as specified in § 63.608(d)(2), no later than 48 hours after an alarm. Failure to take these actions within the prescribed time periods is considered a violation.
              (10) Retain records of any bag leak detection system alarm, including the date, time, duration, and the percent of the total operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds, with a brief explanation of the cause of the alarm, the corrective action taken, and the schedule and duration of the corrective action.
              (g) If you choose to directly monitor mercury emissions instead of using CPMS as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, then you must install and operate a mercury CEMS in accordance with Performance Specification 12A of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, or a sorbent trap-based integrated monitoring system in accordance with Performance Specification 12B of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. You must continuously monitor mercury emissions as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) The span value for any mercury CEMS must include the intended upper limit of the mercury concentration measurement range during normal operation, which may be exceeded during other short-term conditions lasting less than 24 consecutive operating hours. However, the span should be at least equivalent to approximately two times the emissions standard. You may round the span value to the nearest multiple of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of total mercury.

              (2) You must operate and maintain each mercury CEMS or sorbent trap-based integrated monitoring system according to the quality assurance requirements specified in Procedure 5 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter.
              (3) You must conduct relative accuracy testing of mercury monitoring systems, as specified in Performance Specification 12A, Performance Specification 12B, or Procedure 5 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, at normal operating conditions.
              (4) If you use a mercury CEMS, you must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the exhaust gas flow rate to the atmosphere according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.608(c).

              (c) For affected sources (as defined in § 63.600) that have not operated since the previous annual performance test was conducted and more than 1 year has passed since the previous performance test, you must conduct a performance test no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected source according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2).
              (d)(1) You must conduct the performance tests specified in this section at representative (normal) conditions for the process. Representative (normal) conditions means those conditions that:
              (i) Represent the range of combined process and control measure conditions under which the facility expects to operate (regardless of the frequency of the conditions); and
              (ii) Are likely to most challenge the emissions control measures of the facility with regard to meeting the applicable emission standards, but without creating an unsafe condition. Operations during startup, shutdown, and malfunction do not constitute representative (normal) operating conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test.
              (2) You must record the process information that is necessary to document the operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent representative (normal) conditions. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (e) In conducting all performance tests, you must use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 63.7(f).

              (g) You must demonstrate compliance with the applicable particulate matter standards specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Compute the emission rate (E) of particulate matter for each run using Equation AA-3:
              
                ER19AU15.002
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = Emission rate of particulate matter, kilogram/megagram (pound/ton) of phosphate rock feed.

              (2) Use Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 to determine the particulate matter concentration (C) and volumetric flow rate (Q) of the effluent gas. Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, the sampling time and sample volume for each run must be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dry standard cubic meter (30 dry standard cubic feet).
              (3) Use the CMS described in § 63.605(b) to determine the phosphate rock feed rate (P) for each run.
              (h) To demonstrate compliance with the particulate matter standards for phosphate rock calciners specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, you must use Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sampling volume for each test run must be at least 1.70 dry standard cubic meter.
              (i) To demonstrate compliance with the mercury emission standards for phosphate rock calciners specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, you must use Method 30B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8 to determine the mercury concentration, unless you use a CEMS to demonstrate compliance.

You must monitor and record operating parameter values for the fabric filter during the performance test. If the sorbent is replaced with a different brand or type of sorbent than was used during the performance test, you must conduct a new performance test.
              (l) If you use a mercury CEMS as specified in § 63.605(g), or paragraph (i) of this section, you must demonstrate initial compliance based on the first 30 operating days during which you operate the affected source using a CEMS. You must obtain hourly mercury concentration and stack gas volumetric flow rate data.
              (m) If you use a CMS, you must conduct a performance evaluation, as specified in § 63.8(e), in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan in § 63.608(c). For fabric filters, you must conduct a performance evaluation of the bag leak detection system consistent with the guidance provided in Office Of Air Quality Planning And Standards (OAQPS), Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). You must record the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to detecting changes in particulate matter emissions, range, averaging period, and alarm set points during the performance test.
            
            
              § 63.607
              Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.

              (a) You must comply with the notification requirements specified in § 63.9. During the most recent performance test, if you demonstrate compliance with the emission limit while operating your control device outside the previously established operating limit, you must establish a new operating limit based on that most recent performance test and notify the Administrator that the operating limit changed based on data collected during the most recent performance test. When a source is retested and the performance test results are submitted to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, § 63.7(g)(1), or § 63.10(d)(2), you must indicate whether the operating limit is based on the new performance test or the previously established limit. Upon establishment of a new operating limit, you must thereafter operate under the new operating limit. If the Administrator determines that you did not conduct the compliance test in accordance with the applicable requirements or that the operating limit established during the performance test does not correspond to representative (normal) conditions, you must conduct a new performance test and establish a new operating limit.
              (b) You must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10 as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) You must comply with the general recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10(b)(1).
              (2) As required by § 63.10(d), you must report the results of the initial and subsequent performance tests as part of the notification of compliance status required in § 63.9(h). You must verify in the performance test reports that the operating limits for each process have not changed or provide documentation of revised operating limits established according to § 63.605, as applicable. In the notification of compliance status, you must also:
              (i) Certify to the Administrator annually that you have complied with the evaporative cooling tower requirements specified in § 63.602(c).
              (ii) Submit analyses and supporting documentation demonstrating conformance with the Office Of Air Quality Planning And Standards (OAQPS), Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and specifications for bag leak detection systems as part of the notification of compliance status report.
              (iii) Submit the gypsum dewatering stack and cooling pond management plan specified in § 63.602(e).
              (iv) If you elect to demonstrate compliance by following the procedures in § 63.605(d)(1)(ii)(B), certify to the Administrator annually that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges.
              (v) Each time a gypsum dewatering stack is closed, certify to the Administrator within 90 days of closure, that the final cover of the closed gypsum dewatering stack is a drought resistant vegetative cover that includes a barrier soil layer that will sustain vegetation.
              (3) As required by § 63.10(e)(3), you must submit an excess emissions report for any exceedance of an emission limit, work practice standard, or operating parameter limit if the total duration of the exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period or greater. The report must contain the information specified in § 63.10 and paragraph (b)(4) of this section. When exceedances of an emission limit or operating parameter have not occurred, you must include such information in the report. You must submit the report semiannually and the report must be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of the calendar half. If you report exceedances, you must submit the excess emissions report quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency is approved as described in § 63.10(e)(3)(ii).
              (4) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record and report the following information for each failure:
              (i) The date, time and duration of the failure.

              § 63.608
              General requirements and applicability of general provisions of this part.
              (a) You must comply with the general provisions in subpart A of this part as specified in appendix A to this subpart.
              (b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination by the Administrator of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (c) For each CMS (including CEMS or CPMS) used to demonstrate compliance with any applicable emission limit or work practice, you must develop, and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request, a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. You must submit the site-specific monitoring plan, if requested by the Administrator, at least 60 days before the initial performance evaluation of the CMS. The requirements of this paragraph also apply if a petition is made to the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 63.8(f).
              (1) You must include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan.

              (i) Location of the CMS sampling probe or other interface. You must include a justification demonstrating that the sampling probe or other interface is at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device).
              (ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction systems.

              (iii) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations).
              (iv) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), (c)(4)(ii), and Table 4 to this subpart.
              (v) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d)(1) and (2) and Table 5 to this subpart.
              (vi) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
              (2) You must include a schedule for conducting initial and subsequent performance evaluations in the site-specific monitoring plan.

              (3) You must keep the site-specific monitoring plan on site for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If you revise the site-specific monitoring plan, you must keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the plan on site to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. You must include the program of corrective action required under § 63.8(d)(2) in the plan.

              (d) For each bag leak detection system installed to comply with the requirements specified in § 63.605(f), you must include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

              (1) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations), including how the alarm set point will be established.
              (2) A corrective action plan describing corrective actions to be taken and the timing of those actions when the bag leak detection alarm sounds. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the actions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
              (i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other conditions that may cause an increase in regulated material emissions.
              (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
              (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.
              (iv) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment.
              (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.
              (vi) Shutting down the process controlled by the fabric filter.
              (e) If you use blower design capacity to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section calculations showing how you determined the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber based on the blower's specifications (including any adjustments you made for pressure drop).
              (f) If you use a regression model to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section the calculations that were used to develop the regression model, including the calculations you use to convert amperage of the blower to brake horsepower. You must describe any constants included in the equations (e.g., efficiency, power factor), and describe how these constants were determined. If you want to change a constant in your calculation, then you must conduct a regression model verification to confirm the new value of the constant. In addition, the site-specific monitoring plan must be updated annually to reflect the data used in the annual regression model verification that is described in Table 3 to this subpart.

For existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, if your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, then the compliance date is August 19, 2018. In the interim, for existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, with an absorber designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, you must comply with one of the following: (i) The monitoring requirements in this Table 3 for absorbers designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; (ii) the applicable monitoring provisions included in a permit issued under 40 CFR part 70 to assure compliance with subpart AA; (iii) the applicable monitoring provisions of an Alternative Monitoring Plan approved pursuant to § 63.8(f); or (iv) install CPMS for pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber, and monitor pressure drop through the absorber.
                
                  c If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.608(e). The option to use blower design capacity is intended to establish the maximum possible gas flow through the absorber; and is available regardless of the location of the blower (influent or effluent), as long as the gas flow rate through the absorber can be established. Establish the minimum liquid-to-gas ratio operating limit by dividing the minimum liquid flow rate to the absorber (determined during a performance test) by the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber (determined using blower design capacity).
                

                  d If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.608(f). The regression model must be developed using direct measurements of gas flow rate, and design fan curves that correlate gas flow rate to static pressure (i.e., fan suction pressure) and brake horsepower of the blower. You must conduct an annual regression model verification using direct measurements of gas flow rate to ensure the correlation remains accurate. Direct measurements of gas flow rate used to develop or verify regression models may be collected during, or separately from, the annual performance testing that is required in § 63.606(b).

                Phosphate fertilizer production plant means any production plant that manufactures a granular phosphate fertilizer by reacting phosphoric acid with ammonia.
              
                Research and development facility means research or laboratory operations whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products, where the operations are under the close supervision of technically trained personnel, and where the facility is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce or other off-site distribution, except in a de minimis manner.
              
                Shutdown commences when feed materials cease to be added to an affected source and ends when the affected source is deactivated, regardless of whether feed material is present in the affected source.
              
                Startup commences when any feed material is first introduced into an affected source and ends when feed material is fully loaded into the affected source.
              
                Total fluorides means elemental fluorine and all fluoride compounds, including the HAP hydrogen fluoride, as measured by reference methods specified in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 13 A or B, or by equivalent or alternative methods approved by the Administrator pursuant to § 63.7(f).
            
            
              § 63.622
              Standards and compliance dates.

              (a) On and after the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, for each phosphate fertilizer process line (e.g., diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), granular triple superphosphate process line, and granular triple superphosphate storage building, you must comply with the emission limits as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. If a process line contains more than one emission point, you must sum the emissions from all emission points in a process line to determine compliance with the specified emission limits.

              (1) For each existing phosphate fertilizer process line (e.g., diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), granular triple superphosphate process line, and granular triple superphosphate storage building that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before December 27, 1996, you must comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart beginning on June 10, 2002.
              (2) For each new phosphate fertilizer process line (e.g., diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), granular triple superphosphate process line, and granular triple superphosphate storage building that commences construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996 and on or before August 19, 2015, you must comply with the emission limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart beginning on June 10, 1999 or at startup, whichever is later.
              (3) For each new phosphate fertilizer process line (e.g., diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), granular triple superphosphate process line, and granular triple superphosphate storage building that commences construction or reconstruction after August 19, 2015, you must comply with the emission limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart immediately upon startup.
              (b) Beginning on June 10, 2002, you must not ship fresh granular triple superphosphate from your existing granular triple superphosphate storage building that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before December 27, 1996. Beginning on June 10, 1999 or at startup, whichever is later, you must not ship fresh granular triple superphosphate from your new granular triple superphosphate storage building that commences construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996.

              (c) Beginning on August 19, 2015, you must not introduce into any evaporative cooling tower any liquid effluent from any absorber installed to control emissions from process equipment.
              (d) Beginning on August 19, 2015, during periods of startup and shutdown (as defined in § 63.621), you must comply with the work practice specified in this paragraph in lieu of the emission limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section. During periods of startup and shutdown, you must operate any control device(s) being used at the affected source, monitor the operating parameters specified in Table 3 of this subpart, and comply with the operating limits specified in Table 4 of this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.624
              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 63.625
              Operating and monitoring requirements.
              (a) For each phosphate fertilizer process line (e.g., diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), or granular triple superphosphate process line subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system (CMS) according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.628(c). The CMS must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range and must determine and permanently record the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing material fed to the process.
              (2) Maintain a daily record of equivalent P2O5 feed. Calculate the equivalent P2O5 feed by determining the total mass rate in metric ton/hour of phosphorus bearing feed using the procedures specified in § 63.626(f)(3).

              (b) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must maintain an accurate record of the mass of granular triple superphosphate in storage to permit the determination of the amount of equivalent P2O5 stored.
              (c) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (1) Maintain a daily record of total equivalent P2O5 stored by multiplying the percentage P2O5 content, as determined by § 63.626(f)(3)(ii), by the total mass of granular triple superphosphate stored as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (2) Develop for approval by the Administrator a site-specific methodology including sufficient recordkeeping for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with § 63.622(b).
              (d) If you use a control device(s) to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you must install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) You must monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device that you use as specified in Table 3 to this subpart and establish the applicable limit or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, determine the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test.
              (ii) If you use an absorber to comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you monitor pressure drop across the absorber, you must establish allowable ranges using the methodology specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.

              (A) The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber and of the flow rate of the absorber liquid to each absorber in the process absorbing system, or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, is ±20 percent of the baseline average value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.
              (B) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you may establish allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart using the procedures described in this paragraph. You must establish the allowable ranges based on the baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests or the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph. You must conduct all performance tests using the methods specified in § 63.626. You must certify that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, you must determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges.
              (2) You must monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
              (3) You must comply with the calibration and quality control requirements that are applicable to the operating parameter(s) you monitor as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
              (4) If you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, the system must meet the requirements for fabric filters specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (e) Beginning August 19, 2016, if you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, then the fabric filter must be equipped with a bag leak detection system that is installed, calibrated, maintained and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (10) of this section.

              (1) Install a bag leak detection sensor(s) in a position(s) that will be representative of the relative or absolute particulate matter loadings for each exhaust stack, roof vent, or compartment (e.g., for a positive-pressure fabric filter) of the fabric filter.
              (2) Use a bag leak detection system certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic feet) or less.
              (3) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the system sensor.
              (4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will trigger an alarm when an increase in relative particulate material emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located such that the alert is observed readily by plant operating personnel.
              (5) Install a bag leak detection system in each compartment or cell for positive-pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments or cells to a common stack. Install a bag leak detector downstream of the fabric filter if a negative-pressure or induced-air filter is used. If multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
              (6) Calibration of the bag leak detection system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output level by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
              (7) After initial adjustment, you must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time, except as established in your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.628(c). In no event may the sensitivity be increased more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete inspection of the fabric filter system that demonstrates that the system is in good operating condition.

              (8) Operate and maintain each fabric filter and bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, it is considered an operating parameter exceedance. Calculate the alarm time (i.e., time that the alarm sounds) as specified in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that corrective action is not required, the alarm duration is not counted in the alarm time calculation.
              (ii) If corrective action is required, each alarm time is counted as a minimum of 1 hour.

              (iii) If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time (i.e., time that the alarm sounds) is counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
              (9) If the alarm on a bag leak detection system is triggered, you must initiate procedures within 1 hour of an alarm to identify the cause of the alarm and then initiate corrective action, as specified in § 63.628(d)(2), no later than 48 hours after an alarm. Failure to take these actions within the prescribed time periods is considered a violation.
              (10) Retain records of any bag leak detection system alarm, including the date, time, duration, and the percent of the total operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm triggers, with a brief explanation of the cause of the alarm, the corrective action taken, and the schedule and duration of the corrective action.

              Performance tests and compliance provisions.
              (a) You must conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, within 180 days of the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.622.
              (b) After you conduct the initial performance test specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you must conduct a performance test once per calendar year.
              (c) For affected sources (as defined in § 63.620) that have not operated since the previous annual performance test was conducted and more than 1 year has passed since the previous performance test, you must conduct a performance test no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected source according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2).
              (d)(1) You must conduct the performance tests specified in this section at representative (normal) conditions for the process. Representative (normal) conditions means those conditions that:
              (i) Represent the range of combined process and control measure conditions under which the facility expects to operate (regardless of the frequency of the conditions); and
              (ii) Are likely to most challenge the emissions control measures of the facility with regard to meeting the applicable emission standards, but without creating an unsafe condition.
              (2) Operations during startup, shutdown, and malfunction do not constitute representative (normal) operating conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. You must record the process information that is necessary to document the operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent representative (normal) conditions. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (e) In conducting all performance tests, you must use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 63.7(f).
              (f) For each phosphate fertilizer process line (e.g., diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), and granular triple superphosphate process line, you must determine compliance with the applicable total fluorides standards specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.

              Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
              (a) You must comply with the notification requirements specified in § 63.9. During the most recent performance test, if you demonstrate compliance with the emission limit while operating your control device outside the previously established operating limit, you must establish a new operating limit based on that most recent performance test and notify the Administrator that the operating limit changed based on data collected during the most recent performance test. When a source is retested and the performance test results are submitted to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, § 63.7(g)(1), or § 63.10(d)(2), you must indicate whether the operating limit is based on the new performance test or the previously established limit. Upon establishment of a new operating limit, you must thereafter operate under the new operating limit. If the Administrator determines that you did not conduct the compliance test in accordance with the applicable requirements or that the operating limit established during the performance test does not correspond to representative (normal) conditions, you must conduct a new performance test and establish a new operating limit.
              (b) You must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10 as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) You must comply with the general recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10(b)(1); and
              (2) As required by § 63.10(d), you must report the results of the initial and subsequent performance tests as part of the notification of compliance status required in § 63.9(h). You must verify in the performance test reports that the operating limits for each process have not changed or provide documentation of revised operating limits established according to § 63.625, as applicable. In the notification of compliance status, you must also:
              (i) Certify to the Administrator that you have not shipped fresh granular triple superphosphate from an affected facility.

              (ii) Certify to the Administrator annually that you have complied with the evaporative cooling tower requirements specified in § 63.622(c).
              
              (iii) Submit analyses and supporting documentation demonstrating conformance with the Office Of Air Quality Planning And Standards (OAQPS), Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and specifications for bag leak detection systems as part of the notification of compliance status report.
              (iv) If you elect to demonstrate compliance by following the procedures in § 63.625(d)(1)(ii)(B), certify to the Administrator annually that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges.
              (3) As required by § 63.10(e)(1), you must submit an excess emissions report for any exceedance of an emission or operating parameter limit if the total duration of the exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period or greater. The report must contain the information specified in § 63.10 and paragraph (b)(4) of this section. When exceedances of an emission limit or operating parameter have not occurred, you must include such information in the report. You must submit the report semiannually and the report must be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of the calendar half. If exceedances are reported, you must submit the excess emissions report quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency is approved as described in § 63.10(e)(3).
              (4) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record and report the following information for each failure:
              (i) The date, time and duration of the failure.
              (ii) A list of the affected sources or equipment for which a failure occurred.
              (iii) An estimate of the volume of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit.
              (iv) A description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
              (v) A record of actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.628(b), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.
              (5) You must submit a summary report containing the information specified in § 63.10(e)(3)(vi). You must submit the summary report semiannually and the report must be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of the calendar half.
              (c) Your records must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review. You must keep each record for 5 years following the date of each recorded action. You must keep each record on site, or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that instantly provide access at the site, for at least 2 years after the date of each recorded action. You may keep the records off site for the remaining 3 years.
              (d) In computing averages to determine compliance with this subpart, you must exclude the monitoring data specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Periods of non-operation of the process unit;
              (2) Periods of no flow to a control device; and
              (3) Any monitoring data recorded during continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, instrument adjustments or checks to maintain precision and accuracy, calibration checks, and zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable), and high-level adjustments.
              (e) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, following the procedure specified in either paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.

              (1) For data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html), you must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (http://cdx.epa.gov/epa_home.asp). Performance test data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT. Alternatively, you may submit performance test data in an electronic file format consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site once the XML schema is available. If you claim that some of the performance test information being submitted is confidential business information (CBI), you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph.
              (2) For data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, you must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.

              (f) If you use a regression model to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section the calculations that were used to develop the regression model, including the calculations you use to convert amperage of the blower to brake horsepower. You must describe any constants included in the equations (e.g., efficiency, power factor), and describe how these constants were determined. If you want to change a constant in your calculation, then you must conduct a regression model verification to confirm the new value of the constant. In addition, the site-specific monitoring plan must be updated annually to reflect the data used in the annual regression model verification that is described in Table 3 to this subpart.

                  Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; orYour absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more, and you choose to monitor the liquid-to-gas ratio, rather than only the influent liquid flow, and you want the ability to lower liquid flow with changes in gas flow
                  
                  Liquid-to-gas ratio as determined by dividing the influent liquid flow rate by the gas flow rate through the absorber. The units of measure must be consistent with those used to calculate this ratio during the performance test
                  You must determine the gas flow rate through the absorber by:Measuring the gas flow rate at the absorber inlet or outlet;
                    Using the blower design capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop; c or

                  You may measure the pressure of the inlet gas using amperage on the blower if a correlation between pressure and amperage is established.
                
                
                  a To monitor an operating parameter that is not specified in this table (including process-specific techniques not specified in this table to determine gas flow rate through an absorber), you must request, on a site-specific basis, an alternative monitoring method under the provisions of § 63.8(f).
                
                  b For new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after August 19, 2015, the compliance date is immediately upon startup. For existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, if your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, then the compliance date is August 19, 2018. In the interim, for existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, with an absorber designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, you must comply with one of the following: (i) The monitoring requirements in this Table 3 for absorbers designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; (ii) the applicable monitoring provisions included in a permit issued under 40 CFR part 70 to assure compliance with subpart BB; (iii) the applicable monitoring provisions of an Alternative Monitoring Plan approved pursuant to § 63.8(f); or (iv) install CPMS for pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber, and monitor pressure drop through the absorber.
                
                  c If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.628(e). The option to use blower design capacity is intended to establish the maximum possible gas flow through the absorber; and is available regardless of the location of the blower (influent or effluent), as long as the gas flow rate through the absorber can be established. Establish the minimum liquid-to-gas ratio operating limit by dividing the minimum liquid flow rate to the absorber (determined during a performance test) by the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber (determined using blower design capacity).
                

                  d If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.628(f). The regression model must be developed using direct measurements of gas flow rate, and design fan curves that correlate gas flow rate to static pressure (i.e., fan suction pressure) and brake horsepower of the blower. You must conduct an annual regression model verification using direct measurements of gas flow rate to ensure the correlation remains accurate. Direct measurements of gas flow rate used to develop or verify regression models may be collected during, or separately from, the annual performance testing that is required in § 63.626(b).

              Applicability and designation of affected source.
              (a) This subpart applies to petroleum refining process units and to related emissions points that are specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section that are located at a plant site and that meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:
              (1) Are located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act; and
              (2) Emit or have equipment containing or contacting one or more of the hazardous air pollutants listed in table 1 of this subpart.
              (b)(1) If the predominant use of the flexible operation unit, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, is as a petroleum refining process unit, as defined in § 63.641, then the flexible operation unit shall be subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the predominant use of the flexible operation unit shall be the use representing the greatest annual operating time.
              (ii) If the flexible operation unit is used as a petroleum refining process unit and for another purpose equally based on operating time, then the predominant use of the flexible operation unit shall be the use that produces the greatest annual production on a mass basis.
              (2) The determination of applicability of this subpart to petroleum refining process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units shall be reported as specified in § 63.655(h)(6)(i).

              (c) For the purposes of this subpart, the affected source shall comprise all emissions points, in combination, listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section that are located at a single refinery plant site.
              (1) All miscellaneous process vents from petroleum refining process units meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section;
              (2) All storage vessels associated with petroleum refining process units meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section;
              (3) All wastewater streams and treatment operations associated with petroleum refining process units meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section;
              (4) All equipment leaks from petroleum refining process units meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section;
              (5) All gasoline loading racks classified under Standard Industrial Classification code 2911 meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section;
              (6) All marine vessel loading operations located at a petroleum refinery meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the applicability criteria of subpart Y, § 63.560;
              (7) All storage vessels and equipment leaks associated with a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station classified under Standard Industrial Classification code 2911 located within a contiguous area and under common control with a refinery meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section; and
              (8) All heat exchange systems, as defined in this subpart.
              (9) All releases associated with the decoking operations of a delayed coking unit, as defined in this subpart.
              (d) The affected source subject to this subpart does not include the emission points listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section.
              (1) Stormwater from segregated stormwater sewers;
              (2) Spills;
              (3) Any pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, or instrumentation system that is intended to operate in organic hazardous air pollutant service, as defined in § 63.641 of this subpart, for less than 300 hours during the calendar year;
              (4) Catalytic cracking unit and catalytic reformer catalyst regeneration vents, and sulfur plant vents; and
              (5) Emission points routed to a fuel gas system, as defined in § 63.641, provided that on and after January 30, 2019, any flares receiving gas from that fuel gas system are subject to § 63.670. No other testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting is required for refinery fuel gas systems or emission points routed to refinery fuel gas systems.

Decoking operations begin at the end of the cooling cycle when steam released from the coke drum is no longer discharged via the unit's blowdown system but instead is vented directly to the atmosphere. Decoking operations include atmospheric depressuring (venting), deheading, draining, and decoking (coke cutting).
              
                Delayed coking unit means a refinery process unit in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is produced in a series of closed, batch system reactors. A delayed coking unit includes, but is not limited to, all of the coke drums associated with a single fractionator; the fractionator, including the bottoms receiver and the overhead condenser; the coke drum cutting water and quench system, including the jet pump and coker quench water tank; and the coke drum blowdown recovery compressor system.
              
                Delayed coker vent means a miscellaneous process vent that contains uncondensed vapors from the delayed coking unit's blowdown system. Venting from the delayed coker vent is typically intermittent in nature, and occurs primarily during the cooling cycle of a delayed coking unit coke drum when vapor from the coke drums cannot be sent to the fractionator column for product recovery. The emissions from the decoking operations, which include direct atmospheric venting, deheading, draining, or decoking (coke cutting), are not considered to be delayed coker vents.
              
                Distillate receiver means overhead receivers, overhead accumulators, reflux drums, and condenser(s) including ejector-condenser(s) associated with a distillation unit.

                Equipment leak means emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants from a pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, or instrumentation system “in organic hazardous air pollutant service” as defined in this section. Vents from wastewater collection and conveyance systems (including, but not limited to wastewater drains, sewer vents, and sump drains), tank mixers, and sample valves on storage tanks are not equipment leaks.
              
                Flame zone means the portion of a combustion chamber of a boiler or process heater occupied by the flame envelope created by the primary fuel.
              
                Flare means a combustion device lacking an enclosed combustion chamber that uses an uncontrolled volume of ambient air to burn gases. For the purposes of this rule, the definition of flare includes, but is not necessarily limited to, air-assisted flares, steam-assisted flares and non-assisted flares.
              
                Flare purge gas means gas introduced between a flare header's water seal and the flare tip to prevent oxygen infiltration (backflow) into the flare tip or for other safety reasons. For a flare with no water seal, the function of flare purge gas is performed by flare sweep gas and, therefore, by definition, such a flare has no flare purge gas.
              
                Flare supplemental gas means all gas introduced to the flare to improve the heat content of combustion zone gas. Flare supplemental gas does not include assist air or assist steam.
              
                Flare sweep gas means, for a flare with a flare gas recovery system, the gas intentionally introduced into the flare header system to maintain a constant flow of gas through the flare header in order to prevent oxygen buildup in the flare header; flare sweep gas in these flares is introduced prior to and recovered by the flare gas recovery system. For a flare without a flare gas recovery system, flare sweep gas means the gas intentionally introduced into the flare header system to maintain a constant flow of gas through the flare header and out the flare tip in order to prevent oxygen buildup in the flare header and to prevent oxygen infiltration (backflow) into the flare tip.
              
                Flare vent gas means all gas found just prior to the flare tip. This gas includes all flare waste gas (i.e., gas from facility operations that is directed to a flare for the purpose of disposing of the gas), that portion of flare sweep gas that is not recovered, flare purge gas and flare supplemental gas, but does not include pilot gas, total steam or assist air.
              
                Flexible enclosure device means a seal made of an elastomeric fabric (or other material) which completely encloses a slotted guidepole or ladder and eliminates the vapor emission pathway from inside the storage vessel through the guidepole slots or ladder slots to the outside air.

                Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas is flowing, or whether the valve position would allow gas to flow, in a line.
              
                Force majeure event means a release of HAP, either directly to the atmosphere from a pressure relief device or discharged via a flare, that is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator to result from an event beyond the refinery owner or operator's control, such as natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; loss of a utility external to the refinery (e.g., external power curtailment), excluding power curtailment due to an interruptible service agreement; and fire or explosion originating at a near or adjoining facility outside of the refinery that impacts the refinery's ability to operate.
              
                Fuel gas system means the offsite and onsite piping and control system that gathers gaseous streams generated by refinery operations, may blend them with sources of gas, if available, and transports the blended gaseous fuel at suitable pressures for use as fuel in heaters, furnaces, boilers, incinerators, gas turbines, and other combustion devices located within or outside of the refinery. The fuel is piped directly to each individual combustion device, and the system typically operates at pressures over atmospheric. The gaseous streams can contain a mixture of methane, light hydrocarbons, hydrogen and other miscellaneous species.
              
                Gasoline means any petroleum distillate or petroleum distillate/alcohol blend having a Reid vapor pressure of 27.6 kilopascals or greater that is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines.

              (l) The owner or operator of an existing source may elect to control some of the emission points within the source to different levels than specified under §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable according to § 63.640(h), by using an emissions averaging compliance approach as long as the overall emissions for the source do not exceed the emission level specified in paragraph (g) of this section. The owner or operator using emissions averaging shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (1) Calculate emission debits and credits for those emission points involved in the emissions average according to the procedures specified in § 63.652; and

              (2) Comply with the requirements of §§ 63.648 and/or 63.649, 63.654, 63.652, 63.653, 63.655, 63.657, 63.658, 63.670 and 63.671, as applicable.
              
              (m) A State may restrict the owner or operator of an existing source to using only the procedures in paragraph (k) of this section to comply with the emission standard in paragraph (g) of this section. Such a restriction would preclude the source from using an emissions averaging compliance approach.
              (n) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

              § 63.643
              Miscellaneous process vent provisions.
              (a) The owner or operator of a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent as defined in § 63.641 shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section or, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section. The owner or operator of a miscellaneous process vent that meets the conditions in paragraph (c) of this section is only required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and § 63.655(g)(13) and (i)(12) for that vent.
              (1) Reduce emissions of organic HAP's using a flare. On and after January 30, 2019, the flare shall meet the requirements of § 63.670. Prior to January 30, 2019, the flare shall meet the requirements of § 63.11(b) of subpart A or the requirements of § 63.670.
              (2) Reduce emissions of organic HAP's, using a control device, by 98 weight-percent or to a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, on a dry basis, corrected to 3 percent oxygen, whichever is less stringent. Compliance can be determined by measuring either organic HAP's or TOC's using the procedures in § 63.645.
              (b) If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percentage of reduction requirement or concentration limit specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, then the vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device, or in a location such that the required percent reduction or concentration is achieved. Testing and monitoring is required only as specified in §§ 63.644(a) and 63.645 of this subpart.
              (c) An owner or operator may designate a process vent as a maintenance vent if the vent is only used as a result of startup, shutdown, maintenance, or inspection of equipment where equipment is emptied, depressurized, degassed or placed into service. The owner or operator does not need to designate a maintenance vent as a Group 1 or Group 2 miscellaneous process vent nor identify maintenance vents in a Notification of Compliance Status report. The owner or operator must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section for each maintenance vent according to the compliance dates specified in table 11 of this subpart, unless an extension is requested in accordance with the provisions in § 63.6(i).
              (1) Prior to venting to the atmosphere, process liquids are removed from the equipment as much as practical and the equipment is depressured to a control device meeting requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, a fuel gas system, or back to the process until one of the following conditions, as applicable, is met.
              (i) The vapor in the equipment served by the maintenance vent has a lower explosive limit (LEL) of less than 10 percent.

              (ii) If there is no ability to measure the LEL of the vapor in the equipment based on the design of the equipment, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or less. Upon opening the maintenance vent, active purging of the equipment cannot be used until the LEL of the vapors in the maintenance vent (or inside the equipment if the maintenance is a hatch or similar type of opening) is less than 10 percent.
              (iii) The equipment served by the maintenance vent contains less than 72 pounds of total volatile organic compounds (VOC).

              (iv) If the maintenance vent is associated with equipment containing pyrophoric catalyst (e.g., hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers) and a pure hydrogen supply is not available at the equipment at the time of the startup, shutdown, maintenance, or inspection activity, the LEL of the vapor in the equipment must be less than 20 percent, except for one event per year not to exceed 35 percent.
              (v) If, after applying best practices to isolate and purge equipment served by a maintenance vent, none of the applicable criterion in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) can be met prior to installing or removing a blind flange or similar equipment blind, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 2 psig or less, Active purging of the equipment may be used provided the equipment pressure at the location where purge gas is introduced remains at 2 psig or less.
              (2) Except for maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator must determine the LEL or, if applicable, equipment pressure using process instrumentation or portable measurement devices and follow procedures for calibration and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications.
              (3) For maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine mass of VOC in the equipment served by the maintenance vent based on the equipment size and contents after considering any contents drained or purged from the equipment. Equipment size may be determined from equipment design specifications. Equipment contents may be determined using process knowledge.
              (d) After February 1, 2016 and prior to the date of compliance with the maintenance vent provisions in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements in § 63.642(n) for each maintenance venting event and maintain records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in § 63.642(n) including, if appropriate, records of existing standard site procedures used to deinventory equipment for safety purposes.

              § 63.644
              Monitoring provisions for miscellaneous process vents.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each owner or operator of a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent that uses a combustion device to comply with the requirements in § 63.643(a) shall install the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, depending on the type of combustion device used. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment will monitor accurately and, except for CPMS installed for pilot flame monitoring, must meet the applicable minimum accuracy, calibration and quality control requirements specified in table 13 of this subpart.
              (1) Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
              (i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
              (ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.

              (2) Where a flare is used prior to January 30, 2019, a device (including but not limited to a thermocouple, an ultraviolet beam sensor, or an infrared sensor) capable of continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required, or the requirements of § 63.670 shall be met. Where a flare is used on and after January 30, 2019, the requirements of § 63.670 shall be met.
              (3) Any boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity greater than or equal to 44 megawatt or any boiler or process heater in which all vent streams are introduced into the flame zone is exempt from monitoring.
              (4) Any boiler or process heater less than 44 megawatts design heat capacity where the vent stream is not introduced into the flame zone is required to use a temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder.
              (b) An owner or operator of a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent may request approval to monitor parameters other than those listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in § 63.655(h). Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator:
              (1) Uses a control device other than an incinerator, boiler, process heater, or flare; or
              (2) Uses one of the control devices listed in paragraph (a) of this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) The owner or operator of a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent using a vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device used to comply with paragraph (a) of this section either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device that does not comply with the requirements in § 63.643(a) shall comply with either paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Use of the bypass at any time to divert a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent stream to the atmosphere or to a control device that does not comply with the requirements in § 63.643(a) is an emissions standards violation. Equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to § 63.648 are not subject to this paragraph (c).
              (1) Install, calibrate and maintain a flow indicator that determines whether a vent stream flow is present at least once every hour. A manual block valve equipped with a valve position indicator may be used in lieu of a flow indicator, as long as the valve position indicator is monitored continuously. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.655(h) and (i). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream away from the control device to the atmosphere; or
              (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and that the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line; or
              (3) Use a cap, blind flange, plug, or a second valve for an open-ended valve or line following the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b) and (c).
              (d) The owner or operator shall establish a range that ensures compliance with the emissions standard for each parameter monitored under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. In order to establish the range, the information required in § 63.655(f)(3) shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report.
              (e) Each owner or operator of a control device subject to the monitoring provisions of this section shall operate the control device in a manner consistent with the minimum and/or maximum operating parameter value or procedure required to be monitored under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Operation of the control device in a manner that constitutes a period of excess emissions, as defined in § 63.655(g)(6), or failure to perform procedures required by this section shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission standard of this subpart.

              (1) Methods 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. For vents smaller than 0.10 meter in diameter, sample at the center of the vent.
              (2) No traverse site selection method is needed for vents smaller than 0.10 meter in diameter.
              (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, an owner or operator seeking to demonstrate that a process vent TOC mass flow rate is less than 33 kilograms per day for an existing source or less than 6.8 kilograms per day for a new source in accordance with the Group 2 process vent definition of this subpart shall determine the TOC mass flow rate by the following procedures:
              (1) The sampling site shall be selected as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (2) The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, or 2F of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1 or Method 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, as appropriate.
              (3) Method 18 or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to measure concentration; alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part may be used. If Method 25A is used, and the TOC mass flow rate calculated from the Method 25A measurement is greater than or equal to 33 kilograms per day for an existing source or 6.8 kilograms per day for a new source, Method 18 may be used to determine any non-VOC hydrocarbons that may be deducted to calculate the TOC (minus non-VOC hydrocarbons) concentration and mass flow rate. The following procedures shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration:
              (i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.
              (ii) The TOC concentration (CTOC) is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for each run using the following equation if Method 18 is used:

                Qs = Vent stream flow rate, dry standard cubic meters per minute, at a temperature of 20 °C.
              
              

              (5) If Method 25A is used, the emission rate of TOC (ETOC) shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
              ETOC = K2CTOCMQs
              
              
              
                where:
                
                ETOC = Emission rate of TOC (minus methane and ethane) in the sample, kilograms per day.

              (h) The owner or operator of a Group 2 process vent shall recalculate the TOC emission rate for each process vent, as necessary, whenever process changes are made to determine whether the vent is in Group 1 or Group 2. Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in production capacity, production rate, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, process changes do not include: process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are within the range on which the original calculation was based.
              (1) The TOC emission rate shall be recalculated based on measurements of vent stream flow rate and TOC as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, as applicable, or on best engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in paragraph (g) of this section.

              (2) Where the recalculated TOC emission rate is greater than 33 kilograms per day for an existing source or greater than 6.8 kilograms per day for a new source, the owner or operator shall submit a report as specified in § 63.655(f), (g), or (h) and shall comply with the appropriate provisions in § 63.643 by the dates specified in § 63.640.
              (i) A compliance determination for visible emissions shall be conducted within 150 days of the compliance date using Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine visible emissions.

An example of a minor departure is monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every 6 weeks instead of monthly or quarterly). Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
              (c) In lieu of complying with the existing source provisions of paragraph (a) in this section, an owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements of §§ 63.161 through 63.169, 63.171, 63.172, 63.175, 63.176, 63.177, 63.179, and 63.180 except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (12) and (e) through (j) of this section.
              (1) The instrument readings that define a leak for light liquid pumps subject to § 63.163 of subpart H of this part and gas/vapor and light liquid valves subject to § 63.168 of subpart H of this part are specified in table 2 of this subpart.
              (2) In phase III of the valve standard, the owner or operator may monitor valves for leaks as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (i) If the owner or operator does not elect to monitor connectors, then the owner or operator shall monitor valves according to the frequency specified in table 8 of this subpart.
              (ii) If an owner or operator elects to monitor connectors according to the provisions of § 63.649, paragraphs (b), (c), or (d), then the owner or operator shall monitor valves at the frequencies specified in table 9 of this subpart.
              (3) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the first required monitoring period after the phase I compliance date specified in § 63.640(h) whether to calculate the percentage leaking valves on a process unit basis or on a sourcewide basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent calculations shall be on the same basis unless a permit change is made.
              (4) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the first monitoring period after the phase III compliance date specified in § 63.640(h) whether to monitor connectors according to the provisions in § 63.649, paragraphs (b), (c), or (d).

              (5) Connectors in gas/vapor service or light liquid service are subject to the requirements for connectors in heavy liquid service in § 63.169 of subpart H of this part (except for the agitator provisions). The leak definition for valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems subject to § 63.169 is 1,000 parts per million.
              (6) In phase III of the pump standard, except as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, owners or operators that achieve less than 10 percent of light liquid pumps leaking or three light liquid pumps leaking, whichever is greater, shall monitor light liquid pumps monthly.
              (7) Owners or operators that achieve less than 3 percent of light liquid pumps leaking or one light liquid pump leaking, whichever is greater, shall monitor light liquid pumps quarterly.
              (8) An owner or operator may make the election described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section at any time except that any election to change after the initial election shall be treated as a permit modification according to the terms of part 70 of this chapter.
              (9) When complying with the requirements of § 63.168(e)(3)(i), non-repairable valves shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking and non-repairable. Otherwise, a number of non-repairable valves up to a maximum of 1 percent per year of the total number of valves in organic HAP service up to a maximum of 3 percent may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking valves for subsequent monitoring periods. When the number of non-repairable valves exceeds 3 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP service, the number of non-repairable valves exceeding 3 percent of the total number shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves.
              (10) If in phase III of the valve standard any valve is designated as being leakless, the owner or operator has the option of following the provisions of 40 CFR 60.482-7(f). If an owner or operator chooses to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.482-7(f), the valve is exempt from the valve monitoring provisions of § 63.168 of subpart H of this part.
              (11) [Reserved]

              (f) Reciprocating pumps in light liquid service are exempt from §§ 63.163 and 60.482 if recasting the distance piece or reciprocating pump replacement is required.
              (g) Compressors in hydrogen service are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section if an owner or operator demonstrates that a compressor is in hydrogen service.
              (1) Each compressor is presumed not to be in hydrogen service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is in hydrogen service.
              (2) For a piece of equipment to be considered in hydrogen service, it must be determined that the percentage hydrogen content can be reasonably expected always to exceed 50 percent by volume.
              (i) For purposes of determining the percentage hydrogen content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a compressor, the owner or operator shall use either:
              (A) Procedures that conform to those specified in § 60.593(b)(2) of 40 part 60, subpart GGG.

Except as specified in paragraphs (j)(4) and (5) of this section, the owner or operator must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.
              (1) Operating requirements. Except during a pressure release, operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as detected by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
              (2) Pressure release requirements. For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service, the owner or operator must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section following a pressure release.
              (i) If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as specified in § 60.485(b) or § 63.180(c), as applicable, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP gas or vapor service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm.
              (ii) If the pressure relief device includes a rupture disk, either comply with the requirements in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section (not replacing the rupture disk) or install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release. The owner or operator must conduct instrument monitoring, as specified in § 60.485(b) or § 63.180(c), as applicable, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP gas or vapor service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm.
              (iii) If the pressure relief device consists only of a rupture disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release. The owner or operator may not initiate startup of the equipment served by the rupture disk until the rupture disc is replaced. The owner or operator must conduct instrument monitoring, as specified in § 60.485(b) or § 63.180(c), as applicable, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP gas or vapor service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm.
              (3) Pressure release management. Except as specified in paragraphs (j)(4) and (5) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service no later than January 30, 2019.

              (A) Identifying the pressure release;
              (B) Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and

              (C) Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the pressure relief device itself or may be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.
              
              (ii) The owner or operator must apply at least three redundant prevention measures to each affected pressure relief device and document these measures. Examples of prevention measures include:
              (A) Flow, temperature, liquid level and pressure indicators with deadman switches, monitors, or automatic actuators. Independent, non-duplicative systems within this category count as separate redundant prevention measures.
              (B) Documented routine inspection and maintenance programs and/or operator training (maintenance programs and operator training may count as only one redundant prevention measure).
              (C) Inherently safer designs or safety instrumentation systems.
              (D) Deluge systems.
              (E) Staged relief system where initial pressure relief device (with lower set release pressure) discharges to a flare or other closed vent system and control device.
              (iii) If any affected pressure relief device releases to atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, the owner or operator must perform root cause analysis and corrective action analysis according to the requirement in paragraph (j)(6) of this section and implement corrective actions according to the requirements in paragraph (j)(7) of this section. The owner or operator must also calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each pressure release event and report this quantity as required in § 63.655(g)(10)(iii). Calculations may be based on data from the pressure relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter monitoring data and process knowledge.

              (iv) The owner or operator shall determine the total number of release events occurred during the calendar year for each affected pressure relief device separately. The owner or operator shall also determine the total number of release events for each pressure relief device for which the root cause analysis concluded that the root cause was a force majeure event, as defined in this subpart.
              (v) Except for pressure relief devices described in paragraphs (j)(4) and (5) of this section, the following release events from an affected pressure relief device are a violation of the pressure release management work practice standards:
              (A) Any release event for which the root cause of the event was determined to be operator error or poor maintenance.
              (B) A second release event not including force majeure events from a single pressure relief device in a 3 calendar year period for the same root cause for the same equipment.
              (C) A third release event not including force majeure events from a single pressure relief device in a 3 calendar year period for any reason.
              (4) Pressure relief devices routed to a control device. (i) If all releases and potential leaks from a pressure relief device are routed through a closed vent system to a control device, back into the process or to the fuel gas system, the owner or operator is not required to comply with paragraph (j)(1), (2), or (3) (if applicable) of this section.
              (ii) If a pilot-operated pressure relief device is used and the primary release valve is routed through a closed vent system to a control device, back into the process or to the fuel gas system, the owner or operator is required to comply only with paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section for the pilot discharge vent and is not required to comply with paragraph (j)(3) of this section for the pilot-operated pressure relief device.
              (iii) If a balanced bellows pressure relief device is used and the primary release valve is routed through a closed vent system to a control device, back into the process or to the fuel gas system, the owner or operator is required to comply only with paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section for the bonnet vent and is not required to comply with paragraph (j)(3) of this section for the balanced bellows pressure relief device.

              (iv) Both the closed vent system and control device (if applicable) referenced in paragraphs (j)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section must meet the requirements of § 63.644. When complying with this paragraph (j)(4), all references to “Group 1 miscellaneous process vent” in § 63.644 mean “pressure relief device.”
              (v) If a pressure relief device complying with this paragraph (j)(4) is routed to the fuel gas system, then on and after January 30, 2019, any flares receiving gas from that fuel gas system must be in compliance with § 63.670.

Special circumstances affecting the number of root cause analyses and/or corrective action analyses are provided in paragraphs (j)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single emergency event that causes two or more pressure relief devices installed on the same equipment to release.
              (ii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single emergency event that causes two or more pressure relief devices to release, regardless of the equipment served, if the root cause is reasonably expected to be a force majeure event, as defined in this subpart.
              (iii) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, if more than one pressure relief device has a release during the same time period, an initial root cause analysis shall be conducted separately for each pressure relief device that had a release. If the initial root cause analysis indicates that the release events have the same root cause(s), the initially separate root cause analyses may be recorded as a single root cause analysis and a single corrective action analysis may be conducted.
              (7) Corrective action implementation. Each owner or operator required to conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis as specified in paragraphs (j)(3)(iii) and (j)(6) of this section shall implement the corrective action(s) identified in the corrective action analysis in accordance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (j)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) All corrective action(s) must be implemented within 45 days of the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required or as soon thereafter as practicable. If an owner or operator concludes that no corrective action should be implemented, the owner or operator shall record and explain the basis for that conclusion no later than 45 days following the event.
              (ii) For corrective actions that cannot be fully implemented within 45 days following the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required, the owner or operator shall develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable.
              (iii) No later than 45 days following the event for which a root cause and corrective action analyses were required, the owner or operator shall record the corrective action(s) completed to date, and, for action(s) not already completed, a schedule for implementation, including proposed commencement and completion dates.

              § 63.649
              Alternative means of emission limitation: Connectors in gas/vapor service and light liquid service.
              (a) If an owner or operator elects to monitor valves according to the provisions of § 63.648(c)(2)(ii), the owner or operator shall implement one of the connector monitoring programs specified in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
              (b) Random 200 connector alternative. The owner or operator shall implement a random sampling program for accessible connectors of 2.0 inches nominal diameter or greater. The program does not apply to inaccessible or unsafe-to-monitor connectors, as defined in § 63.174 of subpart H. The sampling program shall be implemented source-wide.
              (1) Within the first 12 months after the phase III compliance date specified in § 63.640(h), a sample of 200 connectors shall be randomly selected and monitored using Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (2) The instrument reading that defines a leak is 1,000 parts per million.
              (3) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.
              (4) If a leak is detected, the connector shall be monitored for leaks within the first 3 months after its repair.
              (5) After conducting the initial survey required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent monitoring of connectors at the frequencies specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(iv) of this section.
              (i) If the percentage leaking connectors is 2.0 percent or greater, the owner or operator shall survey a random sample of 200 connectors once every 6 months.
              (ii) If the percentage leaking connectors is 1.0 percent or greater but less than 2.0 percent, the owner or operator shall survey a random sample of 200 connectors once per year.
              (iii) If the percentage leaking connectors is 0.5 percent or greater but less than 1.0 percent, the owner or operator shall survey a random sample of 200 connectors once every 2 years.
              (iv) If the percentage leaking connectors is less than 0.5 percent, the owner or operator shall survey a random sample of 200 connectors once every 4 years.
              (6) Physical tagging of the connectors to indicate that they are subject to the monitoring provisions is not required. Connectors may be identified by the area or length of pipe and need not be individually identified.
              (c) Connector inspection alternative. The owner or operator shall implement a program to monitor all accessible connectors in gas/vapor service that are 2.0 inches (nominal diameter) or greater and inspect all accessible connectors in light liquid service that are 2 inches (nominal diameter) or greater as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section. The program does not apply to inaccessible or unsafe-to-monitor connectors.
              (1) Within 12 months after the phase III compliance date specified in § 63.640(h), all connectors in gas/vapor service shall be monitored using Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60 appendix A. The instrument reading that defines a leak is 1,000 parts per million.
              (2) All connectors in light liquid service shall be inspected for leaks. A leak is detected if liquids are observed to be dripping at a rate greater than three drops per minute.
              (3) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.
              (4) If a leak is detected, connectors in gas/vapor service shall be monitored for leaks within the first 3 months after repair. Connectors in light liquid service shall be inspected for indications of leaks within the first 3 months after repair. A leak is detected if liquids are observed to be dripping at a rate greater than three drops per minute.

              (5) After conducting the initial survey required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent monitoring at the frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(iii) of this section.
              (i) If the percentage leaking connectors is 2.0 percent or greater, the owner or operator shall monitor or inspect, as applicable, the connectors once per year.
              (ii) If the percentage leaking connectors is 1.0 percent or greater but less than 2.0 percent, the owner or operator shall monitor or inspect, as applicable, the connectors once every 2 years.
              (iii) If the percentage leaking connectors is less than 1.0 percent, the owner or operator shall monitor or inspect, as applicable, the connectors once every 4 years.
              (6) The percentage leaking connectors shall be calculated for connectors in gas/vapor service and for connectors in light liquid service. The data for the two groups of connectors shall not be pooled for the purpose of determining the percentage leaking connectors.

              (i) The percentage leaking connectors shall be calculated as follows:
              
              % CL = [(CL−CAN)/Ct + Cc)] × 100
              
              
                where:
                
                % CL = Percentage leaking connectors.
                CL = Number of connectors including nonrepairables, measured at 1,000 parts per million or greater, by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
                CAN = Number of allowable nonrepairable connectors, as determined by monitoring, not to exceed 3 percent of the total connector population, Ct.
                Ct = Total number of monitored connectors, including nonrepairables, in the process unit.
                Cc = Optional credit for removed connectors = 0.67 × net number (i.e., the total number of connectors removed minus the total added) of connectors in organic HAP service removed from the process unit after the applicability date set forth in § 63.640(h)(3)(iii) for existing process units, and after the date of start-up for new process units. If credits are not taken, then Cc = 0.
              
              
              (ii) Nonrepairable connectors shall be included in the calculation of percentage leaking connectors the first time the connector is identified as leaking and nonrepairable. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable connectors up to a maximum of 1 percent per year of the total number of connectors in organic HAP service up to a maximum of 3 percent may be excluded from calculation of percentage leaking connectors for subsequent monitoring periods.
              (iii) If the number of nonrepairable connectors exceeds 3 percent of the total number of connectors in organic HAP service, the number of nonrepairable connectors exceeding 3 percent of the total number shall be included in the calculation of the percentage leaking connectors.
              (7) Physical tagging of the connectors to indicate that they are subject to the monitoring provisions is not required. Connectors may be identified by the area or length of pipe and need not be individually identified.
              (d) Subpart H program. The owner or operator shall implement a program to comply with the provisions in § 63.174 of this part.
              (e) Delay of repair of connectors for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair is not technically feasible by normal repair techniques without a process unit shutdown. Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next process unit shutdown.
              (1) Delay of repair is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in organic HAP service.
              (2) Delay of repair for connectors is also allowed if:
              (i) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and
              (ii) When repair procedures are accomplished, the purged material would be collected and destroyed or recovered in a control device.
              (f) Any connector that is designated as an unsafe-to-repair connector is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), (c)(3) and (c)(4), or (d) of this section if:

              (1) The owner or operator determines that repair personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), (c)(3) and (c)(4), of this section; or
              
              (2) The connector will be repaired before the end of the next scheduled process unit shutdown.
              (g) The owner or operator shall maintain records to document that the connector monitoring or inspections have been conducted as required and to document repair of leaking connectors as applicable.

              § 63.652
              Emissions averaging provisions.
              (a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.642(g) by using emissions averaging according to § 63.642(l) rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651. Existing marine tank vessel loading operations located at the Valdez Marine Terminal source may not comply with the standard by using emissions averaging.
              (b) The owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.653(d) for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan shall identify all emission points to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.641) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average.
              (c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point:
              (1) Group 2 emission points;

              (2) Group 1 storage vessels, Group 1 wastewater streams, Group 1 gasoline loading racks, Group 1 marine tank vessels, and Group 1 miscellaneous process vents that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section; and
              (3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percentages of reduction for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead.
              (d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:
              (1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990;
              (2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting only the specifications stated in the reference control technology definition in § 63.641 (i.e., that meets the specifications of § 63.119(b) of subpart G but does not have controlled fittings per § 63.119 (b)(5) and (b)(6) of subpart G) applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control;
              (3) Emission points on shutdown process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits;
              (4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. Group 1 wastewater streams cannot be left undercontrolled or uncontrolled to generate debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms “wastewater” and “wastewater stream” are used to mean process wastewater; and
              (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.
              (e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall:
              (1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.

              (2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.
              (3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.
              (i) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions.
              (ii) After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations.
              (4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
              (5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.655(g)(8). Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.655(g)(8)(iii).
              (f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following:
              (1) More than 20 individual emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3) For emission points for which continuous monitors are used, periods of excess emissions as defined in § 63.655(g)(6)(i). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
              (i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.
              (ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.
              (iii) The owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section to demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned.
              (g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:
              (1) The overall equation for calculating sourcewide debits is:
              
                ER18AU95.002

                Debits and all terms of the equation are in units of megagrams per month, and
                EPViACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 miscellaneous process vent i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

                ESiACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 storage vessel i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
                (0.05) ESiu = Emissions from each Group 1 storage vessel i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions, calculated according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
                EGLRiACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 gasoline loading rack i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
                EGLRic = Emissions from each Group 1 gasoline loading rack i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
                EMVACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 marine tank vessel i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
                (0.03) EMViu = Emissions from each Group 1 marine tank vessel i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions calculated according to paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
                n = The number of Group 1 emission points being included in the emissions average. The value of n is not necessarily the same for each kind of emission point.
              
              
              (2) Emissions from miscellaneous process vents shall be calculated as follows:
              (i) For purposes of determining miscellaneous process vent stream flow rate, organic HAP concentrations, and temperature, the sampling site shall be after the final product recovery device, if any recovery devices are present; before any control device (for miscellaneous process vents, recovery devices shall not be considered control devices); and before discharge to the atmosphere. Method 1 or 1A of part 60, appendix A shall be used for selection of the sampling site.

              (ii) The following equation shall be used for each miscellaneous process vent i to calculate EPViu:
              
                ER18AU95.003
              
              
                where:
                
                EPViu = Uncontrolled process vent emission rate from miscellaneous process vent i, megagrams per month.

              (3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 calendar days of the submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish a Federal Register notice establishing a nominal efficiency for the control technology.
              (4) The Administrator may grant conditional permission to take emission credits for use of the control technology on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the specified nominal efficiency.

                n = Number of wastewater streams.
                QBi = Average flow rate for wastewater stream i before the pollution prevention measure, liters per minute.
                HBi = Number of hours per month that wastewater stream i was discharged before the pollution prevention measure, hours per month.
                s = Total number of organic HAP's in wastewater stream i.
                Fem = Fraction emitted of organic HAP m in wastewater from table 7 of this subpart, dimensionless.
                HAPBim = Average concentration of organic HAP m in wastewater stream i, defined and determined according to paragraph (h)(6)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, before the pollution prevention measure, parts per million by weight, as measured before the implementation of the pollution measure.
              
              

              (C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to July 14, 1994, records may be used to determine EB.

              (D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, Epp, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.
              (E) For wastewater, Epp shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER18AU95.038
              
              
                where n, Q, H, s, Fem, and HAP are defined and determined as described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section except that Qppi, Hppi, and HAPppim shall be determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.
              
              
              (iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percentage of reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.
              (iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percentage of reduction in emissions for each emission point must be calculated.

              (v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(6) of this section used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percentage of reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of a source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
              (k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the average will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the State or local permitting authority, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable.
              (1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made to the satisfaction of the State or local permitting authority.
              (i) The State or local permitting authority may require owners and operators to use specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk determination.
              (ii) The demonstration and approval of hazard or risk equivalency may be made according to any guidance that the EPA makes available for use.
              (2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their Implementation Plan.
              (3) An emissions averaging plan that does not demonstrate an equivalent or lower hazard or risk to the satisfaction of the State or local permitting authority shall not be approved. The State or local permitting authority may require such adjustments to the emissions averaging plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable.
              (4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall:
              (i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
              (ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and
              (iii) Meet any requirements set by the State or local permitting authority for such demonstrations.
              (l) For periods of excess emissions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of excess emissions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.655(g)(6).
              (2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures for demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.
              (3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the period of excess emissions and the other type of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.
              (4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.

              (7) If an emission point in an emissions average is controlled using a pollution prevention measure or a device or technique for which no monitoring parameters or inspection procedures are specified in §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable, the owner or operator shall establish a site-specific monitoring parameter and shall submit the information specified in § 63.655(h)(4) in the Implementation Plan.
              (b) Records of all information required to calculate emission debits and credits and records required by § 63.655 shall be retained for 5 years.
              (c) Notifications of Compliance Status report, Periodic Reports, and other reports shall be submitted as required by § 63.655.
              (d) Each owner or operator of an existing source who elects to comply with § 63.655(g) and (h) by using emissions averaging for any emission points shall submit an Implementation Plan.
              (1) The Implementation Plan shall be submitted to the Administrator and approved prior to implementing emissions averaging. This information may be submitted in an operating permit application, in an amendment to an operating permit application, in a separate submittal, in a Notification of Compliance Status Report, in a Periodic Report or in any combination of these documents. If an owner or operator submits the information specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section at different times, and/or in different submittals, later submittals may refer to earlier submittals instead of duplicating the previously submitted information.
              (2) The Implementation Plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(ix) of this section for all points included in the average.
              (i) The identification of all emission points in the planned emissions average and notation of whether each emission point is a Group 1 or Group 2 emission point as defined in § 63.641.

              § 63.654
              Heat exchange systems.
              (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator of a heat exchange system that meets the criteria in § 63.640(c)(8) must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.
              (b) A heat exchange system is exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section if all heat exchangers within the heat exchange system either:
              (1) Operate with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process side; or
              (2) Employ an intervening cooling fluid containing less than 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP, as determined according to the provisions of § 63.180(d) of this part and table 1 of this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid must serve to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and must not be sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.
              (c) The owner or operator must perform monitoring to identify leaks of total strippable volatile organic compounds (VOC) from each heat exchange system subject to the requirements of this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.
              (1) Monitoring locations for closed-loop recirculation heat exchange systems. For each closed loop recirculating heat exchange system, collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Each cooling tower return line or any representative riser within the cooling tower prior to exposure to air for each heat exchange system.
              (ii) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s).
              (2) Monitoring locations for once-through heat exchange systems. For each once-through heat exchange system, collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may also elect to collect and analyze an additional sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s). The selected monitoring location may be at a point where discharges from multiple heat exchange systems are combined provided that the combined cooling water flow rate at the monitoring location does not exceed 40,000 gallons per minute.

              (ii) The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems use the same water feed (i.e., inlet water from the same primary water source), the owner or operator may monitor at one representative location and use the monitoring results for that sampling location for all heat exchange systems that use that same water feed.
              (3) Monitoring method. Determine the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in parts per million by volume (ppmv) as methane) at each monitoring location using the “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” Revision Number One, dated January 2003, Sampling Procedures Manual, Appendix P: Cooling Tower Monitoring, prepared by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, January 31, 2003 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) using a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer for on-site determination as described in Section 6.1 of the Modified El Paso Method.
              (4) Monitoring frequency and leak action level for existing sources. For a heat exchange system at an existing source, the owner or operator must comply with the monitoring frequency and leak action level as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or comply with the monitoring frequency and leak action level as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator of an affected heat exchange system may choose to comply with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for some heat exchange systems at the petroleum refinery and comply with paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for other heat exchange systems. However, for each affected heat exchange system, the owner or operator of an affected heat exchange system must elect one monitoring alternative that will apply at all times. If the owner or operator intends to change the monitoring alternative that applies to a heat exchange system, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of such a change. All “leaks” identified prior to changing monitoring alternatives must be repaired. The monitoring frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section also apply to the inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system, if monitoring of the inlet water feed is elected as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Monitor monthly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 6.2 ppmv.
              (ii) Monitor quarterly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 3.1 ppmv unless repair is delayed as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. If a repair is delayed as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, monitor monthly.
              (5) Monitoring frequency and leak action level for new sources. For a heat exchange system at a new source, the owner or operator must monitor monthly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 3.1 ppmv.
              (6) Leak definition. A leak is defined as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) or (c)(6)(ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a leak is detected if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
              (ii) For all other heat exchange systems, a leak is detected if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in either paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.

              (d) If a leak is detected, the owner or operator must repair the leak to reduce the measured concentration to below the applicable action level as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. Repair includes re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified according to the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to verify that the measured concentration is below the applicable action level. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
              
              (1) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
              (2) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
              (3) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
              (4) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
              (5) Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
              (e) If the owner or operator detects a leak when monitoring a cooling tower return line under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may conduct additional monitoring of each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers associated with the heat exchange system for which the leak was detected as provided under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. If no leaks are detected when monitoring according to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the heat exchange system is considered to meet the repair requirements through re-monitoring of the heat exchange system as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (f) The owner or operator may delay the repair of a leaking heat exchanger when one of the conditions in paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section is met and the leak is less than the delay of repair action level specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The owner or operator must determine if a delay of repair is necessary as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after first identifying the leak.
              (1) If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monthly monitoring periods during the delay of repair, the owner or operator may delay repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange system. If, during subsequent monthly monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, the owner or operator must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
              (2) If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not available and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monthly monitoring periods during the delay of repair, the owner or operator may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner or operator must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent monthly monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, the owner or operator must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
              (3) The delay of repair action level is a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 62 ppmv. The delay of repair action level is assessed as described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
              (ii) For all other heat exchange systems, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in either paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
              (g) To delay the repair under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator must record the information in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) The reason(s) for delaying repair.
              (2) A schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.

              (3) The date and concentration of the leak as first identified and the results of all subsequent monthly monitoring events during the delay of repair.
              
              (4) An estimate of the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions from the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for each required delay of repair monitoring interval following the procedures in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) Determine the leak concentration as specified in paragraph (c) of this section and convert the stripping gas leak concentration (in ppmv as methane) to an equivalent liquid concentration, in parts per million by weight (ppmw), using equation 7-1 from “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” Revision Number One, dated January 2003, Sampling Procedures Manual, Appendix P: Cooling Tower Monitoring, prepared by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, January 31, 2003 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) and the molecular weight of 16 grams per mole (g/mol) for methane.
              (ii) Determine the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring location is an individual cooling tower riser, determine the total cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. Volumetric flow measurements may be used and converted to mass flow rates using the density of water at the specific monitoring location temperature or using the default density of water at 25 degrees Celsius, which is 997 kilograms per cubic meter or 8.32 pounds per gallon.
              (iii) For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of the leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring interval by multiplying the leak concentration in the cooling water, ppmw, determined in (g)(4)(i) of this section, by the mass flow rate of the cooling water determined in (g)(4)(ii) of this section and by the duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on the day the repair would have had to be completed if the repair had not been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the of the current monitoring event.
              (iv) For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval by the leak concentration and cooling water flow rates determined for the last monitoring event prior to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the time of the re-monitoring event that verified that the leak was repaired.

If an owner or operator claims that some of the performance evaluation information being submitted is CBI, the owner or operator must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic storage media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (h)(9)(ii)(A).
              (B) For any performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems measuring RATA pollutants that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site at the time of the evaluation, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.

              (10)(i) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) in the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date(s) and time(s) the CDX or CEDRI were unavailable when you attempted to access it in the 5 business days prior to the submission deadline; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

              (ii) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this paragraph, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (e.g., large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

              § 63.657
              Delayed coking unit decoking operation standards.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, each owner or operator of a delayed coking unit shall depressure each coke drum to a closed blowdown system until the coke drum vessel pressure or temperature measured at the top of the coke drum or in the overhead line of the coke drum as near as practical to the coke drum meets the applicable limits specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section prior to venting to the atmosphere, draining or deheading the coke drum at the end of the cooling cycle.
              (1) For delayed coking units at an existing affected source, meet either:
              (i) An average vessel pressure of 2 psig or less determined on a rolling 60-event average; or
              (ii) An average vessel temperature of 220 degrees Fahrenheit or less determined on a rolling 60-event average.
              (2) For delayed coking units at a new affected source, meet either:
              (i) A vessel pressure of 2.0 psig or less for each decoking event; or
              (ii) A vessel temperature of 218 degrees Fahrenheit or less for each decoking event.
              (b) Each owner or operator of a delayed coking unit complying with the pressure limits in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) of this section shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, to determine the coke drum vessel pressure.
              (1) The pressure monitoring system must be in a representative location (at the top of the coke drum or in the overhead line as near as practical to the coke drum) that minimizes or eliminates pulsating pressure, vibration, and, to the extent practical, internal and external corrosion.
              (2) The pressure monitoring system must be capable of measuring a pressure of 2.0 psig within ±0.5 psig.
              (3) The pressure monitoring system must be verified annually or at the frequency recommended by the instrument manufacturer. The pressure monitoring system must be verified following any period of more than 24 hours throughout which the pressure exceeded the maximum rated pressure of the sensor, or the data recorder was off scale.
              (4) All components of the pressure monitoring system must be visually inspected for integrity, oxidation and galvanic corrosion every 3 months, unless the system has a redundant pressure sensor.
              (5) The output of the pressure monitoring system must be reviewed each day the unit is operated to ensure that the pressure readings fluctuate as expected between operating and cooling/decoking cycles to verify the pressure taps are not plugged. Plugged pressure taps must be unplugged or otherwise repaired prior to the next operating cycle.
              (c) Each owner or operator of a delayed coking unit complying with the temperature limits in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a continuous parameter monitoring system to measure the coke drum vessel temperature (at the top of the coke drum or in the overhead line as near as practical to the coke drum) according to the requirements specified in table 13 of this subpart.

              (d) The owner or operator of a delayed coking unit shall determine the coke drum vessel pressure or temperature, as applicable, on a 5-minute rolling average basis while the coke drum is vented to the closed blowdown system and shall use the last complete 5-minute rolling average pressure or temperature just prior to initiating steps to isolate the coke drum prior to venting, draining or deheading to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section. Pressure or temperature readings after initiating steps to isolate the coke drum from the closed blowdown system just prior to atmospheric venting, draining, or deheading the coke drum shall not be used in determining the average coke drum vessel pressure or temperature for the purpose of compliance with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e) The owner or operator of a delayed coking unit using the “water overflow” method of coke cooling prior to complying with the applicable requirements in paragraph (a) of this section must meet the requirements in either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section or, if applicable, the requirements in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The owner or operator of a delayed coking unit using the “water overflow” method of coke cooling subject to this paragraph shall determine the coke drum vessel temperature as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and shall not otherwise drain or vent the coke drum until the coke drum vessel temperature is at or below the applicable limits in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (1) The overflow water must be directed to a separator or similar disengaging device that is operated in a manner to prevent entrainment of gases from the coke drum vessel to the overflow water storage tank. Gases from the separator or disengaging device must be routed to a closed blowdown system or otherwise controlled following the requirements for a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent. The liquid from the separator or disengaging device must be hardpiped to the overflow water storage tank or similarly transported to prevent exposure of the overflow water to the atmosphere. The overflow water storage tank may be an open or uncontrolled fixed-roof tank provided that a submerged fill pipe (pipe outlet below existing liquid level in the tank) is used to transfer overflow water to the tank.
              (2) The overflow water must be directed to a storage vessel meeting the requirements for storage vessels in subpart SS of this part.
              (3) Prior to November 26, 2020, if the equipment needed to comply with paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section are not installed and operational, you must comply with all of the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) The temperature of the coke drum, measured according to paragraph (c) of this section, must be 250 degrees Fahrenheit or less prior to initiation of water overflow and at all times during the water overflow.
              (ii) The overflow water must be hardpiped to the overflow water storage tank or similarly transported to prevent exposure of the overflow water to the atmosphere.
              (iii) The overflow water storage tank may be an open or uncontrolled fixed-roof tank provided that all of the following requirements are met.
              (A) A submerged fill pipe (pipe outlet below existing liquid level in the tank) is used to transfer overflow water to the tank.
              (B) The liquid level in the storage tank is at least 6 feet above the submerged fill pipe outlet at all times during water overflow.
              (C) The temperature of the contents in the storage tank remain below 150 degrees Fahrenheit at all times during water overflow.
              (f) The owner or operator of a delayed coking unit may partially drain a coke drum prior to achieving the applicable limits in paragraph (a) of this section in order to double-quench a coke drum that did not cool adequately using the normal cooling process steps provided that the owner or operator meets the conditions in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a continuous parameter monitoring system to measure the drain water temperature at the bottom of the coke drum or in the drain line as near as practical to the coke drum according to the requirements specified in table 13 of this subpart.
              (2) The owner or operator must maintain the drain water temperature below 210 degrees Fahrenheit during the partial drain associated with the double-quench event.

              § 63.658
              Fenceline monitoring provisions.

              (a) The owner or operator shall conduct sampling along the facility property boundary and analyze the samples in accordance with Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A of this part and paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section.
              (b) The target analyte is benzene.
              (c) The owner or operator shall determine passive monitor locations in accordance with Section 8.2 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part.
              (1) As it pertains to this subpart, known sources of VOCs, as used in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A of this part for siting passive monitors, means a wastewater treatment unit, process unit, or any emission source requiring control according to the requirements of this subpart, including marine vessel loading operations. For marine vessel loading operations, one passive monitor should be sited on the shoreline adjacent to the dock. For this subpart, an additional monitor is not required if the only emission sources within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary are equipment leak sources satisfying all of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) The equipment leak sources in organic HAP service within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary are limited to valves, pumps, connectors, sampling connections, and open-ended lines. If compressors, pressure relief devices, or agitators in organic HAP service are present within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary, the additional passive monitoring location specified in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A of this part must be used.
              (ii) All equipment leak sources in gas or light liquid service (and in organic HAP service), including valves, pumps, connectors, sampling connections and open-ended lines, must be monitored using EPA Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 no less frequently than quarterly with no provisions for skip period monitoring, or according to the provisions of § 63.11(c) Alternative Work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks. For the purpose of this provision, a leak is detected if the instrument reading equals or exceeds the applicable limits in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section:
              (A) For valves, pumps or connectors at an existing source, an instrument reading of 10,000 ppmv.
              (B) For valves or connectors at a new source, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv.
              (C) For pumps at a new source, an instrument reading of 2,000 ppmv.
              (D) For sampling connections or open-ended lines, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv above background.
              (E) For equipment monitored according to the Alternative Work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks, the leak definitions contained in § 63.11 (c)(6)(i) through (iii).
              (iii) All equipment leak sources in organic HAP service, including sources in gas, light liquid and heavy liquid service, must be inspected using visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method at least monthly. A leak is detected if the inspection identifies a potential leak to the atmosphere or if there are indications of liquids dripping.
              (iv) All leaks identified by the monitoring or inspections specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be repaired no later than 15 calendar days after it is detected with no provisions for delay of repair. If a repair is not completed within 15 calendar days, the additional passive monitor specified in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A of this part must be used.
              (2) The owner or operator may collect one or more background samples if the owner or operator believes that an offsite upwind source or an onsite source excluded under § 63.640(g) may influence the sampler measurements. If the owner or operator elects to collect one or more background samples, the owner or operator must develop and submit a site-specific monitoring plan for approval according to the requirements in paragraph (i) of this section. Upon approval of the site-specific monitoring plan, the background sampler(s) should be operated co-currently with the routine samplers.

              (3) If there are 19 or fewer monitoring locations, the owner or operator shall collect at least one co-located duplicate sample per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. If there are 20 or more monitoring locations, the owner or operator shall collect at least two co-located duplicate samples per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. The co-located duplicates may be collected at any of the perimeter sampling.
              (4) The owner or operator shall follow the procedure in Section 9.6 of Method 325B of appendix A of this part to determine the detection limit of benzene for each sampler used to collect samples, background samples (if the owner or operator elects to do so), co-located samples and blanks.
              (d) The owner or operator shall collect and record meteorological data according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) If a near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section or if an alternative test method is used that provides time-resolved measurements, the owner or operator shall:
              (i) Use an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part.
              (ii) Collect and record hourly average meteorological data, including temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction and calculate daily unit vector wind direction and daily sigma theta.
              (2) For cases other than those specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall collect and record sampling period average temperature and barometric pressure using either an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part or, alternatively, using data from a United States Weather Service (USWS) meteorological station provided the USWS meteorological station is within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of the refinery.
              (3) If an on-site meteorological station is used, the owner or operator shall follow the calibration and standardization procedures for meteorological measurements in EPA-454/B-08-002 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).
              (e) The owner or operator shall use a sampling period and sampling frequency as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Sampling period. A 14-day sampling period shall be used, unless a shorter sampling period is determined to be necessary under paragraph (g) or (i) of this section. A sampling period is defined as the period during which sampling tube is deployed at a specific sampling location with the diffusive sampling end cap in-place and does not include the time required to analyze the sample. For the purpose of this subpart, a 14-day sampling period may be no shorter than 13 calendar days and no longer than 15 calendar days, but the routine sampling period shall be 14 calendar days.
              (2) Base sampling frequency. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the frequency of sample collection shall be once each contiguous 14-day sampling period, such that the beginning of the next 14-day sampling period begins immediately upon the completion of the previous 14-day sampling period.
              (3) Alternative sampling frequency for burden reduction. When an individual monitor consistently achieves results at or below 0.9 µg/m3, the owner or operator may elect to use the applicable minimum sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for that monitoring site. When calculating Δc for the monitoring period when using this alternative for burden reduction, zero shall be substituted for the sample result for the monitoring site for any period where a sample is not taken.

              (i) If every sample at a monitoring site is at or below 0.9 µg/m3 for 2 years (52 consecutive samples), every other sampling period can be skipped for that monitoring site, i.e., sampling will occur approximately once per month.

              (ii) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m3 for 2 years (i.e., 26 consecutive “monthly” samples), five 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that monitoring site following each period of sampling, i.e., sampling will occur approximately once per quarter.

              (iii) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m3 for 2 years (i.e., 8 consecutive quarterly samples), twelve 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that monitoring site following each period of sampling, i.e., sampling will occur twice a year.

              (iv) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m3 for 2 years (i.e., 4 consecutive semiannual samples), only one sample per year is required for that monitoring site. For yearly sampling, samples shall occur at least 10 months but no more than 14 months apart.

              (v) If at any time a sample for a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section returns a result that is above 0.9 µg/m3, the sampling site must return to the original sampling requirements of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for one quarter (six 14-day sampling periods). If every sample collected during this quarter is at or below 0.9 µg/m3 , the owner or operator may revert back to the reduced monitoring schedule applicable for that monitoring site prior to the sample reading exceeding 0.9 µg/m3 If any sample collected during this quarter is above 0.9 µg/m3, that monitoring site must return to the original sampling requirements of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for a minimum of two years. The burden reduction requirements can be used again for that monitoring site once the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section are met again, i.e., after 52 contiguous 14-day samples with no results above 0.9 µg/m3 .
              (f) Within 45 days of completion of each sampling period, the owner or operator shall determine whether the results are above or below the action level as follows:
              (1) The owner or operator shall determine the facility impact on the benzene concentration (Δc) for each 14-day sampling period according to either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (i) Except when near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the highest and lowest sample results for benzene concentrations from the sample pool and calculate Δc as the difference in these concentrations. Co-located samples must be averaged together for the purposes of determining the benzene concentration for that sampling location, and, if applicable, for determining Δc. The owner or operator shall adhere to the following procedures when one or more samples for the sampling period are below the method detection limit for benzene:
              (A) If the lowest detected value of benzene is below detection, the owner or operator shall use zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.
              (B) If all sample results are below the method detection limit, the owner or operator shall use the method detection limit as the highest sample result and zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.
              (ii) When near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine Δc using the calculation protocols outlined in the approved site-specific monitoring plan and in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (2) The owner or operator shall calculate the annual average Δc based on the average of the 26 most recent 14-day sampling periods. The owner or operator shall update this annual average value after receiving the results of each subsequent 14-day sampling period.
              (3) The action level for benzene is 9 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) on an annual average basis. If the annual average Δc value for benzene is less than or equal to 9 µg/m3, the concentration is below the action level. If the annual average Δc value for benzene is greater than 9 µg/m3, the concentration is above the action level, and the owner or operator shall conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

              (g) Within 5 days of determining that the action level has been exceeded for any annual average Δc and no longer than 50 days after completion of the sampling period, the owner or operator shall initiate a root cause analysis to determine the cause of such exceedance and to determine appropriate corrective action, such as those described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section. The root cause analysis and initial corrective action analysis shall be completed and initial corrective actions taken no later than 45 days after determining there is an exceedance. Root cause analysis and corrective action may include, but is not limited to:
              (1) Leak inspection using Method 21 of part 60, appendix A-7 of this chapter and repairing any leaks found.
              (2) Leak inspection using optical gas imaging and repairing any leaks found.
              (3) Visual inspection to determine the cause of the high benzene emissions and implementing repairs to reduce the level of emissions.

              (4) Employing progressively more frequent sampling, analysis and meteorology (e.g., using shorter sampling periods for Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A of this part, or using active sampling techniques).
              (h) If, upon completion of the corrective action analysis and corrective actions such as those described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Δc value for the next 14-day sampling period for which the sampling start time begins after the completion of the corrective actions is greater than 9 µg/m3 or if all corrective action measures identified require more than 45 days to implement, the owner or operator shall develop a corrective action plan that describes the corrective action(s) completed to date, additional measures that the owner or operator proposes to employ to reduce fenceline concentrations below the action level, and a schedule for completion of these measures. The owner or operator shall submit the corrective action plan to the Administrator within 60 days after receiving the analytical results indicating that the Δc value for the 14-day sampling period following the completion of the initial corrective action is greater than 9 µg/m3 or, if no initial corrective actions were identified, no later than 60 days following the completion of the corrective action analysis required in paragraph (g) of this section.
              (i) An owner or operator may request approval from the Administrator for a site-specific monitoring plan to account for offsite upwind sources or onsite sources excluded under § 63.640(g) according to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall prepare and submit a site-specific monitoring plan and receive approval of the site-specific monitoring plan prior to using the near-field source alternative calculation for determining Δc provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The site-specific monitoring plan shall include, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The procedures in Section 12 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part are not required, but may be used, if applicable, when determining near-field source contributions.
              (i) Identification of the near-field source or sources. For onsite sources, documentation that the onsite source is excluded under § 63.640(g) and identification of the specific provision in § 63.640(g) that applies to the source.
              (ii) Location of the additional monitoring stations that shall be used to determine the uniform background concentration and the near-field source concentration contribution.
              (iii) Identification of the fenceline monitoring locations impacted by the near-field source. If more than one near-field source is present, identify the near-field source or sources that are expected to contribute to the concentration at that monitoring location.
              (iv) A description of (including sample calculations illustrating) the planned data reduction and calculations to determine the near-field source concentration contribution for each monitoring location.
              (v) If more frequent monitoring or a monitoring station other than a passive diffusive tube monitoring station is proposed, provide a detailed description of the measurement methods, measurement frequency, and recording frequency for determining the uniform background or near-field source concentration contribution.
              (2) When an approved site-specific monitoring plan is used, the owner or operator shall determine Δc for comparison with the 9 µg/m3 action level using the requirements specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) For each monitoring location, calculate Δci using the following equation.
              
              
                Δc
                i
                 = MFC
                i
                 − NFS
                i
                 − UB
              
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                Δci = The fenceline concentration, corrected for background, at measurement location i, micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3).
                MFCi = The measured fenceline concentration at measurement location i, µg/m3.
                NFSi = The near-field source contributing concentration at measurement location i determined using the additional measurements and calculation procedures included in the site-specific monitoring plan, µg/m3. For monitoring locations that are not included in the site-specific monitoring plan as impacted by a near-field source, use NFSi = 0 µg/m3.
                UB = The uniform background concentration determined using the additional measurements included in the site-specific monitoring plan, µg/m3. If no additional measurements are specified in the site-specific monitoring plan for determining the uniform background concentration, use UB = 0 µg/m3.

              (b) Pilot flame presence. The owner or operator shall operate each flare with a pilot flame present at all times when regulated material is routed to the flare. Each 15-minute block during which there is at least one minute where no pilot flame is present when regulated material is routed to the flare is a deviation of the standard. Deviations in different 15-minute blocks from the same event are considered separate deviations. The owner or operator shall monitor for the presence of a pilot flame as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
              (c) Visible emissions. The owner or operator shall specify the smokeless design capacity of each flare and operate with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours, when regulated material is routed to the flare and the flare vent gas flow rate is less than the smokeless design capacity of the flare. The owner or operator shall monitor for visible emissions from the flare as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.
              (d) Flare tip velocity. For each flare, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, provided the appropriate monitoring systems are in-place, whenever regulated material is routed to the flare for at least 15-minutes and the flare vent gas flow rate is less than the smokeless design capacity of the flare.

              (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the actual flare tip velocity (Vtip) must be less than 60 feet per second. The owner or operator shall monitor Vtipusing the procedures specified in paragraphs (i) and (k) of this section.
              (2) Vtip must be less than 400 feet per second and also less than the maximum allowed flare tip velocity (Vmax) as calculated according to the following equation.

                Where:
                
                Vmax = Maximum allowed flare tip velocity, ft/sec.
                NHVvg = Net heating value of flare vent gas, as determined by paragraph (l)(4) of this section, Btu/scf.
                1,212 = Constant.
                850 = Constant.
              
              
              (e) Combustion zone operating limits. For each flare, the owner or operator shall operate the flare to maintain the net heating value of flare combustion zone gas (NHVcz) at or above 270 British thermal units per standard cubic feet (Btu/scf) determined on a 15-minute block period basis when regulated material is routed to the flare for at least 15-minutes. The owner or operator shall monitor and calculate NHVcz as specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
              (f) Dilution operating limits for flares with perimeter assist air. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for each flare actively receiving perimeter assist air, the owner or operator shall operate the flare to maintain the net heating value dilution parameter (NHVdil) at or above 22 British thermal units per square foot (Btu/ft2) determined on a 15-minute block period basis when regulated material is being routed to the flare for at least 15-minutes. The owner or operator shall monitor and calculate NHVdil as specified in paragraph (n) of this section.

              (1) If the only assist air provided to a specific flare is perimeter assist air intentionally entrained in lower and/or upper steam at the flare tip and the effective diameter is 9 inches or greater, the owner or operator shall comply only with the NHVcz operating limit in paragraph (e) of this section for that flare.
              (2) [Reserved]
              
              (g) Pilot flame monitoring. The owner or operator shall continuously monitor the presence of the pilot flame(s) using a device (including, but not limited to, a thermocouple, ultraviolet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of detecting that the pilot flame(s) is present.
              (h) Visible emissions monitoring. The owner or operator shall conduct an initial visible emissions demonstration using an observation period of 2 hours using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. The initial visible emissions demonstration should be conducted the first time regulated materials are routed to the flare. Subsequent visible emissions observations must be conducted using either the methods in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or, alternatively, the methods in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The owner or operator must record and report any instances where visible emissions are observed for more than 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours as specified in § 63.655(g)(11)(ii).
              (1) At least once per day for each day regulated material is routed to the flare, conduct visible emissions observations using an observation period of 5 minutes using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. If at any time the owner or operator sees visible emissions while regulated material is routed to the flare, even if the minimum required daily visible emission monitoring has already been performed, the owner or operator shall immediately begin an observation period of 5 minutes using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. If visible emissions are observed for more than one continuous minute during any 5-minute observation period, the observation period using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 must be extended to 2 hours or until 5-minutes of visible emissions are observed. Daily 5-minute Method 22 observations are not required to be conducted for days the flare does not receive any regulated material.
              (2) Use a video surveillance camera to continuously record (at least one frame every 15 seconds with time and date stamps) images of the flare flame and a reasonable distance above the flare flame at an angle suitable for visual emissions observations. The owner or operator must provide real-time video surveillance camera output to the control room or other continuously manned location where the camera images may be viewed at any time.
              (i) Flare vent gas, steam assist and air assist flow rate monitoring. The owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording the volumetric flow rate in the flare header or headers that feed the flare as well as any flare supplemental gas used. Different flow monitoring methods may be used to measure different gaseous streams that make up the flare vent gas provided that the flow rates of all gas streams that contribute to the flare vent gas are determined. If assist air or assist steam is used, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording the volumetric flow rate of assist air and/or assist steam used with the flare. If pre-mix assist air and perimeter assist are both used, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of separately measuring, calculating, and recording the volumetric flow rate of premix assist air and perimeter assist air used with the flare. Flow monitoring system requirements and acceptable alternatives are provided in paragraphs (i)(1) through (6) of this section.

              (1) The flow rate monitoring systems must be able to correct for the temperature and pressure of the system and output parameters in standard conditions (i.e., a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) and a pressure of 1 atmosphere).
              (2) Mass flow monitors may be used for determining volumetric flow rate of flare vent gas provided the molecular weight of the flare vent gas is determined using compositional analysis as specified in paragraph (j) of this section so that the mass flow rate can be converted to volumetric flow at standard conditions using the following equation.
              
                
                ER01DE15.009
              
              
                Where:
                
                Qvol = Volumetric flow rate, standard cubic feet per second.
                Qmass = Mass flow rate, pounds per second.
                385.3 = Conversion factor, standard cubic feet per pound-mole.
                MWt = Molecular weight of the gas at the flow monitoring location, pounds per pound-mole.
              
              
              (3) Mass flow monitors may be used for determining volumetric flow rate of assist air or assist steam. Use equation in paragraph (i)(2) of this section to convert mass flow rates to volumetric flow rates. Use a molecular weight of 18 pounds per pound-mole for assist steam and use a molecular weight of 29 pounds per pound-mole for assist air.
              (4) Continuous pressure/temperature monitoring system(s) and appropriate engineering calculations may be used in lieu of a continuous volumetric flow monitoring systems provided the molecular weight of the gas is known. For assist steam, use a molecular weight of 18 pounds per pound-mole. For assist air, use a molecular weight of 29 pounds per pound-mole. For flare vent gas, molecular weight must be determined using compositional analysis as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (5) Continuously monitoring fan speed or power and using fan curves is an acceptable method for continuously monitoring assist air flow rates.
              (6) For perimeter assist air intentionally entrained in lower and/or upper steam, the monitored steam flow rate and the maximum design air-to-steam volumetric flow ratio of the entrainment system may be used to determine the assist air flow rate.
              (j) Flare vent gas composition monitoring. The owner or operator shall determine the concentration of individual components in the flare vent gas using either the methods provided in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section, to assess compliance with the operating limits in paragraph (e) of this section and, if applicable, paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Alternatively, the owner or operator may elect to directly monitor the net heating value of the flare vent gas following the methods provided in paragraphs (j)(3) of this section and, if desired, may directly measure the hydrogen concentration in the flare vent gas following the methods provided in paragraphs (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator may elect to use different monitoring methods for different gaseous streams that make up the flare vent gas using different methods provided the composition or net heating value of all gas streams that contribute to the flare vent gas are determined.

              (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring (i.e., at least once every 15-minutes), calculating, and recording the individual component concentrations present in the flare vent gas.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a grab sampling system capable of collecting an evacuated canister sample for subsequent compositional analysis at least once every eight hours while there is flow of regulated material to the flare. Subsequent compositional analysis of the samples must be performed according to Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6, ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2010), ASTM D1945-03 (Reapproved 2010), ASTM D1945-14 or ASTM UOP539-12 (all incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).

              (3) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a calorimeter capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording NHVvg at standard conditions.

              (4) If the owner or operator uses a continuous net heating value monitor according to paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator may, at their discretion, install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording the hydrogen concentration in the flare vent gas.
              (5) Direct compositional or net heating value monitoring is not required for purchased (“pipeline quality”) natural gas streams. The net heating value of purchased natural gas streams may be determined using annual or more frequent grab sampling at any one representative location. Alternatively, the net heating value of any purchased natural gas stream can be assumed to be 920 Btu/scf.
              (6) Direct compositional or net heating value monitoring is not required for gas streams that have been demonstrated to have consistent composition (or a fixed minimum net heating value) according to the methods in paragraphs (j)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a written application for an exemption from monitoring. The application must contain the following information:
              (A) A description of the flare gas stream/system to be considered, including submission of a portion of the appropriate piping diagrams indicating the boundaries of the flare gas stream/system and the affected flare(s) to be considered;
              (B) A statement that there are no crossover or entry points to be introduced into the flare gas stream/system (this should be shown in the piping diagrams) prior to the point where the flow rate of the gas streams is measured;

              (C) An explanation of the conditions that ensure that the flare gas net heating value is consistent and, if flare gas net heating value is expected to vary (e.g., due to product loading of different material), the conditions expected to produce the flare gas with the lowest net heating value;
              (D) The supporting test results from sampling the requested flare gas stream/system for the net heating value. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily measurement values (14 grab samples) for frequently operated flare gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. If the flare gas stream composition can vary, samples must be taken during those conditions expected to result in lowest net heating value identified in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(C) of this section. The owner or operator shall determine net heating value for the gas stream using either gas composition analysis or net heating value monitor (with optional hydrogen concentration analyzer) according to the method provided in paragraph (l) of this section; and

              (E) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of net heating values expected for the flare gas stream/system going to the affected flare (e.g., “the samples are representative of typical operating conditions of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare” or “the samples are representative of conditions expected to yield the lowest net heating value of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare”).
              (F) The net heating value to be used for all flows of the flare vent gas from the flare gas stream/system covered in the application. A single net heating value must be assigned to the flare vent gas either by selecting the lowest net heating value measured in the sampling program or by determining the 95th percent confidence interval on the mean value of all samples collected using the t-distribution statistic (which is 1.943 for 7 grab samples or 1.771 for 14 grab samples).
              (ii) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section.

              (iii) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (e.g., the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (j)(6)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
              
              (A) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is still within the range of net heating values included in the original application, the owner or operator shall determine the net heating value on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application is still appropriate.
              (B) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is lower than the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).

              (C) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value has greater variability in the flare gas stream/system such the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin monitoring the composition or net heat content of the flare vent gas stream using the methods in this section (i.e., grab samples every 8 hours until such time a continuous monitor, if elected, is installed).
              (k) Calculation methods for cumulative flow rates and determining compliance with Vtip operating limits. The owner or operator shall determine Vtip on a 15-minute block average basis according to the following requirements.
              (1) The owner or operator shall use design and engineering principles to determine the unobstructed cross sectional area of the flare tip. The unobstructed cross sectional area of the flare tip is the total tip area that vent gas can pass through. This area does not include any stability tabs, stability rings, and upper steam or air tubes because flare vent gas does not exit through them.
              (2) The owner or operator shall determine the cumulative volumetric flow of flare vent gas for each 15-minute block average period using the data from the continuous flow monitoring system required in paragraph (i) of this section according to the following requirements, as applicable. If desired, the cumulative flow rate for a 15-minute block period only needs to include flow during those periods when regulated material is sent to the flare, but owners or operators may elect to calculate the cumulative flow rates across the entire 15-minute block period for any 15-minute block period where there is regulated material flow to the flare.
              (i) Use set 15-minute time periods starting at 12 midnight to 12:15 a.m., 12:15 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. and so on concluding at 11:45 p.m. to midnight when calculating 15-minute block average flow volumes.

              (ii) If continuous pressure/temperature monitoring system(s) and engineering calculations are used as allowed under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, at a minimum, determine the 15-minute block average temperature and pressure from the monitoring system and use those values to perform the engineering calculations to determine the cumulative flow over the 15-minute block average period. Alternatively, the owner or operator may divide the 15-minute block average period into equal duration subperiods(e.g., three 5-minute periods) and determine the average temperature and pressure for each subperiod, perform engineering calculations to determine the flow for each subperiod, then add the volumetric flows for the subperiods to determine the cumulative volumetric flow of vent gas for the 15-minute block average period.
              (3) The 15-minute block average Vtip shall be calculated using the following equation.
              
                ER01DE15.010
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vtip = Flare tip velocity, feet per second.

                Area = Unobstructed area of the flare tip, square feet.
                900 = Conversion factor, seconds per 15-minute block average.
              
              

              (4) If the owner or operator chooses to comply with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall also determine the net heating value of the flare vent gas following the requirements in paragraphs (j) and (l) of this section and calculate Vmax using the equation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in order to compare Vtip to Vmax on a 15-minute block average basis.
              (l) Calculation methods for determining flare vent gas net heating value. The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value of the flare vent gas (NHVvg) based on the composition monitoring data on a 15-minute block average basis according to the following requirements.

              (1) If compositional analysis data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine NHVvg of a specific sample by using the following equation.
              
                ER01DE15.011
              
              
                Where:
                
                NHVvg = Net heating value of flare vent gas, Btu/scf.
                i = Individual component in flare vent gas.
                n = Number of components in flare vent gas.
                xi = Concentration of component i in flare vent gas, volume fraction.
                NHVi = Net heating value of component i according to table 12 of this subpart, Btu/scf. If the component is not specified in table 12 of this subpart, the heats of combustion may be determined using any published values where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere (or constant pressure) with offgas water in the gaseous state, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole of vent gas is 20 °C.
              
              

              (2) If direct net heating value monitoring data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(3) of this section but a hydrogen concentration monitor is not used, the owner or operator shall use the direct output of the monitoring system(s) (in Btu/scf) to determine the NHVvg for the sample.

              (3) If direct net heating value monitoring data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(3) of this section and hydrogen concentration monitoring data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the owner or operator shall use the following equation to determine NHVvg for each sample measured via the net heating value monitoring system.

                H2
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                NHVvg = Net heating value of flare vent gas, Btu/scf.
                
                NHVmeasured = Net heating value of flare vent gas stream as measured by the continuous net heating value monitoring system, Btu/scf.
                xH2 = Concentration of hydrogen in flare vent gas at the time the sample was input into the net heating value monitoring system, volume fraction.
                938 = Net correction for the measured heating value of hydrogen (1,212 − 274), Btu/scf.
              
              
              (4) Use set 15-minute time periods starting at 12 midnight to 12:15 a.m., 12:15 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. and so on concluding at 11:45 p.m. to midnight when calculating 15-minute block averages.

              (5) When a continuous monitoring system is used as provided in paragraph (j)(1) or (3) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the owner or operator may elect to determine the 15-minute block average NHVvg using either the calculation methods in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section or the calculation methods in paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator may choose to comply using the calculation methods in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section for some flares at the petroleum refinery and comply using the calculation methods (l)(5)(ii) of this section for other flares. However, for each flare, the owner or operator must elect one calculation method that will apply at all times, and use that method for all continuously monitored flare vent streams associated with that flare. If the owner or operator intends to change the calculation method that applies to a flare, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of such a change.
              (i) Feed-forward calculation method. When calculating NHVvg for a specific 15-minute block:
              (A) Use the results from the first sample collected during an event, (for periodic flare vent gas flow events) for the first 15-minute block associated with that event.
              (B) If the results from the first sample collected during an event (for periodic flare vent gas flow events) are not available until after the second 15-minute block starts, use the results from the first sample collected during an event for the second 15-minute block associated with that event.
              (C) For all other cases, use the results that are available from the most recent sample prior to the 15-minute block period for that 15-minute block period for all flare vent gas steams. For the purpose of this requirement, use the time that the results become available rather than the time the sample was collected. For example, if a sample is collected at 12:25 a.m. and the analysis is completed at 12:38 a.m., the results are available at 12:38 a.m. and these results would be used to determine compliance during the 15-minute block period from 12:45 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.
              (ii) Direct calculation method. When calculating NHVvg for a specific 15-minute block:
              (A) If the results from the first sample collected during an event (for periodic flare vent gas flow events) are not available until after the second 15-minute block starts, use the results from the first sample collected during an event for the first 15-minute block associated with that event.

              (B) For all other cases, use the arithmetic average of all NHVvg measurement data results that become available during a 15-minute block to calculate the 15-minute block average for that period. For the purpose of this requirement, use the time that the results become available rather than the time the sample was collected. For example, if a sample is collected at 12:25 a.m. and the analysis is completed at 12:38 a.m., the results are available at 12:38 a.m. and these results would be used to determine compliance during the 15-minute block period from 12:30 a.m. to 12:45 a.m.
              (6) When grab samples are used to determine flare vent gas composition:
              (i) Use the analytical results from the first grab sample collected for an event for all 15-minute periods from the start of the event through the 15-minute block prior to the 15-minute block in which a subsequent grab sample is collected.
              (ii) Use the results from subsequent grab sampling events for all 15 minute periods starting with the 15-minute block in which the sample was collected and ending with the 15-minute block prior to the 15-minute block in which the next grab sample is collected. For the purpose of this requirement, use the time the sample was collected rather than the time the analytical results become available.
              (7) If the owner or operator monitors separate gas streams that combine to comprise the total flare vent gas flow, the 15-minute block average net heating value shall be determined separately for each measurement location according to the methods in paragraphs (l)(1) through (6) of this section and a flow-weighted average of the gas stream net heating values shall be used to determine the 15-minute block average net heating value of the cumulative flare vent gas.
              (m) Calculation methods for determining combustion zone net heating value. The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value of the combustion zone gas (NHVcz) as specified in paragraph (m)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.

              (1) Except as specified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, determine the 15-minute block average NHVcz based on the 15-minute block average vent gas and assist gas flow rates using the following equation. For periods when there is no assist steam flow or premix assist air flow, NHVcz = NHVvg.

                QNG1 = Cumulative volumetric flow of flare supplemental gas during the previous 15-minute block period, scf. For the first 15-minute block period of an event, use the volumetric flow value for the current 15-minute block period, i.e., QNG1 = QNG2.
                NHVNG = Net heating value of flare supplemental gas for the 15-minute block period determined according to the requirements in paragraph (j)(5) of this section, Btu/scf.

              (n) Calculation methods for determining the net heating value dilution parameter. The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value dilution parameter (NHVdil) as specified in paragraph (n)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.

              (1) Except as specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section, determine the 15-minute block average NHVdil based on the 15-minute block average vent gas and perimeter assist air flow rates using the following equation only during periods when perimeter assist air is used. For 15-minute block periods when there is no cumulative volumetric flow of perimeter assist air, the 15-minute block average NHVdil parameter does not need to be calculated.

For 15-minute block periods when there is no cumulative volumetric flow of perimeter assist air, the 15-minute block average NHVdil parameter does not need to be calculated.

The flare minimization assessment must (at a minimum) consider the items in paragraphs (o)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. The assessment must provide clear rationale in terms of costs (capital and annual operating), natural gas offset credits (if applicable), technical feasibility, secondary environmental impacts and safety considerations for the selected minimization alternative(s) or a statement, with justifications, that flow reduction could not be achieved. Based upon the assessment, each owner or operator of an affected flare shall identify the minimization alternatives that it has implemented by the due date of the flare management plan and shall include a schedule for the prompt implementation of any selected measures that cannot reasonably be completed as of that date.

The plan should be updated periodically to account for changes in the operation of the flare, such as new connections to the flare or the installation of a flare gas recovery system, but the plan need be re-submitted to the Administrator only if the owner or operator alters the design smokeless capacity of the flare. The owner or operator must comply with the updated plan as submitted.

              (iii) All versions of the plan submitted to the Administrator shall also be submitted to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Sector Policies and Programs Division, U.S. EPA Mailroom (E143-01), Attention: Refinery Sector Lead, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Electronic copies in lieu of hard copies may also be submitted to refineryRTR@epa.gov.
              (3) The owner or operator of a flare subject to this subpart shall conduct a root cause analysis and a corrective action analysis for each flow event that contains regulated material and that meets either the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
              (i) The vent gas flow rate exceeds the smokeless capacity of the flare based on a 15-minute block average and visible emissions are present from the flare for more than 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours during the release event.
              (ii) The vent gas flow rate exceeds the smokeless capacity of the flare and the 15-minute block average flare tip velocity exceeds the maximum flare tip velocity determined using the methods in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

              (4) A root cause analysis and corrective action analysis must be completed as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after a flare flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. Special circumstances affecting the number of root cause analyses and/or corrective action analyses are provided in paragraphs (o)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
              (i) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single continuous flare flow event that meets both of the criteria in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (ii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single continuous flare flow event regardless of the number of 15-minute block periods in which the flare tip velocity was exceeded or the number of 2 hour periods that contain more the 5 minutes of visible emissions.

              (iii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single event that causes two or more flares that are operated in series (i.e., cascaded flare systems) to have a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
              (iv) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single event that causes two or more flares to have a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, regardless of the configuration of the flares, if the root cause is reasonably expected to be a force majeure event, as defined in this subpart.
              (v) Except as provided in paragraphs (o)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section, if more than one flare has a flow event that meets the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section during the same time period, an initial root cause analysis shall be conducted separately for each flare that has a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. If the initial root cause analysis indicates that the flow events have the same root cause(s), the initially separate root cause analyses may be recorded as a single root cause analysis and a single corrective action analysis may be conducted.
              (5) Each owner or operator of a flare required to conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis as specified in paragraphs (o)(3) and (4) of this section shall implement the corrective action(s) identified in the corrective action analysis in accordance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (o)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) All corrective action(s) must be implemented within 45 days of the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required or as soon thereafter as practicable. If an owner or operator concludes that no corrective action should be implemented, the owner or operator shall record and explain the basis for that conclusion no later than 45 days following the event.
              (ii) For corrective actions that cannot be fully implemented within 45 days following the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required, the owner or operator shall develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable.
              (iii) No later than 45 days following the event for which a root cause and corrective action analyses were required, the owner or operator shall record the corrective action(s) completed to date, and, for action(s) not already completed, a schedule for implementation, including proposed commencement and completion dates.

              (6) The owner or operator shall determine the total number of events for which a root cause and corrective action analyses was required during the calendar year for each affected flare separately for events meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) of this section and those meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(ii) of this section. For the purpose of this requirement, a single root cause analysis conducted for an event that met both of the criteria in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section would be counted as an event under each of the separate criteria counts for that flare. Additionally, if a single root cause analysis was conducted for an event that caused multiple flares to meet the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, that event would count as an event for each of the flares for each criteria in paragraph (o)(3) of this section that was met during that event. The owner or operator shall also determine the total number of events for which a root cause and correct action analyses was required and the analyses concluded that the root cause was a force majeure event, as defined in this subpart.
              (7) The following events would be a violation of this emergency flaring work practice standard.

              (iv) Three visible emissions exceedance events meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) of this section that were not caused by a force majeure event from a single flare in a 3 calendar year period for any reason.
              (v) Three flare tip velocity exceedance events meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(ii) of this section that were not caused by a force majeure event from a single flare in a 3 calendar year period for any reason.

              (e) Additional requirements for gas chromatographs. For monitors used to determine compositional analysis for net heating value per § 63.670(j)(1), the gas chromatograph must also meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) The quality assurance requirements are in table 13 of this subpart.
              (2) The calibration gases must meet one of the following options:
              (i) The owner or operator must use a calibration gas or multiple gases that include all of compounds listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) through (K) of this section that may be reasonably expected to exist in the flare gas stream and optionally include any of the compounds listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(L) through (O) of this section. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, the owner or operator must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases.
              (A) Hydrogen.
              (B) Methane.
              (C) Ethane.
              (D) Ethylene.
              (E) Propane.
              (F) Propylene.
              (G) n-Butane.
              (H) iso-Butane.

              (I) Butene (general). It is not necessary to separately speciate butene isomers, but the net heating value of trans-butene must be used for co-eluting butene isomers.
              (J) 1,3-Butadiene. It is not necessary to separately speciate butadiene isomers, but you must use the response factor and net heating value of 1,3-butadiene for co-eluting butadiene isomers.
              (K) n-Pentane. Use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify all C5+ hydrocarbons.
              (L) Acetylene (optional).
              (M) Carbon monoxide (optional).
              (N) Propadiene (optional).
              (O) Hydrogen sulfide (optional).
              (ii) The owner or operator must use a surrogate calibration gas consisting of hydrogen and C1 through C5 normal hydrocarbons. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, the owner or operator must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases.
              (3) If the owner or operator chooses to use a surrogate calibration gas under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

              (i) Use the response factor for the nearest normal hydrocarbon (i.e., n-alkane) in the calibration mixture to quantify unknown components detected in the analysis.
              (ii) Use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify unknown components detected in the analysis that elute after n-pentane.

An off-site material management unit is a tank, container, surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system used to manage off-site material. For the purpose of implementing the standards under this subpart, a unit that meets the definition of a tank or container but also is equipped with a vent that serves as a process vent for any of the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section is not an off-site material management unit but instead is a process vent and is to be included in the appropriate affected source group under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Examples of such a unit may include, but are not limited to, a distillate receiver vessel, a primary condenser, a bottoms receiver vessel, a surge control tank, a separator tank, and a hot well.
              (2) Process vents. For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of process equipment associated with the process vents for the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section.
              (i) Distillation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Distillation means a process, either batch or continuous, separating one or more off-site material feed streams into two or more exit streams having different component concentrations from those in the feed stream or streams. The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and vapor phases as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit.
              (ii) Fractionation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Fractionation means a liquid mixture separation process or method used to separate a mixture of several volatile components of different boiling points in successive stages, each stage removing from the mixture some proportion of one of the components.
              (iii) Thin-film evaporation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Thin-film evaporation means a liquid mixture separation process or method that uses a heating surface consisting of a large diameter tube that may be either straight or tapered, horizontal or vertical. Liquid is spread on the tube wall by a rotating assembly of blades that maintain a close clearance from the wall or actually ride on the film of liquid on the wall.
              (iv) Solvent extraction process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Solvent extraction means a separation process or method in which a solid or a solution is contacted with a liquid solvent (the material and the solvent being relatively insoluble in each other) to preferentially dissolve and transfer one or more components into the solvent.
              (v) Steam stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Steam stripping means a liquid mixture separation process or method in which vaporization of the volatile components of a liquid mixture occurs by the introduction of steam directly into the process.
              (vi) Gas stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Gas stripping means a desorption process or method used to transfer one or more volatile components from a liquid mixture into a gas stream either with or without the application of heat to the liquid. Packed towers, spray towers, and bubble-cap, sieve, or valve-type plate towers are examples of the process configurations used for contacting the gas and a liquid.
              (3) Equipment leaks. For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of equipment components for which each component meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If any one of these conditions do not apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the affected source for equipment leaks.
              (i) The equipment component is a pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system;
              (ii) The equipment component contains or contacts off-site material having a total HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight; and
              (iii) The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or more during a calendar year in off-site material service, as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart.
              (d) Facility-wide exemption. The owner or operator of affected sources subject to this subpart is exempted from the requirements of §§ 63.682 through 63.699 of this subpart in situations when the total annual quantity of the HAP that is contained in the off-site material received at the plant site is less than 1 megagram per year. For a plant site to be exempted under the provisions of this paragraph (d), the owner or operator must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.

              (1) The owner or operator must prepare an initial determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site. This determination is based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart as determined at the point-of-delivery for each off-site material stream.
              (2) The owner or operator must prepare a new determination whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the off-site material received at the plant site could cause the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site to exceed the limit of 1 megagram per year.
              (3) The owner or operator must maintain documentation to support the owner's or operator's determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site. This documentation must include the basis and data used for determining the HAP content of the off-site material.

                Separator means a waste management unit, generally a tank, used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include, but are not limited to, an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.
              
                Single-seal system means a floating roof having one continuous seal. This seal may be vapor-mounted, liquid-mounted, or a metallic shoe seal.
              
                Surface impoundment means a unit that is a natural topographical depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids.

                Tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.
              
              
                Transfer system means a stationary system for which the predominant function is to convey liquids or solid materials from one point to another point within a waste management operation or recovery operation. For the purpose of this subpart, the conveyance of material using a container (as defined for this subpart) or a self-propelled vehicle (e.g., a front-end loader) is not a transfer system. Examples of a transfer system include but are not limited to a pipeline, an individual drain system, a gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and a mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor).

                Treatment process means a process in which an off-site material stream is physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated to destroy, degrade, or remove hazardous air pollutants contained in the off-site material. A treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A treatment process can be used to treat one or more off-site material streams at the same time.
              
                Used oil means any oil refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. This definition is the same definition of “used oil” in 40 CFR 279.1.
              
                Used solvent means a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons or a mixture of one and two ring aromatic hydrocarbons that has been used as a solvent and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities.

As an alternative to using Method 305, an owner or operator may determine the HAP concentration of an off-site material using any one of the other test methods specified in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart. When a test method specified in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart other than Method 305 is used to determine the speciated HAP concentration of an off-site material, the individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding fm305 value listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP concentration.
              
                Waste means a material generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations or from community activities that is discarded, discharged, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated prior to being discarded or discharged.
              
                Waste management operation means the collection of off-site material management units, process vents, and equipment components used at a plant site to manage an off-site material stream from the point-of-delivery to the point where the waste exits or is discharged from the plant site or the waste is placed for on-site disposal in a unit not subject to this subpart (e.g., a waste incinerator, a land disposal unit).
              
                Waste stabilization process means any physical or chemical process used to either reduce the mobility of hazardous constituents in a waste or eliminate free liquids as determined by Test Method 9095—Paint Filter Liquids Test in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. (As an alternative, an owner or operator may use any more recent, updated version of Method 9095 approved by the EPA.) A waste stabilization process includes mixing the waste with binders or other materials and curing the resulting waste and binder mixture. Other synonymous terms used to refer to this process are “waste fixation” or “waste solidification.” A waste stabilization process does not include the adding of absorbent materials to the surface of a waste, without mixing, agitation, or subsequent curing, to absorb free liquid.

(1) For each off-site material management unit that is part of an affected source, the owner or operator must meet the requirements in either paragraph (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), or (b)(1)(iii) of this section except for those off-site material management units exempted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator controls air emissions from the off-site material management unit in accordance with the applicable standards specified in §§ 63.685 through 63.689 of this subpart.
              (ii) The owner or operator removes or destroys HAP in the off-site material before placing the material in the off-site material management unit by treating the material in accordance with the standards specified in § 63.684 of this subpart.
              (iii) The owner or operator determines before placing off-site material in the off-site material management unit that the average VOHAP concentration of the off-site material is less than 500 parts per million by weight (ppmw) at the point-of-delivery. The owner or operator must perform an initial determination of the average VOHAP concentration of the off-site material using the procedures specified in § 63.694(b) of this subpart. This initial determination must be performed either before the first time any portion of the off-site material stream is placed in the unit or by the compliance date, whichever date is later. Thereafter, the owner or operator must review and update, as necessary, this determination at least once every calendar year following the date of the initial determination for the off-site material stream.
              (2) An off-site material management unit is exempted from the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section when the owner or operator meets one of the exemptions provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iv) of this section as applicable to the unit.

If correction is required under section 6.3.3 of Method 301, the data are acceptable if the correction factor is within the range of 0.7 to 1.30. Other sections of Method 301 are not required.
              (iii) Calculations. The average VOHAP concentration (C) on a mass-weighted basis shall be calculated by using the results for all samples analyzed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and the following equation. An owner or operator using a test method that provides species-specific chemical concentrations may adjust the measured concentrations to the corresponding concentration values which would be obtained had the off-site material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the off-site material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (fm305) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.

                n = Total number of samples of the off-site material collected (at least 4) for the averaging period (not to exceed 1 year).
                Qi = Mass quantity of off-site material stream represented by Ci, kg/hr.

              (3) Knowledge of the off-site material to determine VOHAP concentration.
              (i) Documentation shall be prepared that presents the information used as the basis for the owner's or operator's knowledge of the off-site material stream's average VOHAP concentration. Examples of information that may be used as the basis for knowledge include: material balances for the source or process generating the off-site material stream; species-specific chemical test data for the off-site material stream from previous testing that are still applicable to the current off-site material stream; previous test data for other locations managing the same type of off-site material stream; or other knowledge based on information in documents such as manifests, shipping papers, or waste certification notices.
              (ii) If test data are used as the basis for knowledge, then the owner or operator shall document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in the determination of the average VOHAP concentration. For example, an owner or operator may use HAP concentration test data for the off-site material stream that are validated in accordance with Method 301 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A of this part as the basis for knowledge of the off-site material.

              (iii) An owner or operator using species-specific chemical concentration test data as the basis for knowledge of the off-site material may adjust the test data to the corresponding average VOHAP concentration value which would be obtained had the off-site material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the off-site material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (fm305) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.
              (iv) In the event that the Administrator and the owner or operator disagree on a determination of the average VOHAP concentration for an off-site material stream using knowledge, then the results from a determination of VOHAP concentration using direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be used to establish compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. The Administrator may perform or require that the owner or operator perform this determination using direct measurement.
              (c) Determination of average VOHAP concentration of an off-site material stream at the point-of-treatment.
              (1) Sampling. Samples of the off-site material stream shall be collected at the point-of-treatment in a manner such that volatilization of organics contained in the sample is minimized and an adequately representative sample is collected and maintained for analysis by the selected method.
              (i) The averaging period to be used for determining the average VOHAP concentration for the off-site material stream on a mass-weighted average basis shall be designated and recorded. The averaging period can represent any time interval that the owner or operator determines is appropriate for the off-site material stream but shall not exceed 1 year.
              (ii) A sufficient number of samples, but no less than four samples, shall be collected to represent the complete range of HAP compositions and HAP quantities that occur in the off-site material stream during the entire averaging period due to normal variations in the operating conditions for the treatment process. Examples of such normal variations are seasonal variations in off-site material quantity or fluctuations in ambient temperature.
              (iii) All samples shall be collected and handled in accordance with written procedures prepared by the owner or operator and documented in a site sampling plan. This plan shall describe the procedure by which representative samples of the off-site material stream are collected such that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling plan shall be maintained on-site in the plant site operating records. An example of an acceptable sampling plan includes a plan incorporating sample collection and handling procedures in accordance with the requirements specified in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846 or Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (2) Analysis. Each collected sample must be prepared and analyzed in accordance with one of the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (b)(2)(ii)(I) of this section, as applicable to the sampled off-site material, for the purpose of measuring the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart.
              (3) Calculations. The average VOHAP concentration (C) a mass-weighted basis shall be calculated by using the results for all samples analyzed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the following equation. An owner or operator using a test method that provides species-specific chemical concentrations may adjust the measured concentrations to the corresponding concentration values which would be obtained had the off-site material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the off-site material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (fm305) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.

(1) The maximum HAP vapor pressure of the off-site material composition managed in a tank shall be determined using either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section or by knowledge of the off-site material as specified by paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
              (2) Direct measurement to determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure of an off-site material.
              (i) Sampling. A sufficient number of samples shall be collected to be representative of the off-site material contained in the tank. All samples shall be collected and handled in accordance with written procedures prepared by the owner or operator and documented in a site sampling plan. This plan shall describe the procedure by which representative samples of the off-site material is collected such that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling plan shall be maintained on-site in the plant site operating records.

Documentation shall be prepared and recorded that presents the information used as the basis for the owner's or operator's knowledge that the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the off-site material is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit listed in Table 3, Table 4, or Table 5 of this subpart for the applicable tank design capacity category. Examples of information that may be used include: the off-site material is generated by a process for which at other locations it previously has been determined by direct measurement that the off-site material maximum HAP vapor pressure is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit for the appropriate tank design capacity category. In the event that the Administrator and the owner or operator disagree on a determination of the maximum HAP vapor pressure for an off-site material stream using knowledge, then the results from a determination of HAP vapor pressure using direct measurement as specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section shall be used to establish compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. The Administrator may perform or require that the owner or operator perform this determination using direct measurement.
              (k) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.

              (1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
              
              (2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
              (3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 8.1.1 of Method 21 shall be for the weighted average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit at the time of monitoring, not for each individual organic constituent.
              (4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppmv.
              (6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
              (8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (k)(8)(i) or (k)(8)(ii) of this section.
              (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.
              (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.
              (9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (k)(9)(i) and (k)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (k)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
              (ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (k)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (l) Control device performance test procedures. Performance tests shall be based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating conditions) and shall exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (1) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites at the inlet and outlet of the control device.

Method 18 may be used to measure methane and ethane, and the measured concentration may be subtracted from the Method 25A measurement. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 in appendix A of this part may be used. The following procedures shall be used to calculate percent reduction efficiency:
              (i) A minimum of three sample runs must be performed. The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour. For Method 18, either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken.

              (B) When the TOC mass rate is calculated, the average concentration reading (minus methane and ethane) measured by Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used in the equation in paragraph (l)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.

              (C) When the total HAP mass rate is calculated, only the HAP constituents shall be summed using the equation in paragraph (l)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.

              (A) The emission rate correction factor or excess air, integrated sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to determine the oxygen concentration (%O2dry). Alternatively, the owner or operator may use Method 3A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to determine the oxygen concentration. The samples shall be collected during the same time that the samples are collected for determining TOC concentration or total HAP concentration.

              (B) The concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen (Cc) shall be computed using the following equation:
              
                ER01JY96.047

              (ii) The owner or operator shall inspect the internal floating roof components as follows except as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section:
              (A) Visually inspect the internal floating roof components through openings on the fixed-roof (e.g., manholes and roof hatches) at least once every calendar year after initial fill, and
              (B) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, primary seal, secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes, and sleeve seals (if any) each time the tank is emptied and degassed and at least every 10 years. Prior to each inspection, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in accordance with the reporting requirements specified in § 63.697 of this subpart.
              (iii) As an alternative to performing the inspections specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for an internal floating roof equipped with two continuous seals mounted one above the other, the owner or operator may visually inspect the internal floating roof, primary and secondary seals, gaskets, slotted membranes, and sleeve seals (if any) each time the tank is emptied and degassed and at least every 5 years. Prior to each inspection, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in accordance with the reporting requirements specified in § 63.697 of this subpart.
              (iv) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (v) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.
              (2) Owners and operators that use a tank equipped with an external floating roof in accordance with the provisions of § 63.685(f) of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:

              (i) The owner or operator shall measure the external floating roof seal gaps in accordance with the following requirements:
              
              (A) The owner or operator shall perform measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the primary seal within 60 days after initial operation of the tank following installation of the floating roof and, thereafter, at least once every 5 years.

              (C) If a tank ceases to hold off-site material for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of off-site material into the tank shall be considered an initial operation for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
              (D) The owner shall determine the total surface area of gaps in the primary seal and in the secondary seal individually using the following procedure.
              (1) The seal gap measurements shall be performed at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof supports.
              (2) Seal gaps, if any, shall be measured around the entire perimeter of the floating roof in each place where a 0.32-centimeter (cm) (1/8-inch) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the tank and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
              (3) For a seal gap measured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the gap surface area shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
              (4) The total gap area shall be calculated by adding the gap surface areas determined for each identified gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually, and then dividing the sum for each seal type by the nominal diameter of the tank. These total gap areas for the primary seal and secondary seal are then compared to the respective standards for the seal type as specified in § 63.685(f)(1) of this subpart.
              (E) In the event that the seal gap measurements do not conform to the specifications in § 63.685(f)(1) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

Defects include, but are not limited to: holes, tears, or other openings in the rim seal or seal fabric of the floating roof; a rim seal detached from the floating roof; all or a portion of the floating roof deck being submerged below the surface of the liquid in the tank; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.
              (B) The owner or operator shall perform the inspections following installation of the external floating roof and, thereafter, at least once every year.
              (C) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (D) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696(d) of this subpart.
              (3) Owners and operators that use a tank equipped with a fixed roof in accordance with the provisions of § 63.685(g) of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:

              (i) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the separator wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices. In the case when a tank is buried partially or entirely underground, inspection is required only for those portions of the cover that extend to or above the ground surface, and those connections that are on such portions of the cover (e.g., fill ports, access hatches, gauge wells, etc.) and can be opened to the atmosphere.
              (ii) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the fixed roof. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.

              (i) The owner or operator shall within 45 calendar days of detecting the defect either repair the defect or empty the tank and remove it from service. If within this 45-day period the defect cannot be repaired or the tank cannot be removed from service without disrupting operations at the plant site, the owner or operator is allowed two 30-day extensions. In cases when an owner or operator elects to use a 30-day extension, the owner or operator shall prepare and maintain documentation describing the defect, explaining why alternative storage capacity is not available, and specify a schedule of actions that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the tank emptied as soon as possible.
              (ii) When a defect is detected during an inspection of a tank that has been emptied and degassed, the owner or operator shall repair the defect before refilling the tank.
              (c) Owners and operators that use a closed-vent system in accordance with the provisions of § 63.693 of this subpart shall meet the following inspection and monitoring requirements:

              (i) The closed-vent system shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in ductwork or piping; loose connections; or broken or missing caps or other closure devices.
              (ii) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the closed-vent system. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.

              (ii) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if either of the conditions specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) or (c)(3)(ii)(B) occurs. In this case, the owner or operator must repair the defect the next time the process or unit that vents to the closed-vent system is shutdown. Repair of the defect must be completed before the process or unit resumes operation.
              (A) Completion of the repair is technically infeasible without the shutdown of the process or unit that vents to the closed-vent system.
              (B) The owner or operator determines that the air emissions resulting from the repair of the defect within the specified period would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result by delaying the repair until the next time the process or unit that vents to the closed-vent system is shutdown.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.
              (d) Owners and operators that use a transfer system equipped with a cover in accordance with the provisions of § 63.689(c)(1) of this subpart shall meet the following inspection requirements:
              (1) The cover and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the cover sections or between the cover and its mounting; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices. In the case when a transfer system is buried partially or entirely underground, inspection is required only for those portions of the cover that extend to or above the ground surface, and those connections that are on such portions of the cover (e.g., access hatches, etc.) and can be opened to the atmosphere.
              (2) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the cover. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.

              (3) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
              
              (4) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.
              (5) The owner or operator shall repair all detected defects as follows:
              (i) The owner or operator shall make first efforts at repair of the defect no later than 5 calendar days after detection and repair shall be completed as soon as possible but no later than 45 calendar days after detection except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary removal from service of the transfer system and no alternative transfer system is available at the site to accept the material normally handled by the system. In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time the process or unit that is generating the material handled by the transfer system stops operation. Repair of the defect must be completed before the process or unit resumes operation.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.
              (e) Control device monitoring requirements. For each control device required under § 63.693 to be monitored in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (e), the owner or operator must ensure that each control device operates properly by monitoring the control device in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) A continuous parameter monitoring system must be used to measure the operating parameter or parameters specified for the control device in § 63.693(d) through § 63.693(g) of this subpart as applicable to the type and design of the control device. The continuous parameter monitoring system must meet the following specifications and requirements:
              (i) The continuous parameter monitoring system must measure either an instantaneous value at least once every 15 minutes or an average value for intervals of 15 minutes or less and continuously record either:
              (A) Each measured data value; or
              (B) Each block average value for each 1-hour period or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average instead of all measured values.
              (ii) The monitoring system must be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide reasonable assurance that the monitoring equipment is operating properly.
              (2) Using the data recorded by the monitoring system, the owner or operator must calculate the daily average value for each monitored operating parameter for each operating day. If operation of the control device is continuous, the operating day is a 24-hour period. If control device operation is not continuous, the operating day is the total number of hours of control device operation per 24-hour period. Valid data points must be available for 75 percent of the operating hours in an operating day to compute the daily average.
              (3) For each monitored operating parameter, the owner or operator must establish a minimum operating parameter value or a maximum operating parameter value, as appropriate, to define the range of conditions at which the control device must be operated to continuously achieve the applicable performance requirements specified in § 63.693(b)(2) of this subpart. Each minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section.

              (i) If the owner or operator conducts a performance test to demonstrate control device performance, then the minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established based on values measured during the performance test and supplemented, as necessary, by the control device design specifications, manufacturer recommendations, or other applicable information.
              
              (ii) If the owner or operator uses a control device design analysis to demonstrate control device performance, then the minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established based on the control device design analysis and supplemented, as necessary, by the control device manufacturer recommendations or other applicable information.
              (4) A deviation for a given control device is determined to have occurred when the monitoring data or lack of monitoring data result in any one of the criteria specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section being met. When multiple operating parameters are monitored for the same control device and during the same operating day more than one of these operating parameters meets a deviation criterion specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, then a single deviation is determined to have occurred for the control device for that operating day.
              (i) A deviation occurs when the daily average value of a monitored operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit (or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit) established for the operating parameter in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
              (ii) A deviation occurs when the period of control device operation is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and the monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours. Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.
              (iii) A deviation occurs when the period of control device operation is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than 1 of the hours during the period does not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data. Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.
              (5) For each deviation, except when the deviation occurs during periods of non-operation of the unit or the process that is vented to the control device (resulting in cessation of HAP emissions to which the monitoring applies), the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied control in a manner that achieves the required operating parameter limits. Failure to achieve the required operating parameter limits is a violation of this standard.
              (f) Alternative inspection and monitoring interval. Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a piece of air pollution control equipment in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as “unsafe to inspect and monitor.” The documentation must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.

              (2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.

            Subpart EE—National Emission Standards for Magnetic Tape Manufacturing Operations
            
              Source:
              59 FR 64596, Dec. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 63.701
              Applicability.
              (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of this subpart apply to:
              (1) Each new and existing magnetic tape manufacturing operation located at a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions; and

              (2) A magnetic tape manufacturing operation for which the owner or operator chooses to use the provisions of § 63.703(b) and (h) to obtain a Federally enforceable limit on its potential to emit HAP.
              
              
                Explanatory Note:
                A reason the owner or operator would make the choice described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is if the plant site, without this limit, would be a major source. The owner or operator could use this limit, which would establish the potential to emit from magnetic tape manufacturing operations, in conjunction with the potential to emit from the other HAP emission points at the stationary source, to be an area source. Note, however, that an owner or operator is not required to use the provisions in § 63.703(b) and (h) to determine the potential to emit HAP from magnetic tape manufacturing operations.
              
              
              (b) This subpart does not apply to the following:
              (1) Research or laboratory facilities; and
              (2) Any coating operation that produces a quantity of magnetic tape that is 1 percent or less of total production (in terms of total square footage coated) from that coating operation in any 12-month period.
              (c) The affected source subject to this standard is the magnetic tape manufacturing operation, as defined in § 63.702.
              (d) An owner or operator of an existing affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply according to the following schedule:
              (1) Within 3 years after the effective date of the standard, if the owner or operator is required to install a new add-on air pollution control device to meet the requirements of § 63.703(c) or (g); or
              (2) Within 2 years after the effective date of the standard, if a new add-on air pollution control device is not needed to comply with § 63.703(c) or (g) of these standards.
              (e) The compliance date for an owner or operator of a new affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart is immediately upon startup of the affected source.
              (f) The provisions of this subpart apply during periods of startup and shutdown, and whenever magnetic tape manufacturing operations are taking place.

              (g) Owners or operators of affected sources subject to the provisions of this subpart shall also comply with the requirements of subpart A as identified in Table 1, according to the applicability of subpart A to such sources.
              
              (h) In any title V permit for an affected source, all research or laboratory facilities that are exempt from the requirements of this subpart shall be clearly identified.
            
            
              § 63.702
              Definitions.
              (a) All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have the meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act and in subpart A of this part.
              
                Add-on air pollution control device means equipment installed at the end of a process vent exhaust stack or stacks that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to the air. The device may destroy or secure the pollutant for subsequent recovery. Examples are incinerators, condensers, carbon adsorbers, and biofiltration units. Transfer equipment and ductwork are not considered in and of themselves add-on air pollution control devices.
              
                Bag slitter means a device for enclosed transfer of particulates. A bag of raw materials is placed in a hopper, the hopper is closed, and an internal mechanism slits the bag, releasing the particulates into either a closed conveyor that feeds the mix preparation equipment or into the mix preparation equipment itself.
              
                Base substrate means the surface, such as plastic or paper, to which a coating is applied.
              
                Capture efficiency means the fraction of all organic vapors or other pollutants generated by a process that are directed to an add-on air pollution control device.

              (f) An owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device not listed in § 63.704 to comply with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(i), or (i), or a device other than a steam stripper to comply with § 63.703(g) shall submit to the Administrator a description of the device, test data verifying the performance of the device, and appropriate site-specific operating parameters that will be monitored to demonstrate continuous compliance with the standard. The monitoring plan submitted by an owner or operator in accordance with this paragraph is subject to approval by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 63.705
              Performance test methods and procedures to determine initial compliance.
              (a) Except as specified in § 63.705(a) (1) through (3), to determine initial compliance with the emission limits under § 63.703 (c), (d)(2), (e)(1), (f)(1), and (g), the owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance demonstration as required under § 63.7 using the procedures and test methods listed in § 63.7 and § 63.705. If multiple emission points are vented to one common control device to meet the requirements of § 63.703 (c), (d)(2), (e)(1), and (f)(1), only one performance test is required to demonstrate initial compliance for that group of emission points. This section also contains initial compliance demonstration procedures (other than testing) for owners or operators subject to § 63.703 (c), (d)(1), (e)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(ii), and (g).
              (1) A control device (not enclosure) used to comply with § 63.703 (c), (e), or (f) does not need to be tested if each of the following criteria are met:
              (i) It is used to control gaseous HAP emissions from an existing affected source;
              (ii) It is operating prior to March 11, 1994;
              (iii) It is equipped with continuous emission monitors for determining inlet and outlet total HAP or VOC concentration, such that a percent efficiency can be calculated; and
              (iv) The continuous emission monitors are used to demonstrate continuous compliance in accordance with § 63.704(c)(3)(i).
              (2) The owner or operator is not required to conduct an initial performance test if the requirements of § 63.7(e)(2)(iv) or § 63.7(h) are met.
              (3) An owner or operator is not required to conduct an initial performance test for a capture device when:
              (i) The room, enclosure, or vent was previously tested to demonstrate compliance with subpart SSS of part 60; and
              (ii) Sufficient data were gathered during the test to establish operating parameter values in accordance with § 63.704(b)(6) (i), (ii), and (iii).
              (b) When an initial compliance demonstration is required by this subpart, the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this section shall be used in determining initial compliance with the provisions of this subpart.

              (1) EPA Method 24 of appendix A of part 60 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that plant coating formulation data are equivalent to EPA Method 24 results, formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between an EPA Method 24 test and an affected source's formulation data, the EPA Method 24 test will govern. For EPA Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample taken into a 1-liter container at a location and time such that the sample will be representative of the coating applied to the base substrate (i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed immediately after the sample is taken. Any solvent or other VOC added after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the calculations that use EPA Method 24 results.
              (2) Formulation data is used to determine the HAP content of coatings.
              (3) Either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A of appendix A of part 60, as appropriate to the conditions at the site, shall be used to determine HAP or VOC concentration of air exhaust streams as required by § 63.705(c). The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with the notification of the performance test required under § 63.7(b). Method selection shall be based on consideration of the diversity of organic species present and their total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence of interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
              (i) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual carbon adsorber vessels pursuant to § 63.705(c) (2) or (4), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all of the individual carbon adsorber vessels.
              (ii) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel pursuant to § 63.705(c) (3) or (4), each carbon adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each carbon adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
              (4) EPA Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of part 60 is used for sample and velocity traverses.
              (5) EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60 is used for velocity and volumetric flow rates.
              (6) EPA Method 3 of appendix A of part 60 is used for gas analysis.
              (7) EPA Method 4 of appendix A of part 60 is used for stack gas moisture.
              (8) EPA Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test period.
              (9) Wastewater analysis shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(i) or (b)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Use Method 305 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A and the equations in paragraphs (b)(9)(i) (A) and (B) of this section to determine the total VOHAP concentration of a wastewater stream.
              (A) The following equation shall be used to calculate the VOHAP concentration of an individually speciated HAP.
              
                ER15DE94.003
              
              
                
                where:
                
                Ci = VOHAP concentration of the individually-speciated organic HAP in the wastewater, parts per million by weight.
                Cc = Concentration of the organic HAP (i) in the gas stream, as measured by Method 305 of appendix A of this part, parts per million by volume on a dry basis.
                Ms = Mass of sample, from Method 305 of appendix A of this part, milligrams.
                MW = Molecular weight of the organic HAP (i), grams per gram-mole.
                24.055 = Ideal gas molar volume at 293° Kelvin and 760 millimeters of mercury, liters per gram-mole.
                Pi = Barometric pressure at the time of sample analysis, millimeters mercury absolute.
                760 = Reference or standard pressure, millimeters mercury absolute.
                293 = Reference or standard temperature, °Kelvin.
                Ti = Sample gas temperature at the time of sample analysis, °Kelvin.
                t = Actual purge time, from Method 305 of appendix A of this part, minutes.
                L = Actual purge rate, from Method 305 of appendix A of this part, liters per minute.
                103 = Conversion factor, milligrams per gram.
              
              
              (B) Total VOHAP concentration (stream) can be determined by summing the VOHAP concentrations of all individually speciated organic HAP in the wastewater.
              
                ER15DE94.004
              
              
                where:
                
                Cstream = Total VOHAP concentration of wastewater stream.
                n = Number of individual organic HAP (i) in the wastewater stream.
                Ci = VOHAP concentration of individual organic HAP (i) calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section.
              
              
              (ii) Use a test method or results from a test method that measures organic HAP concentrations in the wastewater, and that has been validated according to section 5.1 or 5.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. The specific requirement of Method 305 of appendix A of this part to collect the sample into polyethylene glycol would not be applicable.

              (A) If measuring the total VOHAP concentration of the exit stream in accordance with §§ 63.703(g)(1)(ii) and 63.705(h)(2), the concentrations of the individual organic HAP measured in the water shall be corrected to their concentrations had they been measured by Method 305 of appendix A of this part. This is done by multiplying each concentration by the compound-specific fraction measured factor (FM) listed in table 34 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart G.
              (B) If measuring the total HAP concentration of an inlet and outlet wastewater stream to demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(g)(1)(i) and following the procedures of § 63.705(h)(3), the concentrations of the individual organic HAP measured in the water do not need to be corrected.
              (10) EPA Method 22 of appendix A of part 60 is used to determine visible emissions. Visible emissions testing shall be conducted for a minimum of 6 minutes during a time when particulate HAP transfer, as defined in this subpart, is occurring.
              (c) Initial compliance demonstrations.

Each owner or operator subject to § 63.703(d), (e), (f), and (g) must demonstrate initial compliance with the requirements of this subpart by following the procedures of paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this section, as appropriate.

              (1) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4) when emissions from only the affected coating operations are controlled by a dedicated solvent recovery device, each owner or operator of the affected coating operation may perform a liquid-liquid HAP or VOC material balance over rolling 7-day periods in lieu of demonstrating compliance through the methods in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) of this section. Results of the material balances calculation performed to demonstrate initial compliance shall be submitted to the Administrator with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.9(h) and § 63.707(d). When demonstrating compliance by this procedure, § 63.7(e)(3) of subpart A does not apply. The amount of liquid HAP or VOC applied and recovered shall be determined as discussed in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. The overall HAP or VOC emission reduction (R) is calculated using equation 1:
              
                ER15DE94.005
              
              (i) The value of RSi is zero unless the owner or operator submits the following information to the Administrator for approval of a measured RSi value that is greater than zero:
              (A) Measurement techniques; and

                ER15DE94.007
              
              (vi) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.703, compliance is demonstrated if either of the following conditions are met:
              (A) The product of (E) × (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4); or

              (3) To demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4) when affected HAP emission points are controlled by a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel, each owner or operator of an affected source shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:
              (i) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that each volumetric flow rate and the total HAP emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 63.705(b) (3) through (8);
              (ii) Assure that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are segregated from gaseous emission points not affected by this subpart and that the emissions can be captured for measurement, as described in § 63.705(c)(2)(ii) (A) and (B);
              (iii) Operate the emission control device with all affected HAP emission points connected and operating;

              (vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the capture system using equation (3).

              (vii) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.703(c), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (Hsys) × (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4).
              (4) An alternative method of demonstrating compliance with § 63.703(c)(1) through (c)(4) is the installation of a total enclosure around the affected HAP emission point(s) and the ventilation of all HAP emissions from the total enclosure to a control device with the efficiency or outlet concentration specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. If this method is selected, the compliance test methods described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section are not required. Instead, each owner or operator of an affected source shall:
              (i) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. An enclosure that meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section shall be considered a total enclosure. The owner or operator of an enclosure that does not meet these requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are contained and vented to the control device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
              (A) Total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5 percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;

              (B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;
              (C) Average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft openings shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:
              (1) All forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts are constructed so that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.705(b) (4) and (5); volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment normally made for moisture content; and
              (2) Determine FV by equation 6:

              (D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without verification.
              (ii) Determine the control device efficiency using equation (2) or equations (4) and (5), as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.705(b) (3) through (8).

                Eb = HAP mass flow rate of an individually speciated HAP compound entering the treatment process, kilograms per hour.
                Ea = HAP mass flow rate of an individually speciated HAP compound exiting the treatment process, kilograms per hour.
                K = Density of the wastewater stream, kilograms per cubic meter.
                Vbp = Average volumetric flow rate of wastewater entering the treatment process during each run p, cubic meters per hour.
                Vap = Average volumetric flow rate of wastewater exiting the treatment process during each run p, cubic meters per hour.

                Temporary total enclosure means a total enclosure that is constructed for the sole purpose of measuring the emissions from an affected source that are not delivered to an emission control device. A temporary total enclosure must be constructed and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal impact on the performance of the permanent emission capture system. A temporary total enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in § 63.750(g)(4) and if all natural draft openings are at least four duct or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.
              
                Topcoat means a coating that is applied over a primer on an aerospace vehicle or component for appearance, identification, camouflage, or protection. Coatings that are defined as specialty coatings are not included under this definition.

There are no fugitive emissions from a total enclosure. The only openings in a total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are acceptable, but if such openings are routine or if an access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure. An enclosure that meets the requirements found in § 63.750(g)(4) is a permanent total enclosure.
              
                Touch-up and repair operation means that portion of the coating operation that is the incidental application of coating used to cover minor imperfections in the coating finish or to achieve complete coverage.

For purposes of determining compliance with emission limits, VOC will be measured by the approved test methods. Where such a method also inadvertently measures compounds that are exempt solvent, an owner or operator may exclude these exempt solvents when determining compliance with an emission standard.
              
                Waterborne (water-reducible) coating means any coating that contains more than 5 percent water by weight as applied in its volatile fraction.
              
                Waterwash system means a control system that utilizes flowing water (i.e., a conventional waterwash system) or a pumpless system to remove particulate emissions from the exhaust air stream in spray coating application or dry media blast depainting operations.

              (e) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

              (a) Housekeeping measures. Each owner or operator of a new or existing cleaning operation subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section unless the cleaning solvent used is identified in Table 1 of this section or meets the definition of “Non-HAP material” in 63.742. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section do not apply to spent cleaning solvents, and solvent-laden applicators that are subject to and handled and stored in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262 through 268 (including the air emission control requirements in 40 CFR part 265, subpart CC).
              (1) Unless the owner or operator satisfies the requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, place used solvent-laden cloth, paper, or any other absorbent applicators used for cleaning in bags or other closed containers. Ensure that these bags and containers are kept closed at all times except when depositing or removing these materials from the container. Use bags and containers of such design so as to contain the vapors of the cleaning solvent. Cotton-tipped swabs used for very small cleaning operations are exempt from this requirement.
              (2) Unless the owner or operator satisfies the requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, store fresh and spent cleaning solvents, except semi-aqueous solvent cleaners, used in aerospace cleaning operations in closed containers.
              (3) Conduct the handling and transfer of cleaning solvents to or from enclosed systems, vats, waste containers, and other cleaning operation equipment that hold or store fresh or spent cleaning solvents in such a manner that minimizes spills.
              (4) Demonstrate to the Administrator (or delegated State, local, or Tribal authority) that equivalent or better alternative measures are in place compared to the use of closed containers for the solvent-laden materials described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the storage of solvents described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (b) Hand-wipe cleaning. Each owner or operator of a new or existing hand-wipe cleaning operation (excluding cleaning of spray gun equipment performed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section) subject to this subpart shall use cleaning solvents that meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section. Cleaning solvent solutions that contain HAP and VOC below the de minimis levels specified in § 63.741(f) are exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section.
              (1) Meet one of the composition requirements in Table 1 of this section;

              (2) Have a composite vapor pressure of 45 mm Hg (24.1 in. H2 O) or less at 20 °C (68 °F); or
              (3) Demonstrate that the volume of hand-wipe solvents used in cleaning operations has been reduced by at least 60% from a baseline adjusted for production. The baseline shall be established as part of an approved alternative plan administered by the State. Demonstrate that the volume of hand-wipe cleaning solvents used in cleaning operations has been reduced by at least 60 percent from a baseline adjusted for production. The baseline shall be calculated using data from 1996 and 1997, or as otherwise agreed upon by the Administrator or delegated State Authority. The baseline shall be approved by the Administrator or delegated State Authority and shall be included as part of the facility's title V or part 70 permit.
              (c) Spray gun cleaning. Each owner or operator of a new or existing spray gun cleaning operation subject to this subpart in which spray guns are used for the application of coatings or any other materials that require the spray guns to be cleaned shall use one or more of the techniques, or their equivalent, specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Spray gun cleaning operations using cleaning solvent solutions that contain HAP and VOC below the de minimis levels specified in § 63.741(f) are exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
              (1)(i) Enclosed system. Clean the spray gun in an enclosed system that is closed at all times except when inserting or removing the spray gun. Cleaning shall consist of forcing solvent through the gun.

              (ii) If leaks are found during the monthly inspection required in § 63.751(a), repairs shall be made as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 days after the leak was found. If the leak is not repaired by the 15th day after detection, the cleaning solvent shall be removed, and the enclosed cleaner shall be shut down until the leak is repaired or its use is permanently discontinued.
              
              (2) Nonatomized cleaning. Clean the spray gun by placing cleaning solvent in the pressure pot and forcing it through the gun with the atomizing cap in place. No atomizing air is to be used. Direct the cleaning solvent from the spray gun into a vat, drum, or other waste container that is closed when not in use.
              (3) Disassembled spray gun cleaning. Disassemble the spray gun and clean the components by hand in a vat, which shall remain closed at all times except when in use. Alternatively, soak the components in a vat, which shall remain closed during the soaking period and when not inserting or removing components.
              (4) Atomizing cleaning. Clean the spray gun by forcing the cleaning solvent through the gun and direct the resulting atomized spray into a waste container that is fitted with a device designed to capture the atomized cleaning solvent emissions.
              (5) Cleaning of the nozzle tips of automated spray equipment systems, except for robotic systems that can be programmed to spray into a closed container, shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (d) Flush cleaning. Each owner or operator of a flush cleaning operation subject to this subpart (excluding those in which Table 1 or semi-aqueous cleaning solvents are used) shall empty the used cleaning solvent each time aerospace parts or assemblies, or components of a coating unit (with the exception of spray guns) are flush cleaned into an enclosed container or collection system that is kept closed when not in use or into a system with equivalent emission control.
              (e) Exempt cleaning operations. The following cleaning operations are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:
              (1) Cleaning during the manufacture, assembly, installation, maintenance, or testing of components of breathing oxygen systems that are exposed to the breathing oxygen;
              (2) Cleaning during the manufacture, assembly, installation, maintenance, or testing of parts, subassemblies, or assemblies that are exposed to strong oxidizers or reducers (e.g., nitrogen tetroxide, liquid oxygen, or hydrazine);
              (3) Cleaning and surface activation prior to adhesive bonding;
              (4) Cleaning of electronic parts and assemblies containing electronic parts;
              (5) Cleaning of aircraft and ground support equipment fluid systems that are exposed to the fluid, including air-to-air heat exchangers and hydraulic fluid systems;
              (6) Cleaning of fuel cells, fuel tanks, and confined spaces;
              (7) Surface cleaning of solar cells, coated optics, and thermal control surfaces;
              (8) Cleaning during fabrication, assembly, installation, and maintenance of upholstery, curtains, carpet, and other textile materials used in the interior of the aircraft;
              (9) Cleaning of metallic and nonmetallic materials used in honeycomb cores during the manufacture or maintenance of these cores, and cleaning of the completed cores used in the manufacture of aerospace vehicles or components;
              (10) Cleaning of aircraft transparencies, polycarbonate, or glass substrates;
              (11) Cleaning and cleaning solvent usage associated with research and development, quality control, and laboratory testing;
              (12) Cleaning operations, using nonflamable liquids, conducted within five feet of energized electrical systems. Energized electrical systems means any AC or DC electrical circuit on an assembled aircraft once electrical power is connected, including interior passenger and cargo areas, wheel wells and tail sections; and

              (13) Cleaning operations identified as essential uses under the Montreal Protocol for which the Administrator has allocated essential use allowances or exemptions in 40 CFR 82.4.

Coating limits for VOC are expressed in terms of mass (grams or pounds) of VOC per volume (liters or gallons) of coating less water and less exempt solvent.
              
              (d) Controlled coatings—control system requirements. Each control system shall reduce the operation's organic HAP and VOC emissions to the atmosphere by 81% or greater, taking into account capture and destruction or removal efficiencies, as determined using the procedures in § 63.750(g) when a carbon adsorber is used and in § 63.750(h) when a control device other than a carbon adsorber is used.
              (e) Compliance methods. Compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content limits specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section shall be accomplished by using the methods specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section either by themselves or in conjunction with one another.
              (1) Use primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), and specialty coatings with HAP and VOC content levels equal to or less than the limits specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section; or
              (2) Use the averaging provisions described in § 63.743(d).
              (f) Application equipment. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, each owner or operator of a new or existing primer, topcoat (including self-priming topcoat), or specialty coating application operation subject to this subpart in which any of the coatings contain organic HAP or VOC shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.
              (1) All spray applied primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), and specialty coatings shall be applied using one or more of the spray application techniques specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(v) of this section.
              (i) High volume low pressure (HVLP) spraying;
              (ii) Electrostatic spray application;
              (iii) Airless spray application;
              (iv) Air-assisted airless spray application; or
              (v) Any other coating spray application methods that achieve emission reductions or a transfer efficiency equivalent to or better than HVLP spray, electrostatic spray, airless spray, or air-assisted airless spray application methods as determined according to the requirements in § 63.750(i).
              (2) All coating spray application devices used to apply primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), or specialty coatings shall be operated according to company procedures, local specified operating procedures, and/or the manufacturer's specifications, whichever is most stringent, at all times. Spray application equipment modified by the facility shall maintain a transfer efficiency equivalent to HVLP spray, electrostatic spray, airless spray, or air-assisted airless spray application techniques.
              (3) The following situations are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section:
              (i) Any situation that normally requires an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces;
              (ii) The application of coatings that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns;
              (iii) The application of coatings that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0013 centimeter (0.0005 in.) and that the permitting agency has determined cannot be applied by any of the application methods specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section;

              (iv) The use of airbrush application methods for stenciling, lettering, and other identification markings, and the spray application of no more than 3.0 fluid ounces of coating in a single application (i.e., the total volume of a single coating formulation applied during any one day to any one aerospace vehicle or component) from a hand-held device with a paint cup capacity that is equal to or less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cubic centimeters). Using multiple small paint cups or refilling a small paint cup to apply more than 3.0 fluid ounces under the requirements of this paragraph is prohibited. If a paint cup liner is used in a reusable holder or cup, then the holder or cup must be designed to hold a liner with a capacity of no more than 3.0 fluid ounces. For example, a 3.0 ounce liner cannot be used in a holder that can also be used with a 6.0 ounce liner under the requirements of this paragraph;
              (v) The use of hand-held non-refillable aerosol containers;
              (vi) Touch-up and repair operations;
              (vii) Adhesives, sealants, maskants, caulking materials, and inks; and
              (viii) The application of coatings that contain less than 20 grams of VOC per liter of coating.
              (g) Inorganic HAP emissions. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, each owner or operator of a new or existing primer, topcoat, or specialty coating application operation subject to this subpart in which any of the coatings that are spray-applied (as defined in § 63.742) and contain inorganic HAP, shall comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Apply these coatings in a booth, hangar, or portable enclosure in which air flow is directed downward onto or across the part or assembly being coated and exhausted through one or more outlets.
              (2) Control the air stream from this operation as follows:
              (i) For existing sources, the owner or operator must choose one of the following:
              (A) Before exhausting it to the atmosphere, pass the air stream through a dry particulate filter system certified using the methods described in § 63.750(o) to meet or exceed the efficiency data points in Tables 2 and 3 of this section; or

              § 63.746
              Standards: Depainting operations.
              (a) Applicability. Each owner or operator of a new or existing depainting operation subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, and with the requirements specified in paragraph (b) where there are no controls for organic HAP, or paragraph (c) where organic HAP are controlled using a control system. This section does not apply to an aerospace manufacturing or rework facility that depaints six or less completed aerospace vehicles in a calendar year.
              (1) The provisions of this section apply to the depainting of the outer surface areas of completed aerospace vehicles, including the fuselage, wings, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers of the aircraft, and the outer casing and stabilizers of missiles and rockets. These provisions do not apply to the depainting of parts or units normally removed from the aerospace vehicle for depainting. However, depainting of wings and stabilizers is always subject to the requirements of this section regardless of whether their removal is considered by the owner or operator to be normal practice for depainting.
              (2) Aerospace vehicles or components that are intended for public display, no longer operational, and not easily capable of being moved are exempt from the requirements of this section.
              (3) The following depainting operations are exempt from the requirements of this section:
              (i) Depainting of radomes; and
              (ii) Depainting of parts, subassemblies, and assemblies normally removed from the primary aircraft structure before depainting.
              (b)(1) HAP emissions—non-HAP chemical strippers and technologies. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, each owner or operator of a new or existing aerospace depainting operation subject to this subpart shall emit no organic HAP from chemical stripping formulations and agents or chemical paint softeners.
              (2) Where non-chemical based equipment is used to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, either in total or in part, each owner or operator shall operate and maintain the equipment according to the manufacturer's specifications or locally prepared operating procedures. During periods of malfunctions of such equipment, each owner or operator may use substitute materials during the repair period provided the substitute materials used are those available that minimize organic HAP emissions. In no event shall substitute materials be used for more than 15 days annually, unless such materials are organic HAP-free.
              (3) Each owner or operator of a new or existing depainting operation shall not, on an annual average basis, use more than 26 gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers or alternatively 190 pounds of organic HAP per commercial aircraft depainted; or more than 50 gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers or alternatively 365 pounds of organic HAP per military aircraft depainted for spot stripping and decal removal.
              (4) Each owner or operator of a new or existing depainting operation complying with paragraph (b)(2), that generates airborne inorganic HAP emissions from dry media blasting equipment, shall also comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(v) of this section.
              (i) Perform the depainting operation in an enclosed area, unless a closed-cycle depainting system is used.

              (ii)(A) For existing sources, pass any air stream removed from the enclosed area or closed-cycle depainting system through a dry particulate filter system, certified using the method described in § 63.750(o) to meet or exceed the efficiency data points in Tables 2 and 3 of § 63.745, through a baghouse, or through a waterwash system before exhausting it to the atmosphere.
              (B) For new sources, pass any air stream removed from the enclosed area or closed-cycle depainting system through a dry particulate filter system certified using the method described in § 63.750(o) to meet or exceed the efficiency data points in Tables 4 and 5 of § 63.745 or through a baghouse before exhausting it to the atmosphere.
              (C) Owners or operators of new sources that have commenced construction or reconstruction after June 6, 1994 but prior to October 29, 1996 may comply with the following requirements in lieu of the requirements in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section:
              (1) Pass the air stream through either a two-stage dry particulate filter system or a waterwash system before exhausting it to the atmosphere.
              (2) If the coating being removed contains chromium or cadmium, control shall consist of a HEPA filter system, three-stage filter system, or other control system equivalent to the three-stage filter system as approved by the permitting agency.
              (iii) If a dry particulate filter system is used, the following requirements shall be met:
              (A) Maintain the system in good working order;
              (B) Install a differential pressure gauge across the filter banks;
              (C) Continuously monitor the pressure drop across the filter, and read and record the pressure drop once per shift; and
              (D) Take corrective action when the pressure drop exceeds or falls below the filter manufacturer's recommended limits.
              (iv) If a waterwash system is used, continuously monitor the water flow rate, and read and record the water flow rate once per shift.
              (v) If the pressure drop, as recorded pursuant to § 63.752(e)(7), is outside the limit(s) specified by the filter manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures, whichever is more stringent, shut down the operation immediately and take corrective action. If the water path in the waterwash system fails the visual continuity/flow characteristics check, as recorded pursuant to § 63.752(e)(7), or the water flow rate, as recorded pursuant to § 63.752(d)(2), exceeds the limit(s) specified by the booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures, or the booth manufacturer's or locally prepared maintenance procedures for the filter or waterwash system have not been performed as scheduled, shut down the operation immediately and take corrective action. The operation shall not be resumed until the pressure drop or water flow rate is returned within the specified limit(s).
              (5) Mechanical and hand sanding operations are exempt from the requirements in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (c) Organic HAP emissions—organic HAP-containing chemical strippers. Each owner or operator of a new or existing organic HAP-containing chemical stripper depainting operation subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements specified in this paragraph.
              (1) All organic HAP emissions from the operation shall be reduced by the use of a control system. Each control system that was installed before the effective date shall reduce the operations' organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere by 81 percent or greater, taking into account capture and destruction or removal efficiencies.
              (2) Each control system installed on or after the effective date shall reduce organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere by 95 percent or greater. Reduction shall take into account capture and destruction or removal efficiencies, and may take into account the volume of chemical stripper used relative to baseline levels (e.g., the 95 percent efficiency may be achieved by controlling emissions at 81 percent efficiency with a control system and using 74 percent less stripper than in baseline applications). The baseline shall be calculated using data from 1996 and 1997, which shall be on a usage per aircraft or usage per square foot of surface basis.

              (3) The capture and destruction or removal efficiencies are to be determined using the procedures in § 63.750(g) when a carbon adsorber is used and those in § 63.750(h) when a control device other than a carbon adsorber is used.

Owners or operators of new affected sources subject to this subpart shall comply on the effective date or upon startup, whichever is later. In addition, each owner or operator shall comply with the compliance dates specified in § 63.6(b) and (c) as indicated in Table 1 to this subpart.
              (2) Owners or operators of existing primer, topcoat, or specialty coating application operations and depainting operations who construct or reconstruct a spray booth or hangar must comply with the new source requirements for inorganic HAP specified in §§ 63.745(g)(2)(ii) and 63.746(b)(4) for that new spray booth or hangar upon startup. Such sources must still comply with all other existing source requirements by September 1, 1998.
              (3) Each owner or operator of a specialty coating application operation or handling and storage of waste operation that begins construction or reconstruction after February 17, 2015, shall be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart on December 7, 2015, or upon startup, whichever is later. Each owner or operator of a specialty coating application operation or handling and storage of waste operation that is existing on February 17, 2015, shall be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart on or before December 7, 2018.
              (b) General. Each facility subject to this subpart shall be considered in noncompliance if the owner or operator uses a control device, other than one specified in this subpart, that has not been approved by the Administrator, as required by § 63.743(c).
              (c) Cleaning operations. Each cleaning operation subject to this subpart shall be considered in noncompliance if the owner or operator fails to institute and carry out the housekeeping measures required under § 63.744(a). Incidental emissions resulting from the activation of pressure release vents and valves on enclosed cleaning systems are exempt from this paragraph.
              (1) Hand-wipe cleaning. An affected hand-wipe cleaning operation shall be considered in compliance when all hand-wipe cleaning solvents, excluding those used for hand cleaning of spray gun equipment under § 63.744(c)(3), meet either the composition requirements specified in § 63.744(b)(1) or the vapor pressure requirement specified in § 63.744(b)(2).
              (2) Spray gun cleaning. An affected spray gun cleaning operation shall be considered in compliance when each of the following conditions is met:
              (i) One of the four techniques specified in § 63.744 (c)(1) through (c)(4) is used;
              (ii) The technique selected is operated according to the procedures specified in § 63.744 (c)(1) through (c)(4) as appropriate; and
              (iii) If an enclosed system is used, monthly visual inspections are conducted and any leak detected is repaired within 15 days after detection.

              (3) Flush cleaning. An affected flush cleaning operation shall be considered in compliance if the operating requirements specified in § 63.744(d) are implemented and carried out.
              (d) Organic HAP and VOC content levels—primer, topcoat, and specialty coating application operations—(1) Performance test periods. For uncontrolled coatings that are not averaged, each 24 hours is considered a performance test. For compliant and non-compliant coatings that are averaged together, each 30-day period is considered a performance test, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program. When using a control device other than a carbon adsorber, three 1-hour runs constitute the test period for the initial and any subsequent performance test. When using a carbon adsorber, each rolling material balance period is considered a performance test.
              (2) Initial performance tests. If a control device is used, each owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the overall reduction efficiency specified in paragraph § 63.745, unless a waiver is obtained under either § 63.7(e)(2)(iv) or § 63.7(h). The initial performance test shall be conducted according to the procedures and test methods specified in §§ 63.7 and 63.750(g) for carbon adsorbers and in § 63.750(h) for control devices other than carbon adsorbers. For carbon adsorbers, the initial performance test shall be used to establish the appropriate rolling material balance period for determining compliance. The procedures in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(vi) of this section shall be used in determining initial compliance with the provisions of this subpart for carbon adsorbers.
              (i)(A) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual carbon adsorber vessels pursuant to § 63.750(g) (2) or (4), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all of the individual carbon adsorber vessels.
              (B) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel pursuant to § 63.750(g) (3) or (4), each carbon adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each carbon adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.

              (3) The primer application operation is considered in compliance when the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iv) of this section, as applicable, and in paragraph (e) of this section are met. Failure to meet any one of the conditions identified in these paragraphs shall constitute noncompliance. The compliance demonstration for a primer may be based on the organic HAP content or the VOC content of the primer; demonstrating compliance with both the HAP content limit and the VOC content limit is not required. If a primer contains HAP solvents that are exempt from the definition of VOC in § 63.741 and 40 CFR 51.100, then the HAP content must be used to demonstrate compliance.
              (i) For all uncontrolled primers, all values of Hi and Ha (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(c) and (d)) are less than or equal to the applicable HAP content limit in § 63.745(c)(1), and all values of Gi and Ga (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(e) and (f)) are less than or equal to the applicable VOC content limit in § 63.745(c)(2).

              (B) Uses an alternative application technique, as allowed under § 63.745(f)(1)(ix), such that the emissions of both organic HAP and VOC for the implementation period of the alternative application method are less than or equal to the emissions generated using HVLP or electrostatic spray application methods as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(i).
              (iv) Operates all application techniques in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications or locally prepared operating procedures, whichever is more stringent.
              (4) The topcoat or specialty coating application operation is considered in compliance when the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iv) of this section, as applicable, and in paragraph (e) of this section are met. Failure to meet any of the conditions identified in these paragraphs shall constitute noncompliance.
              (i) The topcoat application operation is considered in compliance when the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section are met. The specialty coating application operation is considered in compliance when the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) are met. The compliance demonstration for a topcoat or a specialty coating may be based on the organic HAP content or the VOC content of the coating; demonstrating compliance with both the HAP content limit and the VOC content limit is not required. If a topcoat or specialty coating contains HAP solvents that are exempt from the definition of VOC in § 63.741 and 40 CFR 51.100, then the HAP content must be used to demonstrate compliance.
              (A) For all uncontrolled topcoats, all values of Hi and Ha (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(c) and (d)) are less than or equal to the applicable HAP content limit in § 63.745(c)(3), and all values of Gi and Ga (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(e) and (f)) are less than or equal to the applicable VOC content limit in § 63.745(c)(4).

              (B) For all uncontrolled specialty coatings, all values of Hi and Ha (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(c) and (d)) are less than or equal to the HAP content limits specified in Table 1 to § 63.745 for the applicable specialty coating types (less water) as applied, and all values of Gi and Ga (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(e) and (f)) are less than or equal to the VOC content limits specified in Table 1 to § 63.745 for the applicable specialty coating types (less water and exempt solvents) as applied.
              (ii) If a control device is used,
              (A) The overall control system efficiency, Ek, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g) for control systems containing carbon adsorbers and in § 63.750(h) for control systems with other control devices, is equal to or greater than 81% during the initial performance test and any subsequent performance test;
              (B) If an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the average combustion temperature for all 3-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average combustion temperature established under § 63.751(b)(11); and
              (C) If a catalytic incinerator is used, the average combustion temperatures for all 3-hour periods are greater than or equal to the average combustion temperatures established under § 63.751(b)(12).
              (iii)(A) Uses an application technique specified in § 63.745(f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iv); or
              (B) Uses an alternative application technique, as allowed under § 63.745(f)(1)(v), such that the emissions of both organic HAP and VOC for the implementation period of the alternative application method are less than or equal to the emissions generated using HVLP spray, electrostatic spray, airless spray, or air-assisted airless spray application methods, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(i).
              (iv) Operates all application techniques in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications or locally prepared operating procedures.
              (e) Inorganic HAP emissions—primer, topcoat, and specialty coating application operations. For each primer, topcoat, or specialty coating application operation that emits inorganic HAP, the operation is in compliance when:

              (1) It is operated according to the requirements specified in § 63.745(g)(1) through (g)(3); and
              
              (2) It is shut down immediately whenever the pressure drop or water flow rate is outside the limit(s) established for them and is not restarted until the pressure drop or water flow rate is returned within these limit(s), as required under § 63.745(g)(3).
              (f) Organic HAP emissions—Depainting operations—(1) Performance test periods. When using a control device other than a carbon adsorber, three 1-hour runs constitute the test period for the initial and any subsequent performance test. When a carbon adsorber is used, each rolling material balance period is considered a performance test. Each 24-hour period is considered a performance test period for determining compliance with § 63.746(b)(1). For uncontrolled organic emissions from depainting operations, each calendar year is considered a performance test period for determining compliance with the HAP limits for organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used for spot stripping and decal removal.
              (2) Initial performance tests. If a control device is used, each owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the overall reduction efficiency specified in § 63.746(c), unless a waiver is obtained under either § 63.7(e)(2)(iv) or § 63.7(h).

              (i) If a carbon adsorber (or other control device) is used, the overall control efficiency of the control system, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (or other control device as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(h)), is equal to or greater than 81% for control systems installed before the effective date, or equal to or greater than 95% for control systems installed on or after the effective date, during the initial performance test and all subsequent material balances (or performance tests, as appropriate).
              (ii) For non-HAP depainting operations complying with § 63.746(b)(1);

              (A) For any spot stripping and decal removal, the value of C, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(j), is less than or equal to 26 gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper or 190 pounds of organic HAP per commercial aircraft depainted calculated on a yearly average; and is less than or equal to 50 gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper or 365 pounds of organic HAP per military aircraft depainted calculated on a yearly average; and
              (B) The requirements of § 63.746(b)(2) are carried out during malfunctions of non-chemical based equipment.
              (g) Inorganic HAP emissions—depainting operations. Each depainting operation is in compliance when:

              (2) It is shut down immediately whenever the pressure drop or water flow rate is outside the limit(s) established for them and is not restarted until the pressure drop or water flow rate is returned within these limit(s), as required under § 63.746(b)(4)(v).
              (h) Chemical milling maskant application operations—(1) Performance test periods. For uncontrolled chemical milling maskants that are not averaged, each 24-hour period is considered a performance test. For compliant and noncompliant chemical milling maskants that are averaged together, each 30-day period is considered a performance test, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program. When using a control device other than a carbon adsorber, three 1-hour runs constitute the test period for the initial and any subsequent performance test. When a carbon adsorber is used, each rolling material balance period is considered a performance test.
              (2) Initial performance tests. If a control device is used, each owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the overall reduction efficiency specified in § 63.747(d), unless a waiver is obtained under either § 63.7(e)(2)(iv) or § 63.7(h). The initial performance test shall be conducted according to the procedures and test methods specified in § 63.7 and § 63.750(g) for carbon adsorbers and in § 63.750(h) for control devices other than carbon adsorbers. For carbon adsorbers, the initial performance test shall be used to establish the appropriate rolling material balance period for determining compliance. The procedures in paragraphs (h)(2) (i) through (vi) of this section shall be used in determining initial compliance with the provisions of this subpart for carbon adsorbers.
              (i)(A) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual carbon adsorber vessels pursuant to § 63.750(g) (2) or (4), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all of the individual carbon adsorber vessels.
              (B) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel pursuant to § 63.750(g) (3) or (4), each carbon adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each carbon adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
              (ii) EPA Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of part 60 is used for sample and velocity traverses.
              (iii) EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60 is used for velocity and volumetric flow rates.
              (iv) EPA Method 3 of appendix A of part 60 is used for gas analysis.
              (v) EPA Method 4 of appendix A of part 60 is used for stack gas moisture.
              (vi) EPA Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test period.

              (3) The chemical milling maskant application operation is considered in compliance when the conditions specified in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section are met. The compliance demonstration for a chemical milling maskant may be based on the organic HAP content or the VOC content of the chemical milling maskant; demonstrating compliance with both the HAP content limit and the VOC content limit is not required. If a chemical milling maskant contains HAP solvents that are exempt from the definition of VOC in § 63.741 and 40 CFR 51.100, then the HAP content must be used to demonstrate compliance.
              

              (i) For all uncontrolled chemical milling maskants, all values of Hi and Ha (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750 (k) and (l)) are less than or equal to 622 grams of organic HAP per liter (5.2 lb/gal) of Type I chemical milling maskant as applied (less water), and 160 grams of organic HAP per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of Type II chemical milling maskant as applied (less water). All values of Gi and Ga (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750 (m) and (n)) are less than or equal to 622 grams of VOC per liter (5.2 lb/gal) of Type I chemical milling maskant as applied (less water and exempt solvents), and 160 grams of VOC per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of Type II chemical milling maskant (less water and exempt solvents) as applied.
              (ii) If a carbon adsorber (or other control device) is used, the overall control efficiency of the control system, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (or systems with other control devices as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(h)), is equal to or greater than 81% during the initial performance test period and all subsequent material balances (or performance tests, as appropriate).
              (i) Handling and storage of waste. For those wastes subject to this subpart, failure to comply with the requirements specified in § 63.748 shall be considered a violation.
              (j) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.

              § 63.750
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Composition determination. Compliance with the hand-wipe cleaning solvent approved composition list specified in § 63.744(b)(1) for hand-wipe cleaning solvents shall be demonstrated using data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent. The data shall identify all components of the cleaning solvent and shall demonstrate that one of the approved composition definitions is met.
              (b) Vapor pressure determination. The composite vapor pressure of hand-wipe cleaning solvents used in a cleaning operation subject to this subpart shall be determined as follows:
              (1) For single-component hand-wipe cleaning solvents, the vapor pressure shall be determined using MSDS or other manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods.
              (2) The composite vapor pressure of a blended hand-wipe solvent shall be determined by quantifying the amount of each organic compound in the blend using manufacturer's supplied data or a gas chromatographic analysis in accordance with ASTM E 260-91 or 96 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14 of subpart A of this part) and by calculating the composite vapor pressure of the solvent by summing the partial pressures of each component. The vapor pressure of each component shall be determined using manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods. The following equation shall be used to determine the composite vapor pressure:
              
                ER01SE98.000
              
              
                where:
                
                Wi = Weight of the “i”th VOC compound, grams.
                Ww = Weight of water, grams.
                
                We = Weight of non-HAP, nonVOC compound, grams.
                MWi = Molecular weight of the “i”th VOC compound, g/g-mole.
                MWw = Molecular weight of water, g/g-mole.
                MWe = Molecular weight of exempt compound, g/g-mole.
                PPc = VOC composite partial pressure at 20 °C, mm Hg.
                VPi = Vapor pressure of the “i”th VOC compound at 20 °C, mm Hg.
              
              
              (c) Organic HAP content level determination—compliant primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings. For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings complying with the primer, topcoat, or specialty coating organic HAP content limits specified in § 63.745(c) without being averaged, the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section shall be used to determine the mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water) as applied. As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, an owner or operator may use the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate that organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water), as applied, is less than or equal to the applicable organic HAP limit specified in § 63.745(c). Owners and operators that use the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance based on the HAP content of the coating may add non-HAP solvent to those coatings provided that the owner or operator also maintains records of the non-HAP solvent added to the coating.
              (1) For coatings that contain no exempt solvents, determine the total organic HAP content using manufacturer's supplied data or Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine the VOC content. The VOC content shall be used as a surrogate for total HAP content for coatings that contain no exempt solvent. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 24 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 24 analysis.
              When Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content of water-reducible coatings, the precision adjustment factors in Reference Method 24 shall be used. If the adjusted analytical VOC content is less than the formulation solvent content, then the analytical VOC content should be set equal to the formulation solvent content.
              (2) For each coating formulation as applied, determine the organic HAP weight fraction, water weight fraction (if applicable), and density from manufacturer's data. If the value for organic HAP weight fraction cannot be determined using the manufacturer's data, the owner or operator shall use Method 311 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or submit an alternative procedure for determining the value for approval by the Administrator. If the values for water weight fraction (if applicable) and density cannot be determined using the manufacturer's data, the owner or operator shall submit an alternative procedure for determining their values for approval by the Administrator. Recalculation is required only when a change occurs in the coating formulation. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 311 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 311 analysis.
              (3) For each coating as applied, calculate the mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (lb/gal) less water as applied using equations 1, 2, and 3:
              
                ER01SE95.004
              
              
                where:
                
                Vwi = volume (gal) of water in one gal of coating i.
                Dci = density (lb of coating per gal of coating) of coating i.
                Wwi = weight fraction (expressed as a decimal) of water in coating i.
                Dw = density of water, 8.33 lb/gal.
              
              
                ER01SE95.005
              
              
                where:
                
                MHi = mass (lb) of organic HAP in one gal of coating i.
                Dci = density (lb of coating per gal of coating) of coating i.
                WHi = weight fraction (expressed as a decimal) of organic HAP in coating i.
              
              
                ER01SE95.006
              
              
                where:
                
                
                Hi = mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating i (lb/gal) less water as applied.
                MHi = mass (lb) of organic HAP in one gal of coating i.
                Vwi = volume (gal) of water in one gal of coating i.
              
              
              (d) Organic HAP content level determination—averaged primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings. For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that are averaged together in order to comply with the primer, topcoat, and specialty coating organic HAP content limits specified in § 63.745(c), the following procedure shall be used to determine the monthly volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water) as applied, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
              (1)(i) Determine the total organic HAP weight fraction as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvent, are added to a coating prior to its application, the organic HAP weight fraction of the coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients have been added.
              (ii) Determine the total organic HAP weight fraction of each coating as applied each month.
              (A) If no changes have been made to a coating, either as supplied or as applied, or if a change has been made that has a minimal effect on the organic HAP content of the coating, the value previously determined may continue to be used until a change in formulation has been made by either the manufacturer or the user.
              (B) If a change in formulation or a change in the ingredients added to the coating takes place, including the ratio of coating to diluent solvent, prior to its application, either of which results in a more than minimal effect on the organic HAP content of the coating, the total organic HAP weight fraction of the coating shall be redetermined.
              (iii) Manufacturer's formulation data may be used to determine the total organic HAP content of each coating and any ingredients added to the coating prior to its application. If the total organic HAP content cannot be determined using the manufacturer's data, the owner or operator shall use Method 311 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A for determining the total organic HAP weight fraction, or shall submit an alternative procedure for determining the total organic HAP weight fraction for approval by the Administrator. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 311 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 311 analysis.
              (2)(i) Determine the volume both in total gallons as applied and in total gallons (less water) as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvents, are added prior to its application, the volume of each coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients (including any diluent solvent) have been added.
              (ii) Determine the volume of each coating (less water) as applied each month, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
              (iii) The volume applied may be determined from company records.
              (3)(i) Determine the density of each coating as applied. If any ingredients, including diluent solvent, are added to a coating prior to its application, the density of the coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients have been added.
              (ii) Determine the density of each coating as applied each month, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
              (A) If no changes have been made to a coating, either as supplied or as applied, or if a change has been made that has a minimal effect on the density of the coating, then the value previously determined may continue to be used until a change in formulation has been made by either the manufacturer or the user.

              (B) If a change in formulation or a change in the ingredients added to the coating takes place, including the ratio of coating to diluent solvent, prior to its application, either of which results in a more than minimal effect on the density of the coating, then the density of the coating shall be redetermined.
              
              (iii) The density may be determined from company records, including manufacturer's data sheets. If the density of the coating cannot be determined using the company's records, including the manufacturer's data, then the owner or operator shall submit an alternative procedure for determining the density for approval by the Administrator.
              (4) Calculate the total volume in gallons as applied (less water) by summing the individual volumes of each coating (less water) as applied, which were determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
              (5) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP in coatings emitted per unit volume (lb/gal) of coating (less water) as applied during each 30-day period using equation 4:
              
                ER01SE95.007
              
              
                where:
                
                Ha = volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of coating (lb/gal) (less water) as applied during each 30-day period for those coatings being averaged.
                n = number of coatings being averaged.
                WHi = weight fraction (expressed as a decimal) of organic HAP in coating i as applied that is being averaged during each 30-day period.
                Dci = density (lb of coating per gal of coating) of coating i as applied that is being averaged during each 30-day period.
                Vci = volume (gal) of coating i as applied that is being averaged during the 30-day period.
                Clw = total volume (gal) of all coatings (less water) as applied that are being averaged during each 30-day period.
              
              
              (e) VOC content level determination—compliant primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings. For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings complying with the primer, topcoat, and specialty coating VOC content levels specified in § 63.745(c) without being averaged, the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section shall be used to determine the mass of VOC emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied. As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section, an owner or operator may use coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate that VOC emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents), as applied, is less than or equal to the applicable VOC limit specified in § 63.745(c).
              (1) Determine the VOC content of each formulation (less water and exempt solvents) as applied using manufacturer's supplied data or Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine the VOC content. The VOC content shall be used as a surrogate for total HAP content for coatings that contain no exempt solvent. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 24 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 24 analysis.
              When Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content of water-reducible coatings, the precision adjustment factors in Reference Method 24 shall be used. If the adjusted analytical VOC content is less than the formulation solvent content, then the analytical VOC content should be set equal to the formulation solvent content.
              (2) For each coating applied, calculate the mass of VOC emitted per volume of coating (lb/gal) (less water and exempt solvents) as applied using equations 5, 6, and 7:
              
                ER01SE95.008
              
              
                where:
                
                Vwi = volume (gal) of water in one gal of coating i.
                Dci = density (lb of coating per gal of coating) of coating i.

                Dw = density of water, 8.33 lb/gal.
              
              
                ER01SE95.009
              
              
                where:
                
                MVi = mass (lb) of VOC in one gal of coating i.
                Dci = density (lb of coating per gal of coating) of coating i.
                WVi = weight fraction (expressed as a decimal) of VOC in coating i.
              
              
                
                ER27MR98.002

              (3)(i) If the VOC content is found to be different when EPA Method 24 is used during an enforcement inspection from that used by the owner or operator in calculating Ga, compliance shall be based, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, upon the VOC content obtained using EPA Method 24.

              (ii) If the VOC content of a coating obtained using Method 24 would indicate noncompliance as determined under either § 63.749 (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i), an owner or operator may elect to average the coating with other uncontrolled coatings and (re)calculate Gi (using the procedure specified in paragraph (f) of this section), provided appropriate and sufficient records were maintained for all coatings included in the average (re)calculation. The (re)calculated value of Gi (Ga in paragraph (f)) for the averaged coatings shall then be used to determine compliance.
              (f) VOC content level determination—averaged primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings. For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that are averaged within their respective coating category in order to comply with the primer, topcoat, and specialty coating VOC content limits specified in § 63.745(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(6), the following procedure shall be used to determine the monthly volume-weighted average mass of VOC emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
              (1)(i) Determine the VOC content (lb/gal) as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvent, are added to a coating prior to its application, the VOC content of the coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients have been added.
              (ii) Determine the VOC content of each coating as applied each month, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
              (A) If no changes have been made to a coating, either as supplied or as applied, or if a change has been made that has a minimal effect on the VOC content of the coating, the value previously determined may continue to be used until a change in formulation has been made by either the manufacturer or the user.
              (B) If a change in formulation or a change in the ingredients added to the coating takes place, including the ratio of coating to diluent solvent, prior to its application, either of which results in a more than minimal effect on the VOC content of the coating, the VOC content of the coating shall be redetermined.
              (iii) Determine the VOC content of each primer, topcoat, and specialty coating formulation (less water and exempt solvents) as applied using EPA Method 24 or from manufacturer's data.
              (2)(i) Determine the volume both in total gallons as applied and in total gallons (less water and exempt solvents) as applied of each coating.

                ER01SE95.011
              
              
                where:
                
                Ga = volume weighted average mass of VOC per unit volume of coating (lb/gal) (less water and exempt solvents) as applied during each 30-day period for those coatings being averaged.
                n = number of coatings being averaged.
                (VOC)ci = VOC content (lb/gal) of coating i (less water and exempt solvents) as applied (as determined using the procedures specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) that is being averaged during the 30-day period.
                Vci = volume (gal) of coating i (less water and exempt solvents) as applied that is being averaged during the 30-day period.
                Clwes = total volume (gal) of all coatings (less water and exempt solvents) as applied during each 30-day period for those coatings being averaged.
              
              

              (5)(i) If the VOC content is found to be different when EPA Method 24 is used during an enforcement inspection from that used by the owner or operator in calculating Ga, recalculation of Ga is required using the new value. If more than one coating is involved, the recalculation shall be made once using all of the new values.

              (ii) If recalculation is required, an owner or operator may elect to include in the recalculation of Ga uncontrolled coatings that were not previously included provided appropriate and sufficient records were maintained for these other coatings to allow daily recalculations.
              (iii) The recalculated value of Ga under either paragraph (f)(5)(i) or (f)(5)(ii) of this section shall be used to determine compliance.
              (g) Overall VOC and/or organic HAP control efficiency—carbon adsorber.

Results of the material balance calculations performed to demonstrate initial compliance shall be submitted to the Administrator with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.9(h) and by § 63.753 (c)(1)(iv), (d)(3)(i), and (e)(3). When demonstrating compliance by this procedure, § 63.7(e)(3) of subpart A does not apply. The amount of liquid HAP or VOC applied and recovered shall be determined as discussed in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section. The overall HAP or VOC emission reduction (R) is calculated using equation 9:

                ER01SE95.013
              
              (vi) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E) × (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiencies required under § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
              (3) To demonstrate compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) when affected HAP emission points are controlled by a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel, each owner or operator of an affected source shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:
              (i) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that each volumetric flow rate and the total HAP emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (9) through (14);

              (ii) Assure that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are segregated from gaseous emission points not affected by this subpart and that the emissions can be captured for measurement, as described in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section;

              (v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system (Hsys) by computing the average efficiency of the individual carbon adsorber vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Qhv) of each individual carbon adsorber vessel (v) using equation 13:
              
                ER01SE95.015
              
              (vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the capture system using equation 11.

              (vii) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (Hsys) × (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
              (4) An alternative method of demonstrating compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) is the installation of a total enclosure around the affected HAP emission point(s) and the ventilation of all HAP emissions from the total enclosure to a control device with the efficiency specified in paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section. If this method is selected, the compliance test methods described in paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), and (g)(3) of this section are not required. Instead, each owner or operator of an affected source shall:
              (i) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. An enclosure that meets the requirements in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section shall be considered a total enclosure. The owner or operator of an enclosure that does not meet these requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are contained and vented to the control device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
              (A) The total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5% of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;
              (B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;
              (C) The average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft openings shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:

              (2) Determine FV by equation 14:
              
                ER01SE95.016
              

              (D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without verification.
              
              (ii) Determine the control device efficiency using equation 10 or equations 12 and 13, as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (9) through (14).

              (5) When nonregenerative carbon adsorbers are used to comply with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d), the owner or operator may conduct a design evaluation to demonstrate initial compliance in lieu of following the compliance test procedures of paragraphs (g)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section. The design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, component concentrations, flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and the emission point operating schedule.
              (6)(i) To demonstrate initial compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) when hard piping or ductwork is used to direct VOC and HAP emissions from a VOC and HAP source to the control device, each owner or operator shall demonstrate upon inspection that the criteria of paragraph (g)(6)(i)(A) and paragraph (g)(6)(i) (B) or (C) of this section VR/FD are met.
              (A) The equipment shall be vented to a control device.
              (B) The control device efficiency (E or Hsys, as applicable) determined using equation 10 or equations 12 and 13, respectively, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (9) through (14), shall be equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
              (C) When a nonregenerative carbon adsorber is used, the ductwork from the affected emission point(s) shall be vented to the control device and the carbon adsorber shall be demonstrated, through the procedures of § 63.750(g) (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), to meet the requirements of § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
              (7) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source category. Emissions from these activities are to be included when determining if the standards specified in § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) are being attained.
              (8) An owner or operator who uses compliance techniques other than those specified in this subpart shall submit a description of those compliance procedures, subject to the Administrator's approval, in accordance with § 63.7(f) of subpart A.

              (i) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual carbon adsorber vessels pursuant to paragraph (g) (2) or (4) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all of the individual carbon adsorber vessels.

              (ii) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel pursuant to § 63.750(g) (3) or (4), each carbon adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each carbon adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.

              (A) The destruction or removal efficiency test shall consist of three runs. The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time such as 15-minute intervals during the run.

              (k) Organic HAP content level determination—compliant chemical milling maskants. For those uncontrolled chemical milling maskants complying with the chemical milling maskant organic HAP content limit specified in § 63.747(c)(1) without being averaged, the procedure in paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall be used to determine the mass of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of coating (chemical milling maskant) i as applied (less water), Hi (lb/gal). As an alternative to the procedures in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may use coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate that organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water), as applied, is less than or equal to the applicable organic HAP limit specified in § 63.747(c). Owners and operators that use the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance based on the HAP content of the coating may add non-HAP solvent to those coatings provided that the owner or operator also maintains records of the non-HAP solvent added to the coating.
              (1) For coatings that contain no exempt solvents, determine the total organic HAP content using manufacturer's supplied data or Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to determine the VOC content. The VOC content shall be used as a surrogate for total HAP content for coatings that contain no exempt solvent. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 24 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 24 analysis.
              When Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content of water-reducible coatings, the precision adjustment factors in Reference Method 24 shall be used. If the adjusted analytical VOC content is less than the formulation solvent content, then the analytical VOC content should be set equal to the formulation solvent content.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (l) Organic HAP content level determination—averaged chemical milling maskants. For those uncontrolled chemical milling maskants that are averaged together in order to comply with the chemical milling maskant organic HAP content level specified in § 63.747(c)(1), the procedure specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section shall be used to determine the monthly volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.

If more than one chemical milling maskant is involved, the recalculation shall be made once using all of the new values.

              (ii) If recalculation is required, an owner or operator may elect to include in the recalculation of Ga uncontrolled chemical milling maskants that were not previously included provided appropriate and sufficient records were maintained for these other chemical milling maskants to allow daily recalculations.

                Epoxy polyamide topcoat—A coating used where harder films are required or in some areas where engraving is accomplished in camouflage colors.
              
                Fire-resistant (interior) coating—For civilian aircraft, fire-resistant interior coatings are used on passenger cabin interior parts that are subject to the FAA fireworthiness requirements. For military aircraft, fire-resistant interior coatings are used on parts subject to the flammability requirements of MIL-STD-1630A and MIL-A-87721. For space applications, these coatings are used on parts subject to the flammability requirements of SE-R-0006 and SSP 30233.
              
                Flexible primer—A primer that meets flexibility requirements such as those needed for adhesive bond primed fastener heads or on surfaces expected to contain fuel. The flexible coating is required because it provides a compatible, flexible substrate over bonded sheet rubber and rubber-type coatings as well as a flexible bridge between the fasteners, skin, and skin-to-skin joints on outer aircraft skins. This flexible bridge allows more topcoat flexibility around fasteners and decreases the chance of the topcoat cracking around the fasteners. The result is better corrosion resistance.

            Subpart HH—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities
            
              Source:
              64 FR 32628, June 17, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 63.760
              Applicability and designation of affected source.
              (a) This subpart applies to the owners and operators of the emission points, specified in paragraph (b) of this section that are located at oil and natural gas production facilities that meet the specified criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
              (1) Facilities that are major or area sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) as defined in § 63.761. Emissions for major source determination purposes can be estimated using the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, calculated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use the facility's design maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput to estimate the maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with § 63.10(b)(3). A facility that is determined to be an area source, but subsequently increases its emissions or its potential to emit above the major source levels, and becomes a major source, must comply thereafter with all provisions of this subpart applicable to a major source starting on the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.

              (i) If the owner or operator documents, to the Administrator's satisfaction, a decline in annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, each year for the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput used to determine maximum potential emissions according to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. In all other circumstances, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum throughput used to determine whether a facility is a major source in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
              (A) The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the average of the annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput for the 3 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.
              (B) The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the highest annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput over the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual facility natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput each year and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput increases above the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied by a factor of 1.2.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for other parameters used to calculate emissions as the maximum for the period over which the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Parameters, other than glycol circulation rate, shall be based on either highest measured values or annual average. For estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol dehydration units, the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation shall be the unit's maximum rate under its physical and operational design consistent with the definition of potential to emit in § 63.2.
              (2) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store hydrocarbon liquids.
              (3) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store natural gas prior to the point at which natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category or is delivered to a final end user. For the purposes of this subpart, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the natural gas processing plant, when present. If no natural gas processing plant is present, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the point of custody transfer.
              (b) The affected sources for major sources are listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for area sources in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (1) For major sources, the affected source shall comprise each emission point located at a facility that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section and listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section.

              (b)-(c) [Reserved]

              (d) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed; however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense, the affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              
              (1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (i) The violation:
              (A) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
              (B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (D) Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
              (iv) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (vii) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (2) Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.

              (2) If no control device is used to comply with the emission limit in § 63.765(b)(1)(iii), the owner or operator must determine the glycol dehydration unit BTEX emissions as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. Compliance is demonstrated if the BTEX emissions determined as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) are less than the emission limit calculated using the equation in § 63.765(b)(1)(iii).
              (i) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites at the outlet of the glycol dehydration unit process vent. Any references to particulate mentioned in Methods 1 and 1A do not apply to this section.

For inlet gas flowrate, compliance with the operating parameter limit is achieved when the value is equal to or less than the value established under § 63.772(h) or under the performance test conducted under § 63.772(e), as applicable.
              (4) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments), the CMS required in § 63.773(d) must be operated at all times the affected source is operating. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Monitoring system repairs are required to be completed in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
              (5) Data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities may not be used in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. All the data collected during all other required data collection periods must be used in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
              (6) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required quality monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments), failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.
              (g) Compliance demonstration with percent reduction or emission limit performance requirements—condensers. This paragraph applies to the demonstration of compliance with the performance requirements specified in § 63.771(d)(1)(ii), (e)(3), or (f)(1) for condensers.

              (a) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in HAP emissions from that source achieved under the applicable requirements in §§ 63.764 through 63.771, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement. The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (c) Any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information demonstrating that the alternative achieves equivalent emission reductions.

              § 63.780
              Relationship of subpart II to subpart A of this part.
              Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to owners and operators of sources subject to the provisions of this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.781
              Applicability.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to shipbuilding and ship repair operations at any facility that is a major source.
              (b) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings used in volumes of less than 200 liters (52.8 gallons) per year, provided the total volume of coating exempt under this paragraph does not exceed 1,000 liters per year (264 gallons per year) at any facility. Coatings exempt under this paragraph shall be clearly labeled as “low-usage exempt,” and the volume of each such coating applied shall be maintained in the facility's records.
              (c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings applied with hand-held, nonrefillable, aerosol containers or to unsaturated polyester resin (i.e., fiberglass lay-up) coatings. Coatings applied to suitably prepared fiberglass surfaces for protective or decorative purposes are subject to this subpart.
              (d) If you are authorized in accordance with 40 CFR 63.783(c) to use an add-on control system as an alternative means of limiting emissions from coating operations, in response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available in response to claims for injunctive relief.
              (1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (i) The excess emissions:
              (A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
              (B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and

              (C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              
              (D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
              (iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; and
              (v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health; and
              (vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (2) Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

              § 63.783
              Standards.
              (a) No owner or operator of any existing or new affected source shall cause or allow the application of any coating to a ship with an as-applied VOHAP content exceeding the applicable limit given in Table 2 of this subpart, as determined by the procedures described in § 63.785 (c)(1) through (c)(4). For the compliance procedures described in § 63.785 (c)(1) through (c)(3), VOC shall be used as a surrogate for VOHAP, and Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used as the definitive measure for determining compliance. For the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(4), an alternative test method capable of measuring independent VOHAP shall be used to determine compliance. The method must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
              (b) Each owner or operator of a new or existing affected source shall ensure that:

              (1) At all times the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (2) All handling and transfer of VOHAP-containing materials to and from containers, tanks, vats, drums, and piping systems is conducted in a manner that minimizes spills.
              (3) All containers, tanks, vats, drums, and piping systems are free of cracks, holes, and other defects and remain closed unless materials are being added to or removed from them.
              (c) Approval of alternative means of limiting emissions. (1) The owner or operator of an affected source may apply to the Administrator for permission to use an alternative means (such as an add-on control system) of limiting emissions from coating operations. The application must include:
              (i) An engineering material balance evaluation that provides a comparison of the emissions that would be achieved using the alternative means to those that would result from using coatings that comply with the limits in Table 2 of this subpart, or the results from an emission test that accurately measures the capture efficiency and control device efficiency achieved by the control system and the composition of the associated coatings so that the emissions comparison can be made;
              (ii) A proposed monitoring protocol that includes operating parameter values to be monitored for compliance and an explanation of how the operating parameter values will be established through a performance test; and
              (iii) Details of appropriate recordkeeping and reporting procedures.
              (2) The Administrator shall approve the alternative means of limiting emissions if, in the Administrator's judgment, postcontrol emissions of VOHAP per volume applied solids will be no greater than those from the use of coatings that comply with the limits in Table 2 of this subpart.
              (3) The Administrator may condition approval on operation, maintenance, and monitoring requirements to ensure that emissions from the source are no greater than those that would otherwise result from this subpart.

              § 63.785
              Compliance procedures.
              (a) For each batch of coating that is received by an affected source, the owner or operator shall (see Figure 1 of this section for a flow diagram of the compliance procedures):
              (1) Determine the coating category and the applicable VOHAP limit as specified in § 63.783(a).
              (2) Certify the as-supplied VOC content of the batch of coating. The owner or operator may use a certification supplied by the manufacturer for the batch, although the owner or operator retains liability should subsequent testing reveal a violation. If the owner or operator performs the certification testing, only one of the containers in which the batch of coating was received is required to be tested.
              (b)(1) In lieu of testing each batch of coating, as applied, the owner or operator may determine compliance with the VOHAP limits using any combination of the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. The procedure used for each coating shall be determined and documented prior to application.

              (2) The results of any compliance demonstration conducted by the affected source or any regulatory agency using Method 24 shall take precedence over the results using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(3) of this section.
              (3) The results of any compliance demonstration conducted by the affected source or any regulatory agency using an approved test method to determine VOHAP content shall take precedence over the results using the procedures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              (c)(1) Coatings to which thinning solvent will not be added. For coatings to which thinning solvent (or any other material) will not be added under any circumstance or to which only water is added, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply as follows:
              (i) Certify the as-applied VOC content of each batch of coating.
              (ii) Notify the persons responsible for applying the coating that no thinning solvent may be added to the coating by affixing a label to each container of coating in the batch or through another means described in the implementation plan required in § 63.787(b).
              (iii) If the certified as-applied VOC content of each batch of coating used during a calendar month is less than or equal to the applicable VOHAP limit in § 63.783(a) (either in terms of g/L of coating or g/L of solids), then compliance is demonstrated for that calendar month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
              (2) Coatings to which thinning solvent will be added—coating-by-coating compliance. For a coating to which thinning solvent is routinely or sometimes added, the owner or operator shall comply as follows:
              (i) Prior to the first application of each batch, designate a single thinner for the coating and calculate the maximum allowable thinning ratio (or ratios, if the affected source complies with the cold-weather limits in addition to the other limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart) for each batch as follows:
              
                ER15DE95.191
              
              
                where:
                
                R = Maximum allowable thinning ratio for a given batch (L thinner/L coating as supplied);
                Vs = Volume fraction of solids in the batch as supplied (L solids/L coating as supplied);
                VOHAP limit = Maximum allowable as-applied VOHAP content of the coating (g VOHAP/L solids);
                mVOC = VOC content of the batch as supplied [g VOC (including cure volatiles and exempt compounds on the HAP list)/L coating (including water and exempt compounds) as supplied];
                Dth = Density of the thinner (g/L).
              
              
              If Vs is not supplied directly by the coating manufacturer, the owner or operator shall determine Vs as follows:
              
                ER15DE95.192
              
              
                where:
                
                mvolatiles = Total volatiles in the batch, including VOC, water, and exempt compounds (g/L coating); and
                Davg = Average density of volatiles in the batch (g/L).
              
              
              The procedures specified in § 63.786(d) may be used to determine the values of variables defined in this paragraph. In addition, the owner or operator may choose to construct nomographs, based on Equation 1 of this subpart, similar or identical to the one provided in appendix B of this subpart as a means of easily estimating the maximum allowable thinning ratio.
              (ii) Prior to the first application of each batch, notify painters and other persons, as necessary, of the designated thinner and maximum allowable thinning ratio(s) for each batch of the coating by affixing a label to each container of coating or through another means described in the implementation plan required in § 63.787(b).
              (iii) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the volume of each batch of the coating used, as supplied, during the previous month.
              (iv) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the total allowable volume of thinner for the coating used during the previous month as follows:
              
                
                ER15DE95.193
              
              
                where:
                
                Vth = Total allowable volume of thinner for the previous month (L thinner);
                Vb = Volume of each batch, as supplied and before being thinned, used during non-cold-weather days of the previous month (L coating as supplied);
                Rcold = Maximum allowable thinning ratio for each batch used during cold-weather days (L thinner/L coating as supplied);
                Vb-cold = Volume of each batch, as supplied and before being thinned, used during cold-weather days of the previous month (L coating as supplied);
                i = Each batch of coating; and
                n = Total number of batches of the coating.
              
              
              (v) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the volume of thinner actually used with the coating during the previous month.
              (vi) If the volume of thinner actually used with the coating [paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section] is less than or equal to the total allowable volume of thinner for the coating [paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section], then compliance is demonstrated for the coating for the previous month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
              (3) Coatings to which the same thinning solvent will be added—group compliance. For coatings to which the same thinning solvent (or other material) is routinely or sometimes added, the owner or operator shall comply as follows:
              (i) Designate a single thinner to be added to each coating during the month and “group” coatings according to their designated thinner.
              (ii) Prior to the first application of each batch, calculate the maximum allowable thinning ratio (or ratios, if the affected source complies with the cold-weather limits in addition to the other limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart) for each batch of coating in the group using the equations in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (iii) Prior to the first application of each “batch,” notify painters and other persons, as necessary, of the designated thinner and maximum allowable thinning ratio(s) for each batch in the group by affixing a label to each container of coating or through another means described in the implementation plan required in § 63.787(b).
              (iv) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the volume of each batch of the group used, as supplied, during the previous month.
              (v) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the total allowable volume of thinner for the group for the previous month using Equation 3 of this subpart.
              (vi) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the volume of thinner actually used with the group during the previous month.
              (vii) If the volume of thinner actually used with the group [paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section] is less than or equal to the total allowable volume of thinner for the group [paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section], then compliance is demonstrated for the group for the previous month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
              (4) Demonstration of compliance through an alternative (i.e., other than Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60) test method. The owner or operator shall comply as follows:
              (i) Certify the as-supplied VOHAP content (g VOHAP/L solids) of each batch of coating.
              (ii) If no thinning solvent will be added to the coating, the owner or operator of an affected source shall follow the procedure described in § 63.785(c)(1), except that VOHAP content shall be used in lieu of VOC content.

              (iii) If thinning solvent will be added to the coating, the owner or operator of an affected source shall follow the procedure described in § 63.785(c)(2) or (3), except that in Equation 1 of this subpart: the term “mVOC” shall be replaced by the term “mVOHAP,” defined as the VOHAP content of the coating as supplied (g VOHAP/L coating) and the term “Dth” shall be replaced by the term “Dth(VOHAP)” defined as the average density of the VOHAP thinner(s) (g/L).
              (d) A violation revealed through any approved test method shall result in a 1-day violation for enforcement purposes. A violation revealed through the recordkeeping procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section shall result in a 30-day violation for enforcement purposes, unless the owner or operator provides sufficient data to demonstrate the specific days during which noncompliant coatings were applied.
              (e) Continuous compliance requirements. You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.786 for each affected source.
              (1) General requirements. (i) You must monitor and collect data, and provide a site specific monitoring plan, as required by §§ 63.783, 63.785, 63.786 and 63.787.
              (ii) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating, and periods of malfunction. Any period for which data collection is required and the operation of the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) is not otherwise exempt and for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
              (iii) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. The owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.

              [60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 72069, Nov. 21, 2011]
            
            
              § 63.786
              Test methods and procedures.

              (a) For the compliance procedures described in § 63.785(c) (1) through (c)(3), Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is the definitive method for determining the VOC content of coatings, as supplied or as applied. When a coating or thinner contains exempt compounds that are volatile HAP or VOHAP, the owner or operator shall ensure, when determining the VOC content of a coating, that the mass of these exempt compounds is included.
              (b) For the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(4), the Administrator must approve the test method for determining the VOHAP content of coatings and thinners. As part of the approval, the test method must meet the specified accuracy limits indicated below for sensitivity, duplicates, repeatability, and reproducibility coefficient of variation each determined at the 95 percent confidence limit. Each percentage value below is the corresponding coefficient of variation multiplied by 2.8 as in the ASTM Method E180-93: Standard Practice for Determining the Precision of ASTM Methods for Analysis and Testing of Industrial Chemicals (incorporation by reference—see § 63.14).
              (1) Sensitivity. The overall sensitivity must be sufficient to identify and calculate at least one mass percent of the compounds of interest based on the original sample. The sensitivity is defined as ten times the noise level as specified in ASTM Method D3257-93: Standard Test Methods for Aromatics in Mineral Spirits by Gas Chromatography (incorporation by reference—see § 63.14). In determining the sensitivity, the level of sample dilution must be factored in.
              (2) Repeatability. First, at the 0.1-5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if duplicates vary by more than 6 percent relative and/or day to day variation of mean duplicates by the same analyst exceeds 10 percent relative. Second, at greater than 5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if duplicates vary by more than 5 percent relative and/or day to day variation of duplicates by the same analyst exceeds 5 percent relative.
              (3) Reproducibility. First, at the 0.1-5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if lab to lab variation exceeds 60 percent relative. Second, at greater than 5 percent range the results would be suspect if lab to lab variation exceeds 20 percent relative.
              (4) Any test method should include information on the apparatus, reagents and materials, analytical procedure, procedure for identification and confirmation of the volatile species in the mixture being analyzed, precision and bias, and other details to be reported. The reporting should also include information on quality assurance (QA) auditing.
              (5) Multiple and different analytical techniques must be used for positive identification if the components in a mixture under analysis are not known. In such cases a single column gas chromatograph (GC) may not be adequate. A combination of equipment may be needed such as a GC/mass spectrometer or GC/infrared system. (If a GC method is used, the operator must use practices in ASTM Method E260-91 or 96: Standard Practice for Gas Chromatography [incorporation by reference—see § 63.14].)
              (c) A coating manufacturer or the owner or operator of an affected source may use batch formulation data as a test method in lieu of Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to certify the as-supplied VOC content of a coating if the manufacturer or the owner or operator has determined that batch formulation data have a consistent and quantitatively known relationship to Method 24 results. This determination shall consider the role of cure volatiles, which may cause emissions to exceed an amount based solely upon coating formulation data. Notwithstanding such determination, in the event of conflicting results, Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall take precedence.

              (d) Each owner or operator of an affected source shall use or ensure that the manufacturer uses the form and procedures mentioned in appendix A of this subpart to determine values for the thinner and coating parameters used in Equations 1 and 2 of this subpart. The owner or operator shall ensure that the coating/thinner manufacturer (or supplier) provides information on the VOC and VOHAP contents of the coatings/thinners and the procedure(s) used to determine these values.
              
              (e) For add-on control systems approved for use in limiting emissions from coating operations pursuant to § 63.783(c), performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to demonstrate the conditions present during performance tests.

Any owner or operator that receives approval pursuant to § 63.783(c) to use an add-on control system to control coating emissions shall comply with the applicable requirements of § 63.9(e) through (h).
              (b) Implementation plan. The provisions of § 63.9(a) apply to the requirements of this paragraph.
              (1) Each owner or operator of an affected source shall:
              (i) Prepare a written implementation plan that addresses each of the subject areas specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and
              (ii) Not later than one year after the effective date of this subpart, submit the implementation plan to the Administrator along with the notification required by § 63.9(b)(2) or (b)(5) of subpart A, as applicable.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3) Implementation plan contents. Each implementation plan shall address the following subject areas:
              (i) Coating compliance procedures. The implementation plan shall include the compliance procedure(s) under § 63.785(c) that the source intends to use.
              (ii) Recordkeeping procedures. The implementation plan shall include the procedures for maintaining the records required under § 63.788, including the procedures for gathering the necessary data and making the necessary calculations.
              (iii) Transfer, handling, and storage procedures. The implementation plan shall include the procedures for ensuring compliance with § 63.783(b).
              (4) Major sources that intend to become area sources by the compliance date. Existing major sources that intend to become area sources by the December 16, 1997 compliance date may choose to submit, in lieu of the implementation plan required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a statement that, by the compliance date, the major source intends to obtain and comply with federally enforceable limits on their potential to emit which make the facility an area source.

                  a The limits are expressed in two sets of equivalent units. Either set of limits may be used for the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(1), but only the limits expressed in units of g/L solids (nonvolatiles) shall be used for the compliance procedures described § 63.785(c) (2) through (4).
                
                  b VOC (including exempt compounds listed as HAP) shall be used as a surrogate for VOHAP for those compliance procedures described in § 63.785(c) (1) through (3).
                
                  c To convert from g/L to lb/gal, multiply by (3.785 L/gal)(1/453.6 lb/g) or 1/120. For compliance purposes, metric units define the standards.
                
                  d VOHAP limits expressed in units of mass of VOHAP per volume of solids were derived from the VOHAP limits expressed in units of mass of VOHAP per volume of coating assuming the coatings contain no water or exempt compounds and that the volumes of all components within a coating are additive.
                
                  e These limits apply during cold-weather time periods, as defined in § 63.782. Cold-weather allowances are not given to coatings in categories that permit less than 40 percent volume solids (nonvolatiles). Such coatings are subject to the same limits regardless of weather conditions.

              Source:
              60 FR 62936, Dec. 7, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 63.800
              Applicability.
              (a) The affected source to which this subpart applies is each facility that is engaged, either in part or in whole, in the manufacture of wood furniture or wood furniture components and that is located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, § 63.2. The owner or operator of a source that meets the definition for an incidental wood furniture manufacturer shall maintain purchase or usage records demonstrating that the source meets the definition in § 63.801 of this subpart, but the source shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subpart.
              (b) A source that complies with the limits and criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section is an area source for the purposes of this subpart and is not subject to any other provision of this rule, provided that: In the case of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), finishing materials, adhesives, cleaning solvents and washoff solvents used for wood furniture or wood furniture component manufacturing operations account for at least 90 percent of annual HAP emissions at the plant site, and if the plant site has HAP emissions that do not originate from the listed materials, the owner or operator shall keep any records necessary to demonstrate that the 90 percent criterion is being met. A source that initially relies on the limits and criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) to become an area source, but subsequently exceeds the relevant limit (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants below major source levels), becomes a major source and must comply thereafter with all applicable provisions of this subpart starting on the applicable compliance date in § 63.800. Nothing in this paragraph (b) is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.
              (1) The owner or operator of the source uses no more than 250 gallons per month, for every month, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials at the source, including materials used for source categories other than wood furniture (surface coating), but excluding materials used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility, or the use of toxic chemicals contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion). The owner or operator shall maintain records of the total gallons of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials used each month, and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. These records shall be maintained for five years.

              (2) The owner or operator of the source uses no more than 3,000 gallons per rolling 12-month period, for every 12-month period, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials at the source, including materials used for source categories other than wood furniture (surface coating), but excluding materials used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility, or the use of toxic chemicals contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion). A rolling 12-month period includes the previous 12 months of operation. The owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the total gallons of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials used each month and the total gallons used each previous month, and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. Because records are needed over the previous set of 12 months, the owner or operator shall keep monthly records beginning no less than one year before the compliance date specified in § 63.800(e). Records shall be maintained for five years.
              (3) The source emits no more than 4.5 Mg (5 tons) of any one HAP per rolling 12-month period and no more than 11.4 Mg (12.5 tons) of any combination of HAP per rolling 12-month period, and at least 90 percent of the plantwide emissions per rolling 12-month period are associated with the manufacture of wood furniture or wood furniture components.
              (c) This subpart does not apply to research or laboratory facilities as defined in § 63.801.
              (d) This subpart does not apply to any surface coating or coating operation that meets any of the criteria of paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) Surface coating of metal parts and products other than metal components of wood furniture that meets the applicability criteria for miscellaneous metal parts and products surface coating (subpart MMMM of this part).
              (2) Surface coating of plastic parts and products other than plastic components of wood furniture that meets the applicability criteria for plastic parts and products surface coating (subpart PPPP of this part).
              (3) Surface coating of wood building products that meets the applicability criteria for wood building products surface coating (subpart QQQQ of this part). The surface coating of millwork and trim associated with cabinet manufacturing are subject to subpart JJ.
              (4) Surface coating of metal furniture that meets the applicability criteria for metal furniture surface coating (subpart RRRR of this part). Surface coating of metal components of wood furniture performed at a wood furniture or wood furniture component manufacturing facility are subject to subpart JJ.
              (e) Owners or operators of affected sources shall also comply with the requirements of subpart A of this part (General Provisions), according to the applicability of subpart A to such sources, as identified in Table 1 of this subpart.
              (f) The compliance date for existing affected sources that emit less than 50 tons per year of HAP in 1996 is December 7, 1998. The compliance date for existing affected sources that emit 50 tons or more of hazardous air pollutants in 1996 is November 21, 1997. The owner or operator of an existing area source that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart one year after becoming a major source.
              (g) Existing affected sources shall be in compliance with § 63.802(a)(4) and § 63.803(h) no later than November 21, 2014. The owner or operator of an existing area source that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) hazardous air pollutants (HAP) such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 1 year after becoming a major source.
              (h) New affected sources must comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon startup or by December 7, 1995, whichever is later. New area sources that become major sources shall comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.
              (i) Reconstructed affected sources are subject to the requirements for new affected sources. The costs associated with the purchase and installation of air pollution control equipment (e.g., incinerators, carbon adsorbers, etc.) are not considered in determining whether the facility has been reconstructed, unless the control equipment is required as part of the process (e.g., product recovery). Additionally, the costs of retrofitting and replacement of equipment that is installed specifically to comply with this subpart are not considered reconstruction costs. For example, an affected source may convert to waterborne coatings to meet the requirements of this subpart. At most facilities, this conversion will require the replacement of existing storage tanks, mix equipment, and transfer lines. The cost of replacing the equipment is not considered in determining whether the facility has been reconstructed.

              (j) If the owner or operator, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.804, uses a control system as a means of limiting emissions, in response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the respondent fails to meet its burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owner or operator must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (i) The excess emissions:
              (A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
              (B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
              (iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (2) Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

                Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
              
                Alternative method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that is not a reference or equivalent method but has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to, in specific cases, produce results adequate for a determination of compliance.
              
                As applied means the HAP and solids content of the coating or contact adhesive that is actually used for coating or gluing the substrate. It includes the contribution of materials used for in-house dilution of the coating or contact adhesive.
              
                Basecoat means a coat of colored material, usually opaque, that is applied before graining inks, glazing coats, or other opaque finishing materials, and is usually topcoated for protection.

                Building enclosure means a building housing a process that meets the requirements of a temporary total enclosure. The EPA Method 204E is used to identify all emission points from the building enclosure and to determine which emission points must be tested. For additional information see Guidelines for Determining Capture Efficiency, January 1994. Docket No. A-93-10, Item No. IV-B-1.
              
                Capture device means a hood, enclosed room, floor sweep, or other means of collecting solvent emissions or other pollutants into a duct so that the pollutant can be directed to a pollution control device such as an incinerator or carbon adsorber.

Therefore, the reportable VHAP content shall represent the maximum aggregate emissions potential of the finishing material, adhesive, or solvent in concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight or 0.1 percent for VHAP that are carcinogens, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR part 1910), as formulated. Only VHAP present in concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight, or 0.1 percent for VHAP that are carcinogens, must be reported on the CPDS. The purpose of the CPDS is to assist the affected source in demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations presented in § 63.802.
              
                Note:
                Because the optimum analytical conditions under EPA Method 311 vary by coating, the coating or adhesive supplier may also choose to include on the CPDS the optimum analytical conditions for analysis of the coating, adhesive, or solvent using EPA Method 311. Such information may include, but not be limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.)

              (1) Identifies VHAP from the list presented in Table 5 of this subpart that are being used in finishing operations by the affected source;
              (2) Establishes a baseline level of usage by the affected source, for each VHAP identified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. The baseline usage level shall be the highest annual usage from 1994, 1995, or 1996, for each VHAP identified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. For formaldehyde, the baseline level of usage shall be based on the amount of free formaldehyde present in the finishing material when it is applied. For styrene, the baseline level of usage shall be an estimate of unreacted styrene, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of styrene monomer in the finishing material, when it is applied, by a factor of 0.16. Sources using a control device to reduce emissions may adjust their usage based on the overall control efficiency of the control system, which is determined using the equation in § 63.805 (d) or (e).
              (3) Tracks the annual usage of each VHAP identified in (l)(1) by the affected source that is present in amounts subject to MSDS reporting as required by OSHA.
              (4) If, after November 1998, the annual usage of the VHAP identified in paragraph (l)(1) exceeds its baseline level, then the owner or operator of the affected source shall provide a written notification to the permitting authority that describes the amount of the increase and explains the reasons for exceedance of the baseline level. The following explanations would relieve the owner or operator from further action, unless the affected source is not in compliance with any State regulations or requirements for that VHAP:
              (i) The exceedance is no more than 15.0 percent above the baseline level;
              (ii) Usage of the VHAP is below the de minimis level presented in Table 5 of this subpart for that VHAP (sources using a control device to reduce emissions may adjust their usage based on the overall control efficiency of the control system, which is determined using the procedures in § 63.805 (d) or (e);
              (iii) The affected source is in compliance with its State's air toxic regulations or guidelines for the VHAP; or
              (iv) The source of the pollutant is a finishing material with a VOC content of no more than 1.0 kg VOC/kg solids (1.0 lb VOC/lb solids), as applied.
              (5) If none of the above explanations are the reason for the increase, the owner or operator shall confer with the permitting authority to discuss the reason for the increase and whether there are practical and reasonable technology-based solutions for reducing the usage. The evaluation of whether a technology is reasonable and practical shall be based on cost, quality, and marketability of the product, whether the technology is being used successfully by other wood furniture manufacturing operations, or other criteria mutually agreed upon by the permitting authority and owner or operator. If there are no practical and reasonable solutions, the facility need take no further action. If there are solutions, the owner or operator shall develop a plan to reduce usage of the pollutant to the extent feasible. The plan shall address the approach to be used to reduce emissions, a timetable for implementing the plan, and a schedule for submitting notification of progress.

              (6) If, after November 1998, an affected source uses a VHAP of potential concern listed in table 6 of this subpart for which a baseline level has not been previously established, then the baseline level shall be established as the de minimis level provided in that same table for that chemical. The affected source shall track the annual usage of each VHAP of potential concern identified in this paragraph that is present in amounts subject to MSDS reporting as required by OSHA. If usage of the VHAP of potential concern exceeds the de minimis level listed in table 6 of this subpart for that chemical, then the affected source shall provide an explanation to the permitting authority that documents the reason for the exceedance of the de minimis level. If the explanation is not one of those listed in paragraphs (l)(4)(i) through (l)(4)(iv) of this section, the affected source shall follow the procedures in paragraph (l)(5) of this section.

              § 63.805
              Performance test methods.
              (a)(1) The EPA Method 311 of appendix A of part 63 shall be used in conjunction with formulation data to determine the VHAP content of the liquid coating. Formulation data shall be used to identify VHAP present in the coating. The EPA Method 311 shall then be used to quantify those VHAP identified through formulation data. The EPA Method 311 shall not be used to quantify HAP such as styrene and formaldehyde that are emitted during the cure. The EPA Method 24 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to determine the solids content by weight and the density of coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a coating does not release VOC or HAP byproducts during the cure, for example, all VOC and HAP present in the coating is solvent, then batch formulation information shall be accepted. The owner or operator of an affected source may request approval from the Administrator to use an alternative method for determining the VHAP content of the coating. In the event of any inconsistency between the EPA Method 24 or Method 311 test data and a facility's formulation data, that is, if the EPA Method 24/311 value is higher, the EPA Method 24/311 test shall govern unless after consultation, a regulated source could demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data were correct. Sampling procedures shall follow the guidelines presented in “Standard Procedures for Collection of Coating and Ink Samples for VOC Content Analysis by Reference Method 24 and Reference Method 24A,” EPA-340/1-91-010. (Docket No. A-93-10, Item No. IV-A-1).

              (2) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (b) Owners or operators demonstrating compliance in accordance with § 63.804 (f)(4) or (f)(6) and § 63.804 (g)(4) or (g)(6), or complying with any of the other emission limits of § 63.802 by operating a capture or control device shall determine the overall control efficiency of the control system (R) as the product of the capture and control device efficiency, using the test methods cited in § 63.805(c) and the procedures in § 63.805 (d) or (e).
              (c) When an initial compliance demonstration is required by § 63.804 (f)(4) or (f)(6) of this subpart, the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section shall be used in determining initial compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
              (1) The EPA Method 18 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to determine the HAP concentration of gaseous air streams. The test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
              (2) The EPA Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used for sample and velocity traverses.
              (3) The EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to measure velocity and volumetric flow rates.
              (4) The EPA Method 3 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to analyze the exhaust gases.
              (5) The EPA Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to measure the moisture in the stack gas.
              (6) The EPA Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test period.
              (d) Each owner or operator of an affected source demonstrating compliance in accordance with § 63.804 (f)(4) or (f)(6) shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:
              (1) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total HAP emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods specified in § 63.805(c) (1) through (6);
              (2) Determine capture efficiency from the affected emission point(s) by capturing, venting, and measuring all HAP emissions from the affected emission point(s). During a performance test, the owner or operator shall isolate affected emission point(s) located in an area with other nonaffected gaseous emission sources from all other gaseous emission point(s) by any of the following methods:
              (i) Build a temporary total enclosure (see § 63.801) around the affected emission point(s); or
              (ii) Use the building that houses the process as the enclosure (see § 63.801);
              (iii) Use any alternative protocol and test method provided they meet either the requirements of the data quality objective (DQO) approach or the lower confidence level (LCL) approach (see § 63.801);
              (iv) Shut down all nonaffected HAP emission point(s) and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected emission point(s) through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as drying ovens. All exhaust air must be vented through stacks suitable for testing; or
              (v) Use another methodology approved by the Administrator provided it complies with the EPA criteria for acceptance under part 63, appendix A, Method 301.
              (3) Operate the control device with all affected emission points that will subsequently be delivered to the control device connected and operating at maximum production rate;
              (4) Determine the efficiency (F) of the control device using the following equation:
              
                
                ER07DE95.000
              
              (5) Determine the efficiency (N) of the capture system using the following equation:
              
                ER07DE95.001
              

              (6) For each affected source complying with § 63.802(a)(1) in accordance with § 63.804(a)(3), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (F × N)(100) yields a value (R) such that the value of Eac in Equation 2 is no greater than 1.0.

              (9) For each new affected source complying with § 63.802(b)(2) in accordance with § 63.804(e)(2), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (F × N)(100) yields a value (R) such that the value of Gac in Equation 3 is no greater than 0.2.
              (e) An alternative method to the compliance method in § 63.805(d) is the installation of a permanent total enclosure around the affected emission point(s). A permanent total enclosure presents prima facia evidence that all HAP emissions from the affected emission point(s) are directed to the control device. Each affected source that complies using a permanent total enclosure shall:
              (1) Demonstrate that the total enclosure meets the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (iv). The owner or operator of an enclosure that does not meet these requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all HAP emissions from the affected emission point(s) are contained and vented to the control device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
              (i) The total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5 percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;
              (ii) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;
              (iii) The average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft openings shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:

              (A) All forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts are constructed so that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by the test methods specified in § 63.805 (c)(2) and (3). Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment normally made for moisture content; and
              (B) Determine FV by the following equation:
              
                ER07de95.002
              
              (iv) All access doors and windows whose areas are not included as natural draft openings and are not included in the calculation of FV shall be closed during routine operation of the process.
              (2) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (5), and the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.805 (c)(1) through (6).
              (3) For each affected source complying with § 63.802(a)(1) in accordance with § 63.804(a)(3), compliance is demonstrated if:
              (i) The installation of a permanent total enclosure is demonstrated (N = 1);
              (ii) The value of F is determined from Equation (5); and

              (iii) The product of (F × N)(100) yields a value (R) such that the value of Eac in Equation 2 is no greater than 1.0.
              (4) For each new affected source complying with § 63.802(b)(1) in accordance with § 63.804(d)(3), compliance is demonstrated if:
              (i) The installation of a permanent total enclosure is demonstrated (N = 1);
              (ii) The value of F is determined from Equation (5); and

              (iii) The product of (F × N)(100) yields a value (R) such that the value of Eac in Equation 4 is no greater than 0.8.
              (5) For each affected source complying with § 63.802(a)(2)(ii) in accordance with § 63.804(c)(2), compliance is demonstrated if:
              (i) The installation of a permanent total enclosure is demonstrated (N = 1);
              (ii) The value of F is determined from Equation (5); and

              61 FR 27140, May 30, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 63.820
              Applicability.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to:
              (1) Each new and existing facility that is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP), as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, at which publication rotogravure, product and packaging rotogravure, or wide-web flexographic printing presses are operated, and
              (2) Each new and existing facility at which publication rotogravure, product and packaging rotogravure, or wide-web flexographic printing presses are operated for which the owner or operator chooses to commit to and meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section for purposes of establishing the facility to be an area source of HAP with respect to this subpart. A facility which establishes area source status through some other mechanism, as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, is not subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (i) Use less than 9.1 Mg (10 tons) per each rolling 12-month period of each HAP at the facility, including materials used for source categories or purposes other than printing and publishing, and

              (ii) Use less than 22.7 Mg (25 tons) per each rolling 12-month period of any combination of HAP at the facility, including materials used for source categories or purposes other than printing and publishing.
              (3) Each facility for which the owner or operator chooses to commit to and meets the criteria stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be considered an area source, and is subject only to the provisions of §§ 63.829(d) and 63.830(b)(1) of this subpart.
              (4) Each facility for which the owner or operator commits to the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may exclude material used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining electric, propane, gasoline and diesel powered motor vehicles operated by the facility, and the use of HAP contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion).
              (5) Each facility for which the owner or operator commits to the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to become an area source, but subsequently exceeds either of the thresholds in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for any rolling 12-month period (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep its potential to emit HAP below major source levels), shall be considered in violation of its commitment for that 12-month period and shall be considered a major source of HAP beginning the first month after the end of the 12-month period in which either of the HAP-use thresholds was exceeded. As a major source of HAP, each such facility would be subject to the provisions of this subpart as noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and would no longer be eligible to use the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, even if in subsequent 12-month periods the facility uses less HAP than the thresholds in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (6) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section who chooses to no longer be subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall notify the Administrator of such change. If, by no longer being subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the facility at which the affected source is located becomes a major source:
              (i) The owner or operator of an existing source must continue to comply with the HAP usage provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the source is in compliance with all relevant requirements for existing affected sources under this subpart;
              (ii) The owner or operator of a new source must continue to comply with the HAP usage provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the source is in compliance with all relevant requirements for new affected sources under this subpart.
              (7) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a facility from establishing area source status by limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.
              (b) This subpart does not apply to research or laboratory equipment.
              (c) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:

              (i) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;
              (ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;
              (iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;
              (iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
              (v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;
              (vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation, if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;
              (vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;
              (viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (ix) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (2) Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

              § 63.822
              Definitions.
              (a) All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have the meaning given to them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.
              
                Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or a defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
              
                Always-controlled work station means a work station associated with a dryer from which the exhaust is delivered to a control device, with no provision for the dryer exhaust to bypass the control device. Sampling lines for analyzers and relief valves needed for safety purposes are not considered bypass lines.
              
                Capture efficiency means the fraction of all organic HAP emissions generated by a process that are delivered to a control device, expressed as a percentage.
              
                Capture system means a hood, enclosed room, or other means of collecting organic HAP emissions into a closed-vent system that exhausts to a control device.
              
                Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve or damper (e.g., from open to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve or damper cannot be changed without breaking the seal.
              
                Certified product data sheet (CPDS) means documentation furnished by suppliers of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, and other materials or by an independent third party that provides the organic HAP weight fraction of these materials determined in accordance with § 63.827(b), or the volatile matter weight fraction or solids weight fraction determined in accordance with § 63.827(c). A material safety data sheet (MSDS) may serve as a CPDS provided the MSDS meets the data requirements of § 63.827(b) and (c). The purpose of the CPDS is to assist the owner or operator in demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations presented in §§ 63.824-63.825.
              
                Coating means material applied onto or impregnated into a substrate for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Such materials include, but are not limited to, solvent-borne coatings, waterborne coatings, wax coatings, wax laminations, extrusion coatings, extrusion laminations, 100 percent solid adhesives, ultra-violet cured coatings, electron beam cured coatings, hot melt coatings, and cold seal coatings. Materials used to form unsupported substrates such as calendaring of vinyl, blown film, cast film, extruded film, and coextruded film are not considered coatings.
              
                Control device means a device such as a carbon adsorber or oxidizer which reduces the organic HAP in an exhaust gas by recovery or by destruction.
              
                Control device efficiency means the ratio of organic HAP emissions recovered or destroyed by a control device to the total organic HAP emissions that are introduced into the control device, expressed as a percentage.
              
                Day means a 24-consecutive-hour period.
              
                Facility means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common ownership or control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way.
              
                Flexible packaging means any package or part of a package the shape of which can be readily changed. Flexible packaging includes, but is not limited to, bags, pouches, labels, liners and wraps utilizing paper, plastic, film, aluminum foil, metalized or coated paper or film, or any combination of these materials.
              
                Flexographic press means an unwind or feed section, which may include more than one unwind or feed station (such as on a laminator), a series of individual work stations, one or more of which is a flexographic print station, any dryers (including interstage dryers and overhead tunnel dryers) associated with the work stations, and a rewind, stack, or collection section. The work stations may be oriented vertically, horizontally, or around the circumference of a single large impression cylinder. Inboard and outboard work stations, including those employing any other technology, such as rotogravure, are included if they are capable of printing or coating on the same substrate. A publication rotogravure press with one or more flexographic imprinters is not a flexographic press.
              
                Flexographic print station means a print station on which a flexographic printing operation is conducted. A flexographic print station includes an anilox roller that transfers material to a raised image (type or art) on a plate cylinder. The material is then transferred from the image on the plate cylinder to the web or sheet to be printed. A flexographic print station may include a fountain roller to transfer material from the reservoir to the anilox roller, or material may be transferred directly from the reservoir to the anilox roller. The materials applied are of a fluid, rather than paste, consistency.
              
                HAP applied means the organic HAP content of all inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvent, and other materials applied to a substrate by a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source.
              
                HAP used means the organic HAP applied by a publication rotogravure printing affected source, including all organic HAP used for cleaning, parts washing, proof presses, and all organic HAP emitted during tank loading, ink mixing, and storage.
              
                Intermittently-controllable work station means a work station associated with a dryer with provisions for the dryer exhaust to be delivered to or diverted from a control device depending on the position of a valve or damper.

              (a) Table 1 to this subpart provides cross references to the 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, general provisions, indicating the applicability of the general provisions requirements to this subpart KK.
              (b) Each owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart must at all times operate and maintain that affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.

              § 63.824
              Standards: Publication rotogravure printing.
              (a) Each owner or operator of any publication rotogravure printing affected source that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with these requirements on and after the compliance dates as specified in § 63.826 of this subpart.

              (b) Each publication rotogravure affected source shall limit emissions of organic HAP to no more than eight percent of the total volatile matter used each month. The emission limitation may be achieved by overall control of at least 92 percent of organic HAP used, by substitution of non-HAP materials for organic HAP, or by a combination of capture and control technologies and substitution of materials. To demonstrate compliance, each owner or operator shall follow the procedure in paragraph (b)(1) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by a solvent recovery device, the procedure in paragraph (b)(2) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by an oxidizer, and the procedure in paragraph (b)(3) of this section when no control device is used.
              (1) Each owner or operator using a solvent recovery device to control emissions shall demonstrate compliance by showing that the HAP emission limitation is achieved by following the procedures in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section:
              (i) Perform a liquid-liquid material balance for each month as follows:
              (A) Measure the mass of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by the affected source during the month.
              (B) Determine the organic HAP content of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent and other material used by the affected source during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(b)(1).
              (C) Determine the volatile matter content, including water, of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by the affected source during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(c)(1).
              (D) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative amount of volatile matter recovered by the solvent recovery device on a monthly basis. The device shall be initially certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±2.0 percent.
              (E) Measure the amount of volatile matter recovered for the month.

              (F) Calculate the overall effective organic HAP control efficiency (Re) for the month using Equation 1:
              
                ER30MY96.000
              
              For the purposes of this calculation, the mass fraction of organic HAP present in the recovered volatile matter is assumed to be equal to the mass fraction of organic HAP present in the volatile matter used.

              (G) The affected source is in compliance for the month, if Re is at least 92 percent each month.
              (ii) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:

              (A) Install continuous emission monitors to collect the data necessary to calculate the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream entering and the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device for each month such that the percent control efficiency (E) of the solvent recovery device can be calculated for the month. This requires continuous emission monitoring of the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device, the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device, and the volumetric gas flow rate through the solvent recovery device. A single continuous volumetric gas flow measurement should be sufficient for a solvent recovery device since the inlet and outlet volumetric gas flow rates for a solvent recovery device are essentially equal. Each month's individual inlet concentration values and corresponding individual gas flow rate values are multiplied and then summed to get the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device for the month. Each month's individual outlet concentration values and corresponding individual gas flow rate values are multiplied and then summed to get the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device for the month.
              (B) Determine the percent capture efficiency (F) of the capture system according to § 63.827(e).

              (C) Calculate the overall effective organic HAP control efficiency (Re) achieved for each month using Equation 2.

              (D) Install, calibrate, operate and maintain the instrumentation necessary to measure continuously the site-specific operating parameter established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5) whenever a publication rotogravure printing press is operated.

              (E) The affected source is in compliance with the requirement for the month if Re is at least 92 percent, and the capture device is operated at an average value greater than, or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5) for each three-hour period.
              (2) Each owner or operator using an oxidizer to control emissions shall demonstrate compliance by showing that the HAP emission limitation is achieved by following the procedure in either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section:
              (i) Demonstrate initial compliance through performance tests and continuing compliance through continuous monitoring as follows:
              (A) Determine the oxidizer destruction efficiency (E) using the procedure in § 63.827(d).
              (B) Determine the capture efficiency (F) using the procedure in § 63.827(e).
              (C) [Reserved]

              (D) Calculate the overall effective organic HAP control efficiency (Re) achieved using Equation 2.
              (E) The affected source is in initial compliance if Re is at least 92 percent. Demonstration of continuing compliance is achieved by continuous monitoring of an appropriate oxidizer operating parameter in accordance with § 63.828(a)(4), and by continuous monitoring of an appropriate capture system monitoring parameter in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5). The affected source is in continuing compliance if the capture device is operated at an average value greater than or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5), and
              (1) if an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer is used, the average combustion temperature for all three-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average combustion temperature established under § 63.827(d), or
              (2) if a catalytic oxidizer is used, the average catalyst bed inlet temperature for all three-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average catalyst bed inlet temperature established in accordance with § 63.827(d).
              (ii) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency. The percent control efficiency of the oxidizer shall be demonstrated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section except that separate continuous measurements of the inlet volumetric gas flow rate and the outlet volumetric gas flow rate are required for an oxidizer.
              (3) To demonstrate compliance without the use of a control device, each owner or operator shall compare the mass of organic HAP used to the mass of volatile matter used each month, as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) of this section:

              (i) Measure the mass of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used in the affected source during the month.
              
              (ii) Determine the organic HAP content of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(b)(1), and

              (2) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency following the procedures in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(xi) of this section:

This requires continuous emission monitoring of the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device, the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device, and the volumetric gas flow rate through the solvent recovery device.

              § 63.827
              Performance test methods.
              Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (a) An owner or operator using a control device to comply with the requirements of §§ 63.824-63.825 is not required to conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance if one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section are met:
              (1) A control device that is in operation prior to May 30, 1996, does not need to be tested if
              (i) It is equipped with continuous emission monitors for determining total organic volatile matter concentration and the volumetric gas flow rate, and capture efficiency has been determined in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, such that an overall organic HAP control efficiency can be calculated, and
              (ii) The continuous emission monitors are used to demonstrate continuous compliance in accordance with § 63.824(b)(1)(ii), § 63.825(b)(2)(ii), § 63.825(c)(2), or § 63.825(d)(2), as applicable, and § 63.828, or
              (2) The owner or operator has met the requirements of either § 63.7(e)(2)(iv) or § 63.7(h), or
              (3) The control device is a solvent recovery system and the owner or operator chooses to comply by means of a monthly liquid-liquid material balance.

              (b) Determination of the weight fraction organic HAP of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents, and other materials used by a publication rotogravure affected source shall be conducted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Determination of the weight fraction organic HAP of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents, and other materials applied by a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source shall be conducted according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the weight fraction organic HAP values are not determined using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator must submit an alternative test method for determining their values for approval by the Administrator in accordance with § 63.7(f). The recovery efficiency of the test method must be determined for all of the target organic HAP and a correction factor, if necessary, must be determined and applied.
              (1) Each owner or operator of a publication rotogravure affected source shall determine the weight fraction organic HAP of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by following one of the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
              (i) The owner or operator may test the material in accordance with Method 311 of appendix A of this part. The Method 311 determination may be performed by the owner or operator of the affected source, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party. The organic HAP content determined by Method 311 must be calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Include each organic HAP determined to be present at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds.
              (B) Express the weight fraction of each organic HAP included according to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.3791).
              (C) Calculate the total weight fraction of organic HAP in the tested material by summing the weight fraction of each organic HAP included according to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).
              (ii) The owner or operator may determine the weight fraction volatile matter of the material in accordance with § 63.827(c)(1) and use this value for the weight fraction organic HAP for all compliance purposes.
              (iii) The owner or operator may use formulation data to determine the weight fraction organic HAP of a material. Formulation data may be provided to the owner or operator on a CPDS by the supplier of the material or an independent third party. Formulation data may be used provided that the weight fraction organic HAP is calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section. In the event of an inconsistency between the formulation data and the result of Method 311 of appendix A of this part, where the test result is higher, the Method 311 data will take precedence unless, after consultation, the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
              (A) For each raw material used in making the material, include each organic HAP present in that raw material at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds. The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be determined by Method 311 of appendix A of this part, by an alternate method approved by the Administrator, or from a CPDS provided by the raw material supplier or an independent third party. The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be expressed as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291).

              (B) For each raw material used in making the material, the weight fraction contribution of each organic HAP, which is included according to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, in that raw material to the weight fraction organic HAP of the material is calculated by multiplying the weight fraction, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291), of that organic HAP in that raw material times the weight fraction of that raw material, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.2246), in the material. The product of each such multiplication is to be truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291 times 0.2246 yields 0.02899586 which truncates to 0.0289).
              (C) For each organic HAP which is included according to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the total weight fraction of that organic HAP in the material is calculated by adding the weight fraction contribution of that organic HAP from each raw material in which that organic HAP is included according to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. The sum of each such addition must be expressed to four places after the decimal point.
              (D) The total weight fraction of organic HAP in the material is the sum of the counted individual organic HAP weight fractions. This sum must be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).

              (i) The owner or operator may test the material in accordance with Method 311 of appendix A of this part. The Method 311 determination may be performed by the owner or operator of the affected source, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party. The organic HAP content determined by Method 311 must be calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Include each organic HAP determined to be present at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds.
              (B) Express the weight fraction of each organic HAP included according to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.3791).
              (C) Calculate the total weight fraction of organic HAP in the tested material by summing the weight fraction of each organic HAP included according to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).
              (ii) The owner or operator may determine the weight fraction volatile matter of the material in accordance with § 63.827(c)(2) and use this value for the weight fraction organic HAP for all compliance purposes.
              (iii) The owner or operator may use formulation data to determine the weight fraction organic HAP of a material. Formulation data may be provided to the owner or operator on a CPDS by the supplier of the material or an independent third party. Formulation data may be used provided that the weight fraction organic HAP is calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section. In the event of an inconsistency between the formulation data and the result of Method 311 of appendix A of this part, where the test result is higher, the Method 311 data will take precedence unless, after consultation, the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.

              (A) For each raw material used in making the material, include each organic HAP present in that raw material at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds. The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be determined by Method 311 of appendix A of this part, by an alternate method approved by the Administrator, or from a CPDS provided by the raw material supplier or an independent third party. The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be expressed as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291).
              (B) For each raw material used in making the material, the weight fraction contribution of each organic HAP, which is included according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, in that raw material to the weight fraction organic HAP of the material is calculated by multiplying the weight fraction, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291), of that organic HAP in that raw material times the weight fraction of that raw material, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.2246), in the material. The product of each such multiplication is truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291 times 0.2246 yields 0.02899586 which truncates to 0.0289).
              (C) For each organic HAP which is included according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the total weight fraction of that organic HAP in the material is calculated by adding the weight fraction contribution of that organic HAP from each raw material in which that organic HAP is included according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The sum of each such addition must be expressed to four places after the decimal point.
              (D) The total weight fraction of organic HAP in the material is the sum of the counted individual organic HAP weight fractions. This sum is to be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).
              (c) Determination of the weight fraction volatile matter content of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, reducers, thinners, diluents, and other materials used by a publication rotogravure affected source shall be conducted according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Determination of the weight fraction volatile matter content and weight fraction solids content of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, reducers, thinners, diluents, and other materials applied by a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source shall be conducted according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (1) Each owner or operator of a publication rotogravure affected source shall determine the volatile matter weight fraction of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, reducer, thinner, diluent, and other material used by following the procedures in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or by using formulation data as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (i) Determine the volatile matter weight fraction of the material using Method 24A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The Method 24A determination may be performed by the owner or operator of the affected source, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party. The Method 24A result shall be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763). If these values cannot be determined using Method 24A, the owner or operator shall submit an alternative technique for determining their values for approval by the Administrator.
              (2) Each owner or operator of a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source shall determine the volatile matter weight fraction and solids weight fraction of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, reducer, thinner, diluent, and other material applied by following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or by using formulation data as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (i) Determine the volatile matter weight fraction of the material using Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The Method 24 determination may be performed by the owner or operator of the affected source, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party. The Method 24 result shall be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763). If these values cannot be determined using Method 24, the owner or operator shall submit an alternative technique for determining their values for approval by the Administrator.

              (ii) Calculate the solids weight fraction Method 24 result by subtracting the volatile matter weight fraction Method 24 result from 1.000. This calculation may be performed by the owner or operator, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party.
              (3) The owner or operator may use formulation data to determine the volatile matter weight fraction or solids weight fraction of a material. Formulation data may be provided to the owner or operator on a CPDS by the supplier of the material or an independent third party. The volatile matter weight fraction and solids weight fraction shall be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763). In the event of any inconsistency between the formulation data and the result of Method 24 or Method 24A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, where the test result for volatile matter weight fraction is higher or the test result for solids weight fraction is lower, the applicable test method data will take precedence unless, after consultation, the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.

The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with notice of the performance test required under § 63.7(c). The same method must be used for both the inlet and outlet measurements. The owner or operator may use Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, if (A) An exhaust gas organic volatile matter concentration of 50 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less as carbon is required to comply with the standards of §§ 63.824-63.825, or
              (B) The organic volatile matter concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control are such to result in exhaust gas organic volatile matter concentrations of 50 ppmv or less as carbon, or
              (C) Because of the high efficiency of the control device, the anticipated organic volatile matter concentration at the control device exhaust is 50 ppmv or less as carbon, regardless of inlet concentration, or

For the purpose of determining organic volatile matter concentrations and mass flow rates, the average of results of all runs shall apply.
              (viii) Organic volatile matter mass flow rates shall be determined using Equation 20:
              
                
                ER24MY06.003

                ER30MY96.020
              
              (2) The owner or operator shall record such process information as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance test. Operations during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.
              (3) For the purpose of determining the value of the oxidizer operating parameter that will demonstrate continuing compliance, the time-weighted average of the values recorded during the performance test shall be computed. For an oxidizer other than catalytic oxidizer, the owner or operator shall establish as the operating parameter the minimum combustion temperature. For a catalytic oxidizer, the owner or operator shall establish as the operating parameter the minimum gas temperature upstream of the catalyst bed.

              (1) You may assume your capture efficiency equals 100 percent if your capture system is a permanent total enclosure (PTE). You must confirm that your capture system is a PTE by demonstrating that it meets the requirements of section 6 of Method 204 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M, and that all exhaust gases from the enclosure are delivered to a control device.
              (2) You may determine capture efficiency according to the protocols for testing with temporary total enclosures that are specified in Methods 204 and 204A through F of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M.

              Appendix A to Subpart KK of Part 63—Data Quality Objective and Lower Confidence Limit Approaches for Alternative Capture Efficiency Protocols and Test Methods
              1. Introduction
              1.1 Alternative capture efficiency (CE) protocols and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality objective (DQO) approach or the lower confidence limit (LCL) approach are acceptable under § 63.827(f). The general criteria for alternative CE protocols and test methods to qualify under either the DQO or LCL approach are described in section 2. The DQO approach and criteria specific to the DQO approach are described in section 3. The LCL approach and criteria specific to the LCL approach are described in section 4. The recommended reporting for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in section 5. The recommended recordkeeping for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in section 6.
              1.2 Although the Procedures L, G.1, G.2, F.1, and F.2 in § 52.741 of part 52 were developed for TTE and BE testing, the same procedures can also be used in an alternative CE protocol. For example, a traditional liquid/gas mass balance CE protocol could employ Procedure L to measure liquid VOC input and Procedure G.1 to measure captured VOC.
              2. General Criteria for DQO and LCL Approaches

              2.1 The following general criteria must be met for an alternative capture efficiency protocol and test methods to qualify under the DQO or LCL approach.
              
              2.2 An alternative CE protocol must consist of at least three valid test runs. Each test run must be at least 20 minutes long. No test run can be longer than 24 hours.
              2.3 All test runs must be separate and independent. For example, liquid VOC input and output must be determined independently for each run. The final liquid VOC sample from one run cannot be the initial sample for another run. In addition, liquid input for an entire day cannot be apportioned among test runs based on production.
              2.4 Composite liquid samples cannot be used to obtain an “average composition” for a test run. For example, separate initial and final coating samples must be taken and analyzed for each run; initial and final samples cannot be combined prior to analysis to derive an “average composition” for the test run.
              2.5 All individual test runs that result in a CE of greater than 105 percent are invalid and must be discarded.
              2.6 If the source can demonstrate to the regulatory agency that a test run should not be considered due to an identified testing or analysis error such as spillage of part of the sample during shipping or an upset or improper operating conditions that is not considered part of normal operation then the test result for that individual test run may be discarded. This limited exception allows sources to discard as “outliers” certain individual test runs without replacing them with a valid test run as long as the facility has at least three valid test runs to use when calculating its DQO or LCL. This exception is limited solely to test runs involving the types of errors identified above.
              2.7 All valid test runs that are conducted must be included in the average CE determination. The individual test run CE results and average CE results cannot be truncated (i.e., 105 percent cannot be reported as 100 + percent) for purposes of meeting general or specific criteria for either the DQO or the LCL. If the DQO is satisfied and the average CE is greater than 100, then 100 percent CE must be considered the result of the test.
              2.8 Alternative test methods for measuring VOC concentration must include a three-point calibration of the gas analysis instrument in the expected concentration range.
              3. Data Quality Objective Approach
              3.1 The purpose of the DQO is to allow sources to use alternative CE protocols and test methods while ensuring reasonable precision consistent with pertinent requirements of the Clean Air Act. In addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific DQO criterion is that the width of the two-sided 95 percent confidence interval of the mean measured value must be less than or equal to 10 percent of the mean measured value (see Figure 1). This ensures that 95 percent of the time, when the DQO is met, the actual CE value will be ±5 percent of the mean measured value (assuming that the test protocol is unbiased).

              Where:
              
              a = Distance from the average measured CE value to the endpoints of the 95-percent (two-sided) confidence interval for the measured value.
              n = Number of valid test runs.
              P = DQO indicator statistic, distance from the average measured CE value to the endpoints of the 95-percent (two-sided) confidence interval, expressed as a percent of the average measured CE value.
              s = Sample standard deviation.
              t0.975 = t-value at the 95-percent (two-sided) confidence level (see Table A-1).
              xavg = Average measured CE value (calculated from all valid test runs).
              xi = The CE value calculated from the ith test run.

              3.3 The sample standard deviation and average CE value are calculated using Equations 3 and 4 as follows:
              
                er30my96.024
              
              
                er30my96.025
              
              3.4 The DQO criteria are achieved when all of the general criteria in section 2 are achieved and P ≤5 percent (i.e., the specific DQO criterion is achieved). In order to meet this objective, facilities may have to conduct more than three test runs. Examples of calculating P, given a finite number of test runs, are shown below. (For purposes of this example it is assumed that all of the general criteria are met.)
              3.5 Facility A conducted a CE test using a traditional liquid/gas mass balance and submitted the following results and the calculations shown in Equations 5 and 6:
              
                
                  Run

              n = 3
              t0.975 = 4.30

              3.6 Since the facility did not meet the specific DQO criterion, they ran three more test runs.

              3.7 The calculations for Runs 1-6 are made as follows using Equations 7 and 8:
              
              n = 6
              t0.975 = 2.57
              xavg = 96.6

                ER30MY96.029
              
              
              3.8 The facility still did not meet the specific DQO criterion. They ran three more test runs with the following results:
              
                
                  Run

                  91.0
                
              
              3.9 The calculations for Runs 1-9 are made as follows using Equations 9 and 10:
              n = 9
              t0.975 = 2.31
              xavg = 95.7
              s = 5.33
              
                ER30MY96.030
              
              
                ER30MY96.031
              
              3.10 Based on these results, the specific DQO criterion is satisfied. Since all of the general criteria were also satisfied, the average CE from the nine test runs can be used to determine compliance.
              4. Lower Confidence Limit Approach
              4.1 The purpose of the LCL approach is to provide sources, that may be performing much better than their applicable regulatory requirement, a screening option by which they can demonstrate compliance. The approach uses less precise methods and avoids additional test runs which might otherwise be needed to meet the specific DQO criterion while still being assured of correctly demonstrating compliance. It is designed to reduce “false positive” or so called “Type II errors” which may erroneously indicate compliance where more variable test methods are employed. Because it encourages CE performance greater than that required in exchange for reduced compliance demonstration burden, the sources that successfully use the LCL approach could produce emission reductions beyond allowable emissions. Thus, it could provide additional benefits to the environment as well.
              4.2 The LCL approach compares the 80 percent (two-sided) LCL for the mean measured CE value to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. In addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific LCL criteria are that either the LCL be greater than or equal to the applicable CE regulatory requirement or that the specific DQO criterion is met. A more detailed description of the LCL approach follows:
              4.3 A source conducts an initial series of at least three runs. The owner or operator may choose to conduct additional test runs during the initial test if desired.
              4.4 If all of the general criteria are met and the specific DQO criterion is met, then the average CE value is used to determine compliance.
              4.5 If the data meet all of the general criteria, but do not meet the specific DQO criterion; and the average CE, using all valid test runs, is above 100 percent then the test sequence cannot be used to calculate the LCL. At this point the facility has the option of (a) conducting more test runs in hopes of meeting the DQO or of bringing the average CE for all test runs below 100 percent so the LCL can be used or (b) discarding all previous test data and retesting.
              4.6 The purpose of the requirement in Section 4.5 is to protect against protocols and test methods which may be inherently biased high. This is important because it is impossible to have an actual CE greater than 100 percent and the LCL approach only looks at the lower end variability of the test results. This is different from the DQO which allows average CE values up to 105 percent because the DQO sets both upper and lower limits on test variability.
              4.7 If at any point during testing the results meet the DQO, the average CE can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulatory requirement. Similarly, if the average CE is below 100 percent then the LCL can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulatory requirement without regard to the DQO.
              4.8 The LCL is calculated at an 80 percent (two-sided) confidence level as follows using Equation 11:
              
                ER24MY06.006
              
              Where:
              
              LC1 = LCL at an 80-percent (two-sided) confidence level.
              n = Number of valid test runs.
              s = Sample standard deviation.
              t0.90 = t-value at the 80-percent (two-sided) confidence level (see Table A-1).
              xavg = Average measured CE value (calculated from all valid test runs).
              
              4.9 The resulting LC1 is compared to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. If LC1 exceeds (i.e., is higher than) the applicable regulatory requirement, then a facility is in initial compliance. However, if the LC1 is below the CE requirement, then the facility must conduct additional test runs. After this point the test results will be evaluated not only looking at the LCL, but also the DQO of ±5 percent of the mean at a 95 percent confidence level. If the test results with the additional test runs meet the DQO before the LCL exceeds the applicable CE regulatory requirement, then the average CE value will be compared to the applicable CE regulatory requirement for determination of compliance.
              

              4.10 If there is no specific CE requirement in the applicable regulation, then the applicable CE regulatory requirement is determined based on the applicable regulation and an acceptable destruction efficiency test. If the applicable regulation requires daily compliance and the latest CE compliance demonstration was made using the LCL approach, then the calculated LC1 will be the highest CE value which a facility is allowed to claim until another CE demonstration test is conducted. This last requirement is necessary to assure both sufficiently reliable test results in all circumstances and the potential environmental benefits referenced above.
              4.11 An example of calculating the LCL is shown below. Facility B's applicable regulatory requirement is 85 percent CE. Facility B conducted a CE test using a traditional liquid/gas mass balance and submitted the following results and the calculation shown in Equation 12:
              
                
                  Run
                  CE
                
                
                  1
                  94.2
                
                
                  2
                  97.6
                
                
                  3
                  90.5
                
              
              Therefore:
              
              n = 3
              t0.90 = 1.886
              xavg = 94.1
              s = 3.55
              
                ER30MY96.033
              
              4.12 Since the LC1 of 90.23 percent is above the applicable regulatory requirement of 85 percent then the facility is in compliance. The facility must continue to accept the LC1 of 90.23 percent as its CE value until a new series of valid tests is conducted. (The data generated by Facility B do not meet the specific DQO criterion.)
              5. Recommended Reporting for Alternative CE Protocols
              5.1 If a facility chooses to use alternative CE protocols and test methods that satisfy either the DQO or LCL and the additional criteria in section 4., the following information should be submitted with each test report to the appropriate regulatory agency:
              1. A copy of all alternative test methods, including any changes to the EPA reference methods, QA/QC procedures and calibration procedures.
              2. A table with information on each liquid sample, including the sample identification, where and when the sample was taken, and the VOC content of the sample;
              3. The coating usage for each test run (for protocols in which the liquid VOC input is to be determined);
              4. The quantity of captured VOC measured for each test run;
              5. The CE calculations and results for each test run;
              6. The DQO or LCL calculations and results; and
              7. The QA/QC results, including information on calibrations (e.g., how often the instruments were calibrated, the calibration results, and information on calibration gases, if applicable).
              6. Recommended Recordkeeping for Alternative CE Protocols.
              6.1 A record should be kept at the facility of all raw data recorded during the test in a suitable form for submittal to the appropriate regulatory authority upon request.

              (i) Maintenance, repair, and replacement that the applicable regulatory authority determines to be routine for the potroom group;
              (ii) An increase in production rate of an existing potroom group, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on that potroom group;

              (2) The provisions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iv) of this section apply when the applicable regulatory authority must determine if a potroom group meets the definition of reconstructed potroom group.
              (i) “Fixed capital cost” means the capital needed to provide all the depreciable components.
              (ii) If an owner or operator of an existing potroom group proposes to replace components, and the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new potroom group, he/she shall notify the applicable regulatory authority of the proposed replacements. The notice must be postmarked 60 days (or as soon as practicable) before construction of the replacements is commenced and must include the following information:

              (iv) The applicable regulatory authority's determination under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall be based on:
              (A) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new potroom group;

              (B) The estimated life of the potroom group after the replacements compared to the life of a comparable entirely new potroom group;

                L1 = the lower TF emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton);
                f1 = the fraction of the potline's total aluminum production capacity that is contained within all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups;
                LPG1 = 0.95 kg/Mg (1.9 lb/ton) for prebake potlines and 1.0 kg/Mg (2.0 lb/ton) for Soderberg potlines; and
                LPL = the TF emission limit from § 63.843(a)(1) for the appropriate potline subcategory that would have otherwise applied to the potline.
              
              
              (c) Upper TF emission limit. The owner or operator shall calculate an upper TF emission limit for any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group using the following equation:

                Where:
                
                L2 = the upper TF emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton); and
                LPG2 = 1.25 kg/Mg (2.5 lb/ton) for prebake potlines and 1.3 kg/Mg (2.6 lb/ton) for Soderberg potlines.
              
              
              (d) Recalculation. The TF emission limits in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be recalculated each time a new potroom group is added to the potline and each time an additional potroom group meets the definition of “modified potroom group” or “reconstructed potroom group.”
              (e) Emission limitation. The owner or operator shall not discharge or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere emissions of TF from any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group that exceed the lower emission limit calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, except that emissions less than the upper limit calculated in paragraph (c) of this section will be considered in compliance if the owner or operator demonstrates that exemplary operation and maintenance procedures were used with respect to the emission control system and that proper control equipment was operating at the potline during the performance test.
              (f) Report. Within 30 days of any performance test that reveals emissions that fall between the lower limit calculated in paragraph (b) of this section and the upper limit calculated in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit to the applicable regulatory authority a report indicating whether all necessary control devices were online and operating properly during the performance test, describing the operating and maintenance procedures followed, and setting forth any explanation for the excess emissions.

Representativeness shall be based on showing that all of the potroom groups associated with the potline are substantially equivalent in terms of their structure, operability, type of emissions, volume of emissions, and concentration of emissions.

              (3) Calculate the TF emissions for the potline in kg/Mg (lb/ton) based on the production-weighted average of the TF emission rates from paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section using the following equation:
              
              E = f1 × EPG1 + (1-f1) × EPL
              
              
              
                where:
                
                E = the TF emission rate for the entire potline, kg/Mg (lb/ton);
                f1 = the fraction of the potline's total aluminum production rate that is contained within all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups;
                EPG1 = the TF emission rate from paragraph (g)(1) of this section for all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups, kg/Mg (lb/ton); and
                EPL = the TF emission rate for the balance of the potline from paragraph (g)(2) of this section, kg/Mg (lb/ton).
              
              
              Compliance is demonstrated when TF emissions for the potline meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (4) As an alternative to sampling as required in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may perform representative sampling of the entire potline subject to the approval of the applicable regulatory authority. Such sampling shall provide coverage by the sampling equipment of both the new, modified, or reconstructed potroom group and the balance of the potline. The coverage for the new, modified, or reconstructed potroom group must meet the criteria specified in the reference methods in § 63.849. TF emissions shall be determined for the potline using the procedures, equations, and test methods in §§ 63.847, 63.848, and 63.849. Compliance is demonstrated when TF emissions for the potline meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (h) Opacity. Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall not discharge or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group any emissions of gases that exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater.
              (i) Alternative opacity limit. An alternative opacity limit may be established in place of the opacity limit in paragraph (h) of this section using the following procedures:
              (1) If the regulatory authority finds that a potline is in compliance with the applicable TF standard for which performance tests are conducted in accordance with the methods and procedures in § 63.849 but during the time such performance tests are being conducted fails to meet any applicable opacity standard, the regulatory authority shall notify and advise the owner or operator that he/she may petition the regulatory authority within 10 days of receipt of notification to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard.
              (2) The regulatory authority will grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that the potroom group and associated air pollution control equipment were operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the regulatory authority; and that the potroom group and associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.

              (3) As indicated by the performance and opacity tests, the regulatory authority will establish an opacity standard for any potroom group meeting the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section such that the opacity standard could be met by the potroom group at all times during which the potline is meeting the TF emission limit.
              
              (4) The alternative opacity limit established in paragraph (i)(3) of this section shall not be greater than 20 percent opacity.

              § 63.848
              Emission monitoring requirements.
              (a) TF and PM emissions from potlines. Using the procedures in § 63.847 and in the approved test plan, the owner or operator shall monitor emissions of TF and PM from each potline by conducting annual performance tests on the primary control system and semiannual performance tests on the secondary emissions. The owner or operator shall compute and record the average semiannually from at least three runs for secondary emissions and the average from at least three runs for the primary control system to determine compliance with the applicable emission limit. The owner or operator must include all valid runs in the semiannual average. The duration of each run for secondary emissions must represent a complete operating cycle. Potline emissions shall be recorded as the sum of the average of at least three runs from the primary control system and the average of at least three runs from the roof monitor or secondary emissions control device.
              (b) POM emissions from potlines. Using the procedures in § 63.847 and in the approved test plan, the owner or operator must monitor emissions of POM from each potline stack annually and secondary potline POM emissions semiannually. The owner or operator must compute and record the semiannual average from at least three runs for secondary emissions and at least three runs for the primary control systems to determine compliance with the applicable emission limit. The owner or operator must include all valid runs in the semiannual average. The duration of each run for secondary emissions must represent a complete operating cycle. The primary control system must be sampled over an 8-hour period, unless site-specific factors dictate an alternative sampling time subject to the approval of the regulatory authority. Potline emissions shall be recorded as the sum of the average of at least three runs from the primary control system and the average of at least three runs from the roof monitor or secondary emissions control device.
              (c) TF, PM, Hg and POM emissions from anode bake furnaces. Using the procedures in § 63.847 and in the approved test plan, the owner or operator shall determine TF, PM, Hg and POM emissions from each anode bake furnace on an annual basis. The owner or operator shall compute and record the annual average of TF, PM, Hg and POM emissions from at least three runs to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits. A minimum of four dscm per run must be collected for monitoring of Hg emissions. The owner or operator must include all valid runs in the annual average.
              (d) Similar potlines. As an alternative to semiannual monitoring of TF, POM or PM secondary emissions from each potline using the methods in § 63.849, the owner or operator may perform semiannual monitoring of TF, POM or PM secondary emissions from one potline using the test methods in § 63.849(a) or (b) to represent the performance of similar potline(s). The similar potline(s) must be monitored using an alternative method that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this section. Two or more potlines are similar if the owner or operator demonstrates that their structure, operability, type of emissions, volume of emissions and concentration of emissions are substantially equivalent.

              (ii) For TF, POM and PM emissions, must meet or exceed Method 14 criteria.
              (2) An HF continuous emission monitoring system is an approved alternative for the monitoring of TF secondary emissions.
              (3) An owner or operator electing to use an alternative monitoring procedure shall establish an alternative emission limit based on at least nine simultaneous runs using the applicable test methods and the alternative monitoring method. All runs must represent a full process cycle.
              (4) The owner or operator shall derive an alternative emission limit for the HF continuous emission monitor or an alternative method using either of the following procedures:
              (i) Use the highest value from the alternative method associated with a simultaneous run by the applicable test method that does not exceed the applicable emission limit; or

              (ii) Correlate the results of the two methods (the applicable test method results and the alternative monitoring method results) and establish an emission limit for the alternative monitoring system that corresponds to the applicable emission limit.
              (5) The owner or operator shall submit the results required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and all supporting documentation to the applicable regulatory authority for review and approval.
              (6) The regulatory authority shall review and approve or disapprove the request for an alternative method and alternative emission limit. The criterion for approval shall be a demonstration (to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority) that the alternative method and alternative emission limit achieve a level of emission control that is the same as or better than the level that would have otherwise been achieved by the applicable method and emission limit.
              (7) If the alternative method is approved by the applicable regulatory authority, the owner or operator must perform semiannual emission monitoring using the approved alternative monitoring procedure to demonstrate compliance with the alternative emission limit for each similar potline.

Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time and duration of each failure. For each failure, the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, and for any failure to meet an emission limit under § 63.862, provide an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
              (5) The owner or operator of an affected source or process unit subject to the requirements of this subpart and subpart S of this part may combine excess emissions and/or summary reports for the mill.
              (d) Electronic reporting. (1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test following the procedure specified in either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

              (i) For data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site (https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/electronic-reporting-tool-ert) at the time of the test, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). (CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (https://cdx.epa.gov/).) Performance test data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file format consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site. If the owner or operator claims that some of the performance test information being submitted is confidential business information (CBI), the owner or operator must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (d)(1)(i).
              (ii) For data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site at the time of the test, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13 unless the Administrator agrees to or specifies an alternative reporting method.

              (2) The owner or operator must submit the notifications required in § 63.9(b) and § 63.9(h) (including any information specified in § 63.867(b)) and semiannual reports to the EPA via the CEDRI. (CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's CDX (https://cdx.epa.gov).) You must upload an electronic copy of each notification in CEDRI beginning with any notification specified in this paragraph that is required after October 11, 2019. The owner or operator must use the appropriate electronic report in CEDRI for this subpart listed on the CEDRI Web site (https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/compliance-and-emissions-data-reporting-interface-cedri) for semiannual reports. If the reporting form specific to this subpart is not available in CEDRI at the time that the report is due, you must submit the report to the Administrator at all the appropriate addresses listed in § 63.13. Once the form has been available in CEDRI for 1 year, you must begin submitting all subsequent reports via CEDRI. The reports must be submitted by the deadlines specified in this subpart, regardless of the method in which the reports are submitted.
              (3) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

              (4) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (e.g., large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

              Definitions.
              Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in § 63.2, or in this section as follows:
              
                Bag leak detection system means systems that include, but are not limited to, devices using triboelectric, light scattering, and other effects to monitor relative or absolute particulate matter emissions.
              
                Gas-fired glass-melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature using natural gas and other fuels, refined, and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations, superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat exchangers, exhaust system, refractory brick work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and distributing molten glass to forming processes. The forming apparatus, including flow channels, is not considered part of the gas-fired glass-melting furnace. Cold-top electric glass-melting furnaces as defined in subpart NNN of this part are not gas-fired glass-melting furnaces.
              
                Glass pull rate means the mass of molten glass that is produced by a single glass-melting furnace or that is used in the manufacture of wool fiberglass at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.
              
                Incinerator means an enclosed air pollution control device that uses controlled flame combustion to convert combustible materials to noncombustible gases. For the purposes of this subpart, the term “incinerator” means “regenerative thermal oxidizer”.
              
                Manufacturing line means the manufacturing equipment for the production of wool fiberglass that consists of a forming section where molten glass is fiberized and a fiberglass mat is formed and which may include a curing section where binder resin in the mat is thermally set and a cooling section where the mat is cooled.
              
                New source means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after April 15, 2013.
              
                Wool fiberglass means insulation materials composed of glass fibers made from glass produced or melted at the same facility where the manufacturing line is located.
              
                Wool fiberglass manufacturing facility means any facility manufacturing wool fiberglass.

                Closure device means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a fixed roof. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
              
                Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a tank in a stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the liquid managed in the tank.
              
                No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.905(a) of this subpart.
              
                Regulated-material means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in tanks using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
              
                Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event.

              § 63.902
              Standards—Tank fixed roof.
              (a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and controlling air emissions from a tank using a fixed roof. This section does not apply to a fixed-roof tank that is also equipped with an internal floating roof.
              (b) The tank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications:
              (1) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid in the tank. The fixed roof may be a separate cover installed on the tank (e.g., a removable cover mounted on an open-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural design (e.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a hatch).
              (2) The fixed roof shall be installed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof edge and the tank wall.
              (3) Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the fixed roof, shall be either:
              (i) equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the opening and the closure device; or
              (ii) connected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device. The control device shall remove or destroy organics in the vent stream, and shall be operating whenever regulated material is managed in the tank.
              (4) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the liquid or its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the tank on which the fixed roof is installed.
              (c) Whenever a regulated-material is in the tank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed position except as follows:
              (1) Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the following times:

              (i) To provide access to the tank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the tank, or when a worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the tank.
              
              (ii) To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of tank.
              (2) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with the tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.
              (3) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.901 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.
              (d) The owner or operator shall inspect the air emission control equipment in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.906(a) of this subpart.

              § 63.905
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
              (1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
              (2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
              (3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
              (4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

              (7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
              (8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
              (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
              (ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.

              § 63.906
              Inspection and monitoring requirements.
              (a) Owners and operators that use a tank equipped with a fixed roof in accordance with the provisions of § 63.902 of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:
              (1) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the tank wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.
              (2) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the fixed roof. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (3) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (4) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.907 (a) of this subpart.
              (b) The owner or operator shall repair all detected defects as follows:
              (1) The owner or operator shall make first efforts at repair of the defect no later than 5 calendar days after detection and repair shall be completed as soon as possible but no later than 45 calendar days after detection except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

              (2) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary removal from service of the tank and no alternative tank capacity is available at the site to accept the regulated material normally managed in the tank. In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time alternative tank capacity becomes available and the tank can be emptied or temporarily removed from service, as necessary to complete the repair.
              (c) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.907(b) of this subpart.
              (d) Alternative inspection and monitoring interval. Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a fixed roof in accordance with this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as “unsafe to inspect and monitor.” The documentation must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.
              (2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.

              Standards—Container Level 1 controls.
              (a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and required to control air emissions from containers using Container Level 1 controls.
              (b) A container using Container Level 1 controls is one of the following:
              (1) A container that meets the applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous materials for transportation as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (2) A container equipped with a cover and closure devices that form a continuous barrier over the container openings such that when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position there are no visible holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container. The cover may be a separate cover installed on the container (e.g., a lid on a drum, a suitably secured tarp on a roll-off box) or may be an integral part of the container structural design (e.g., a bulk cargo container equipped with a screw-type cap).
              (3) An open-top container in which an organic vapor-suppressing barrier is placed on or over the regulated-material in the container such that no regulated-material is exposed to the atmosphere. One example of such a barrier is application of a suitable organic-vapor suppressing foam.
              (c) A container used to meet the requirements of either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section shall be equipped with covers and closure devices, as applicable to the container, that are composed of suitable materials to minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere and to maintain the equipment integrity for as long as it is in service. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the cover and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of contact with the material or its vapor managed in the container; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for container on which the cover is installed.
              (d) Whenever a regulated-material is in a container using Container Level 1 controls, the owner or operator shall install all covers and closure devices for the container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed position except as follows:
              (1) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of adding material to the container as follows:
              (i) In the case when the container is filled to the intended final level in one continuous operation, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling operation.
              (ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material intermittently are added to the container over a period of time, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon either: the container being filled to the intended final level; the completion of a batch loading after which no additional material will be added to the container within 15 minutes; the person performing the loading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container; or the shutdown of the process generating the material being added to the container, whichever condition occurs first.
              (2) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of removing material from the container as follows:
              (i) For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart may be open to the atmosphere at any time (e.g., covers and closure devices are not required to be secured in the closed position on an empty container).

              (ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are removed from the container but the container does not meet the conditions to be an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal after which no additional material will be removed from the container within 15 minutes, or the person performing the unloading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, whichever condition occurs first.
              (3) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed when access inside the container is needed to perform routine activities other than transfer of regulated-material. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to measure the depth of or sample the material in the container, or when a worker needs to open a manhole hatch to access equipment inside the container. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable to the container.
              (4) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the container internal pressure in accordance with the container design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the container internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on container manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the container as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.

              § 63.923
              Standards—Container Level 2 controls.
              (a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and required to control air emissions from containers using Container Level 2 controls.

              (b) A container using Container Level 2 controls is one of the following:
              
              (1) A container that meets the applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous materials for transportation as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (2) A container that has been demonstrated to operate with no detectable organic emissions as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart.
              (3) A container that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to be vapor-tight by using Method 27 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 in accordance with the procedure specified in § 63.925(b) of this subpart.
              (c) Transfer of regulated-material in to or out of a container using Container Level 2 controls shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, considering the physical properties of the regulated-material and good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, ignitable, explosive, or other hazardous materials. Examples of container loading procedures that meet the requirements of this paragraph include using any one of the following: a submerged-fill pipe or other submerged-fill method to load liquids into the container; a vapor-balancing system or a vapor-recovery system to collect and control the vapors displaced from the container during filling operations; or a fitted opening in the top of a container through which the regulated-material is filled, with subsequent purging of the transfer line before removing it from the container opening.
              (d) Whenever a regulated-material is in a container using Container Level 2 controls, the owner or operator shall install all covers and closure devices for the container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed position except as follows:
              (1) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of adding material to the container as follows:
              (i) In the case when the container is filled to the intended final level in one continuous operation, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling operation.
              (ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material intermittently are added to the container over a period of time, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon either the container being filled to the intended final level, the completion of a batch loading after which no additional material will be added to the container within 15 minutes, the person performing the loading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, or the shutdown of the process generating the material being added to the container, whichever condition occurs first.
              (2) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of removing material from the container as follows:
              (i) For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart may be open to the atmosphere at any time (e.g., covers and closure devices are not required to be secured in the closed position on an empty container).
              (ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are removed from the container but the container does not meet the conditions to be an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal after which no additional material will be removed from the container within 15 minutes or the person performing the unloading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, whichever condition occurs first.

              (3) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed when access inside the container is needed to perform routine activities other than transfer of regulated-material. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to measure the depth of or sample the material in the container, or when a worker needs to open a manhole hatch to access equipment inside the container. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable to the container.
              (4) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the container internal pressure in accordance with the container design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the container internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on container manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the container as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.
              (5) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.
              (e) The owner or operator shall inspect containers using Container Level 2 controls in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.926(a) of this subpart.
              (f) For the purpose of compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, containers shall be used that meet the applicable U.S. DOT regulations on packaging hazardous materials for transportation as follows:
              (1) The container meets the applicable requirements specified in 49 CFR part 178—Specifications for Packagings or 49 CFR part 179—Specifications for Tank Cars.
              (2) Regulated-material is managed in the container in accordance with the applicable requirements specified in 49 CFR part 107 subpart B—Exemptions; 49 CFR part 172—Hazardous Materials Table, Special Provisions, Hazardous Materials Communications, Emergency Response Information, and Training Requirements; 49 CFR part 173—Shippers—General Requirements for Shipments and Packaging; and 49 CFR part 180—Continuing Qualification and Maintenance of Packagings.
              (3) For the purpose of complying with this subpart, no exceptions to the 49 CFR part 178 or part 179 regulations are allowed except as provided for in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
              (4) For a lab pack that is managed in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 178 for the purpose of complying with this subpart, an owner or operator may comply with the exceptions for those packagings specified in 49 CFR 173.12(b).
            
            
              § 63.924
              Standards—Container Level 3 controls.
              (a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and required to control air emissions from containers using Container Level 3 controls.
              (b) A container using Container Level 3 controls is one of the following:
              (1) A container that is vented directly through a closed-vent system to a control device in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) of this section.
              (2) A container that is vented inside an enclosure which is exhausted through a closed-vent system to a control device in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
              (c) The owner or operator shall meet the following requirements as applicable to the type of air emission control equipment selected by the owner or operator:

              (1) The enclosure shall be designed and operated in accordance with the criteria for a permanent total enclosure as specified in “Procedure T—Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total Enclosure” under 40 CFR 52.741, appendix B. The enclosure may have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access; passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means; entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment; or to direct airflow into the enclosure. The owner or operator shall perform the verification procedure for the enclosure as specified in Section 5.0 to “Procedure T—Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total Enclosure” initially when the enclosure is first installed and, thereafter, annually.
              (2) The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of § 63.693.
              (d) Safety devices, as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, may be installed and operated as necessary on any container, enclosure, closed-vent system, or control device used to comply with this section.

              § 63.925
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Procedures for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
              (1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
              (2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
              (3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
              (4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
              (8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.

              (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
              (ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (b) Procedure for determining a container to be vapor-tight for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
              (1) The test shall be performed in accordance with Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A of this chapter.
              (2) A pressure measurement device shall be used that has a precision of ±2.5 mm water and that is capable of measuring above the pressure at which the container is to be tested for vapor tightness.
              (3) If the test results determined by Method 27 indicate that the container sustains a pressure change less than or equal to 750 Pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 Pascals, then the container is determined to be vapor-tight.

              Inspection and monitoring requirements.
              (a) Owners and operators of containers using either Container Level 1 or Container Level 2 controls in accordance with the provisions of § 63.922 and § 63.923 of this subpart, respectively, shall inspect the container and its cover and closure devices as follows:
              (1) In the case when a regulated-material already is in the container at the time the owner or operator first accepts possession of the container at the facility site and the container is not emptied (i.e., does not meet the conditions for an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart) within 24 hours after the container has been accepted at the facility site, the container and its cover and closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position. This inspection of the container must be conducted on or before the date that the container is accepted at the facility (i.e., the date that the container becomes subject to the standards under this subpart). For the purpose of this requirement, the date of acceptance is the date of signature of the facility owner or operator on the manifest or shipping papers accompanying the container. If a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

              (2) In the case when a container filled or partially filled with regulated-material remains unopened at the facility site for a period of 1 year or more, the container and its cover and closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator initially and thereafter, at least once every calendar year, to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position. If a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              
              (3) When a defect is detected for the container, cover, or closure devices, the owner or operator must either empty the regulated-material from the defective container in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section or repair the defective container in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) If the owner or operator elects to empty the regulated-material from the defective container, the owner or operator must remove the regulated-material from the defective container to meet the conditions for an empty container (as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart) and transfer the removed regulated-material to either a container that meets the applicable standards under this subpart or to a tank, process, or treatment unit that meets the applicable standards under the subpart referencing this subpart. Transfer of the regulated-material must be completed no later than 5 calendar days after detection of the defect. The emptied defective container must be either repaired, destroyed, or used for purposes other than management of regulated-material.
              (ii) If the owner or operator elects not to empty the regulated-material from the defective container, the owner or operator must repair the defective container. First efforts at repair of the defect must be made no later than 24 hours after detection and repair must be completed as soon as possible but no later than 5 calendar days after detection. If repair of a defect cannot be completed within 5 calendar days, then the regulated-material must be emptied from the container and the container must not be used to manage regulated-material until the defect is repaired.
              (b) Owners and operators using Container Level 3 controls in accordance with the provisions of § 63.924 of this subpart shall inspect and monitor the closed-vent systems and control devices in accordance with the requirements of § 63.693 in 40 CFR part 63, Subpart DD—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations.

              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from surface impoundments for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for surface impoundments are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart AA—General Provisions do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.941
              Definitions.
              All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
              
                Closure device means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a surface impoundment cover when the device is secured in the closed position. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring loaded pressure relief valve).
              
                Cover means a device or system that provides a continuous barrier over the material managed in a surface impoundment to prevent or reduce air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. A cover may have openings needed for operation, inspection, sampling, maintenance, and repair of the surface impoundment provided that each opening is closed when not in use (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports). Examples of a cover for a surface impoundment include, but are not limited to, a floating membrane cover placed on the surface of the material in the surface impoundment or an air-supported structure installed over the surface impoundment.
              
                No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.944(a) of this subpart.
              
                Regulated-material means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in containers using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
              
                Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
              
                Surface impoundment means a unit that is a natural topographical depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.

              (1) The floating membrane cover shall be designed to float on the liquid surface during normal operations, and form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid.
              (2) The cover shall be fabricated from a synthetic membrane material that is either:
              (i) High density polyethylene (HDPE) with a thickness no less than 2.5 millimeters (mm); or
              (ii) A material or a composite of different materials determined to have both organic permeability properties that are equivalent to those of the material listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and chemical and physical properties that maintain the material integrity for the intended service life of the material.
              (3) The cover shall be installed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between cover section seams or between the interface of the cover edge and its foundation mountings.
              (4) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, each opening in the floating membrane cover shall be equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the cover opening and the closure device.
              (5) The floating membrane cover may be equipped with one or more emergency cover drains for removal of stormwater. Each emergency cover drain shall be equipped with a slotted membrane fabric cover that covers at least 90 percent of the area of the opening or a flexible fabric sleeve seal.
              (6) The closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the cover and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability; the effects of any contact with the liquid and its vapor managed in the surface impoundment; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the surface impoundment on which the floating membrane cover is installed.
              (c) Whenever a regulated-material is in the surface impoundment, the floating membrane cover shall float on the liquid and each closure device shall be secured in the closed position except as follows:

              (1) Opening of closure devices or removal of the cover is allowed at the following times:
              
              (i) To provide access to the surface impoundment for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the surface impoundment, or when a worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly replace the cover and secure the closure device in the closed position, as applicable.
              (ii) To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of surface impoundment.
              (2) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the pressure in the vapor headspace underneath the cover in accordance with the cover design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions as defined in § 63.941 of this subpart when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the cover vapor headspace pressure is within the pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on the cover manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
              (3) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.941 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.
              (d) The owner or operator shall inspect the floating membrane cover in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.946(a) of this subpart.

              Standards—Surface impoundment vented to control device.
              (a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and controlling air emissions from a surface impoundment using a cover and venting the vapor headspace underneath the cover through a closed-vent system to a control device.
              (b) The surface impoundment shall be covered by a cover and vented directly through a closed-vent system to a control device in accordance with the following requirements:
              (1) The cover and its closure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid in the surface impoundment.
              (2) Each opening in the cover not vented to the control device shall be equipped with a closure device. If the pressure in the vapor headspace underneath the cover is less than atmospheric pressure when the control device is operating, the closure devices shall be designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the cover opening and the closure device. If the pressure in the vapor headspace underneath the cover is equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure when the control device is operating, the closure device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions using the procedure specified in § 63.945(a) of this subpart.
              (3) The cover and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the cover and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability; the effects of any contact with the liquid or its vapors managed in the surface impoundment; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the surface impoundment on which the cover is installed.

              (4) The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of § 63.693 in 40 CFR part 63, subpart DD—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant Standards from Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations.
              (c) Whenever a regulated-material is in the surface impoundment, the cover shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed position and the vapor headspace underneath the cover vented to the control device except as follows:
              (1) Venting to the control device is not required, and opening of closure devices or removal of the cover is allowed at the following times:
              (i) To provide access to the surface impoundment for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to sample liquid in the surface impoundment, or when a worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the surface impoundment.
              (ii) To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of surface impoundment.
              (2) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.941 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.

              § 63.945
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
              (1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
              (2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
              (3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
              (4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

              (7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
              (8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
              (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
              (ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.

If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
              
                Closure device means a cap, cover, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening to the individual drain system. Closure devices include devices that are detachable (e.g., a plug or manhole cover), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
              
                Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed in accordance with relevant standards (e.g., ANSI B31-3) and good engineering practices.
              
                Individual drain system means a stationary system used to convey regulated-material to a waste management unit or to discharge or disposal. The term includes hard-piping, all drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes (e.g., manholes, sumps, and lift stations) conveying regulated-material. For the purpose of this subpart, an individual drain system is not a drain and collection system that is designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., stormwater sewer system) and is segregated from all other individual drain systems.
              
                Junction box means a sump, manhole, or access point to a sewer line or a lift station.
              
                Regulated-material means the wastewater streams, residuals, and any other materials specified by the referencing subpart to be managed in accordance with the standards under this subpart.
              
                Sewer line means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other conduit used to convey regulated-material to a downstream waste management unit. Sewer lines include pipes, grates, and trenches.
              
                Waste management unit means the equipment, structure, or device used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of regulated-material. Examples of waste management units include: wastewater tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological wastewater treatment units. Examples of equipment that may be waste management units include containers, air flotation units, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units.
              
                Water seal means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain liquid levels adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a liquid barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The liquid level of the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to be considered a water seal.

              (i) When a water seal is used, the water seal shall be designed such that either:
              (A) The outlet to the pipe discharging the regulated-material extends below the liquid surface in the water seal of the drain; or
              (B) A flexible shield or other device is installed which restricts wind motion across the open space between the outlet of the pipe discharging the regulated material and the drain.
              (ii) When a closure device is used (e.g., securing a cap or plug on a drain that is not receiving regulated-material), the closure device shall be designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the drain opening and the closure device.
              (3) Junction box control requirements. Each junction box shall be equipped with controls as follows:
              (i) The junction box shall be equipped with a closure device (e.g., manhole cover, access hatch) that is designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the junction box opening and the closure device.
              (ii) If the junction box is vented, the junction box shall be vented in accordance with the following requirements:
              (A) The junction box shall be vented through a closed vent system to a control device except as provided for in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. The closed vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with the standards specified in § 63.693.

              (1) The junction box is filled and emptied by gravity flow (i.e., there is no pump) or is operated with no more than slight fluctuations in the liquid level. Large changes in the size of the junction box vapor headspace created by using a pump to repeatedly empty and then refill the junction box do not meet this condition.
              (2) The vent pipe installed on the junction box shall be at least 90 centimeters in length and no greater than 10 centimeters in nominal inside diameter.
              (3) Water seals are installed at the liquid entrance(s) to or exit from the junction box to restrict ventilation in the individual drain system and between components in the individual drain system. The owner or operator shall demonstrate (e.g., by visual inspection or smoke test) upon request by the Administrator that the junction box water seal is properly designed and restricts ventilation.
              (4) Sewer line control requirements. Each sewer line shall not be open to the atmosphere and shall be covered or closed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the sewer line joints, seals, or other emission interfaces.

              § 63.980
              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart include requirements for closed vent systems, control devices and routing of air emissions to a fuel gas system or process. These provisions apply when another subpart references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to a referencing subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (General Provisions) do not apply to this subpart except as specified in a referencing subpart.
            
            
              § 63.981
              Definitions.
              
                Alternative test method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that is not a reference test or equivalent method, and that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, using Method 301 in appendix A of this part 63, or previously approved by the Administrator prior to the promulgation date of standards for an affected source or affected facility under a referencing subpart, to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination that it may be used in place of a test method specified in this subpart.
              
                Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator or a process heater.
              
                By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
              
                Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device. Closed vent system does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck or railcar.
              
                Closed vent system shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a closed vent system or part of a closed vent system consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a closed vent system shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the closed vent system or part of the closed vent system of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled closed vent system shutdown, is not a closed vent system shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not closed vent system shutdowns.
              
                Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion of organic emissions.
              
                Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of process or control system parameters.
              
                Continuous record means documentation, either in hard copy or computer readable form, of data values measured at least once every 15 minutes and recorded at the frequency specified in § 63.998(b).
              
                Control device means, with the exceptions noted below, a combustion device, recovery device, recapture device, or any combination of these devices used to comply with this subpart or a referencing subpart. For process vents from continuous unit operations at affected sources in subcategories where the applicability criteria includes a TRE index value, recovery devices are not considered to be control devices. Primary condensers on steam strippers or fuel gas systems are not considered to be control devices.
              
                Control System means the combination of the closed vent system and the control devices used to collect and control vapors or gases from a regulated emission source.
              
                Day means a calendar day.
              
                Ductwork means a conveyance system such as those commonly used for heating and ventilation systems. It is often made of sheet metal and often has sections connected by screws or crimping. Hard-piping is not ductwork.
              
                Final recovery device means the last recovery device on a process vent stream from a continuous unit operation at an affected source in a subcategory where the applicability criteria includes a TRE index value. The final recovery device usually discharges to a combustion device, recapture device, or directly to the atmosphere.
              
                First attempt at repair, for the purposes of this subpart, means to take action for the purpose of stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to the atmosphere, followed by monitoring as specified in § 63.983(c) to verify whether the leak is repaired, unless the owner or operator determines by other means that the leak is not repaired.
              
                Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler or process heater occupied by the flame envelope.
              
                Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is, or whether the valve position would allow gas flow to be, present in a line.
              
                Fuel gas means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.
              
                Fuel gas system means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous streams generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous streams for use as fuel gas in combustion devices or in-process combustion equipment such as furnaces and gas turbines, either singly or in combination.
              
                Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed using good engineering judgment and standards, such as ANSI B31.3.
              
                High throughput transfer rack means those transfer racks that transfer a total of 11.8 million liters per year or greater of liquid containing regulated material.
              
                Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy recovery section present is not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit with the combustion section; rather, the energy recovery section is a separate section following the combustion section and the two are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas. The above energy recovery section limitation does not apply to an energy recovery section used solely to preheat the incoming vent stream or combustion air.
              
                Low throughput transfer rack means those transfer racks that transfer less than a total of 11.8 million liters per year of liquid containing regulated material.
              
                Operating parameter value means a minimum or maximum value established for a control device parameter which, if achieved by itself or in combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator has complied with an applicable emission limit or operating limit.
              
                Organic monitoring device means a unit of equipment used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photo ionization, or thermal conductivity.

                Performance level means the level at which the regulated material in the gases or vapors vented to a control or recovery device is removed, recovered, or destroyed. Examples of control device performance levels include: achieving a minimum organic reduction efficiency expressed as a percentage of regulated material removed or destroyed in the control device inlet stream on a weight-basis; achieving an organic concentration in the control device exhaust stream that is less than a maximum allowable limit expressed in parts per million by volume on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen if a combustion device is the control device and supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions; or maintaining appropriate control device operating parameters indicative of the device performance at specified values.
              
                Performance test means the collection of data resulting from the execution of a test method (usually three emission test runs) used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant emission limit as specified in the performance test section of this subpart or in the referencing subpart.
              
                Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the principal heat input to a device. To be considered primary, the fuel must be able to sustain operation without the addition of other fuels.
              
                Process heater means an enclosed combustion device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat transfer liquids other than water. A process heater may, as a secondary function, heat water in unfired heat recovery sections.
              
                Recapture device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals, but not normally for use, reuse, or sale. For example, a recapture device may recover chemicals primarily for disposal. Recapture devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, and condensers. For purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart, recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
              
                Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. For purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart, recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
              
                Recovery operations equipment means the equipment used to separate the components of process streams. Recovery operations equipment includes distillation units, condensers, etc. Equipment used for wastewater treatment shall not be considered recovery operations equipment.
              
                Referencing subpart means the subpart which refers an owner or operator to this subpart.

                Repaired, for the purposes of this subpart, means that equipment; is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart; and unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is inspected as specified in § 63.983(c) to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.
              
                Routed to a process or route to a process means the gas streams are conveyed to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process; and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not regulated materials; and/or incorporated into a product; and/or recovered.
              
                Run means one of a series of emission or other measurements needed to determine emissions for a representative operating period or cycle as specified in this subpart. Unless otherwise specified, a run may be either intermittent or continuous within the limits of good engineering practice.
              
                Secondary fuel means a fuel fired through a burner other than the primary fuel burner that provides supplementary heat in addition to the heat provided by the primary fuel.

              Closed vent systems.
              (a) Closed vent system equipment and operating requirements. Except for closed vent systems operated and maintained under negative pressure, the provisions of this paragraph apply to closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a regulated source.
              
              (1) Collection of emissions. Each closed vent system shall be designed and operated to collect the regulated material vapors from the emission point, and to route the collected vapors to a control device.
              (2) Period of operation. Closed vent systems used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions are vented to, or collected by, them.
              (3) Bypass monitoring. Except for equipment needed for safety purposes such as pressure relief devices, low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, and open-ended valves or lines, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of either paragraphs (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section for each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream to the atmosphere.
              (i) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that is capable of taking periodic readings. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.998(d)(1)(ii)(A). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line.

              (i) If the closed vent system is constructed of hard-piping, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
              (A) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section; and
              (B) Conduct annual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks.
              (ii) If the closed vent system is constructed of ductwork, the owner or operator shall conduct an initial and annual inspection according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) Any parts of the closed vent system that are designated, as described in § 63.998(d)(1)(i), as unsafe to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are met.
              (i) The owner or operator determines that the equipment is unsafe-to-inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
              (ii) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practical during safe-to-inspect times. Inspection is not required more than once annually.
              (3) Any parts of the closed vent system that are designated, as described in § 63.998(d)(1)(i), as difficult-to-inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.

              (i) The owner or operator determines that the equipment cannot be inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a support surface; and
              
              (ii) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.

              (i) If a flow indicator is used, take a reading at least once every 15 minutes.
              (ii) If the bypass line valve is secured in the non-diverting position, visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to verify that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position, and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
              (c) Closed vent system inspection procedures. The provisions of this paragraph apply to closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a regulated source.
              (1) Each closed vent system subject to this paragraph shall be inspected according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section.
              (i) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except as specified in this section.
              (ii) Except as provided in (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 must be for the representative composition of the process fluid and not of each individual VOC in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water, or other inerts that are not organic HAP or VOC, the representative stream response factor must be determined on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which the monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
              (iii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria of Method 21 specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (iv) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (v) Calibration gases shall be as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v)(A) through (C) of this section.

              (B) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration less than 10,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
              (C) If the detection instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,500 parts per million.
              (vi) An owner or operator may elect to adjust or not adjust instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects not to adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings shall be compared directly to 500 parts per million to determine whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall measure background concentration using the procedures in this section. The owner or operator shall subtract the background reading from the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument.
              (vii) If the owner or operator elects to adjust for background, the arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared with 500 parts per million for determining whether there is a leak.
              (2) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

              (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, inspections shall be performed when the equipment is in regulated material service, or in use with any other detectable gas or vapor.
              
              (4) Inspections of the closed vent system collecting regulated material from a transfer rack shall be performed only while a tank truck or railcar is being loaded or is otherwise pressurized to normal operating conditions with regulated material or any other detectable gas or vapor.
              (d) Closed vent system leak repair provisions. The provisions of this paragraph apply to closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a regulated source.
              (1) If there are visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks at the time of the annual visual inspections required by paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the owner or operator shall follow the procedure specified in either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator shall eliminate the leak.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million by volume above background or by visual inspections, shall be repaired as soon as practical, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.998(d)(1)(iii) when a leak is detected.
              (i) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 days after the leak is detected.
              (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, repairs shall be completed no later than 15 days after the leak is detected or at the beginning of the next introduction of vapors to the system, whichever is later.
              (3) Delay of repair of a closed vent system for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days after a leak is detected is technically infeasible or unsafe without a closed vent system shutdown, as defined in § 63.981, or if the owner or operator determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment shall be completed as soon as practical, but not later than the end of the next closed vent system shutdown.

An owner or operator may request permission to substitute a prior performance test or compliance assessment by written application to the Administrator as specified in § 63.999(a)(1)(iv).
              (2) Individual performance tests and flare compliance assessments may be waived upon written application to the Administrator, per § 63.999(a)(1)(iii), if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, the source is being operated under an extension or waiver of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension or waiver of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
              (3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notification is given to the owner or operator of the source.
              (c) Performance tests and flare compliance assessments schedule. (1) Unless a waiver of performance testing or flare compliance assessment is obtained under this section or the conditions of a referencing subpart, the owner or operator shall perform such tests as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section.
              (i) Within 180 days after the effective date of a relevant standard for a new source that has an initial start-up date before the effective date of that standard; or
              (ii) Within 180 days after initial start-up for a new source that has an initial start-up date after the effective date of a relevant standard; or
              (iii) Within 180 days after the compliance date specified in a referencing subpart for an existing source, or within 180 days after start-up of an existing source if the source begins operation after the effective date of the relevant emission standard; or
              (iv) Within 180 days after the compliance date for an existing source subject to an emission standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act; or
              (v) Within 180 days after the termination date of the source's extension of compliance or a waiver of compliance for an existing source that obtains an extension of compliance under § 63.1112(a), or waiver of compliance under 40 CFR 61.11; or
              (vi) Within 180 days after the compliance date for a new source, subject to an emission standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act but before the proposal date of the relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(f); or
              (vii) When the promulgated emission standard in a referencing subpart is more stringent than the standard that was proposed, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to that standard for which construction or reconstruction is commenced between the proposal and promulgation dates of the standard shall comply with performance testing requirements within 180 days after the standard's effective date, or within 180 days after start-up of the source, whichever is later. If a promulgated standard in a referencing subpart is more stringent than the proposed standard, the owner or operator may choose to demonstrate compliance initially with either the proposed or the promulgated standard. If the owner or operator chooses to comply with the proposed standard initially, the owner or operator shall conduct a second performance test within 3 years and 180 days after the effective date of the standard, or after start-up of the source, whichever is later, to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated standard.
              (2) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to conduct performance tests and compliance assessments at the regulated source at any time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.
              (3) Unless already permitted by the applicable title V permit, if an owner or operator elects to use a recovery device to replace an existing control device at a later date, or elects to use a different flare, nonflare control device or recovery device to replace an existing flare, nonflare control device or final recovery device at a later date, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, either by amendment of the regulated source's title V permit or, if title V is not applicable, by submission of the notice specified in § 63.999(c)(7) before implementing the change. Upon implementing the change, a compliance demonstration or performance test shall be performed according to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable, within 180 days. The compliance assessment report shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days of completing the determination, as provided in § 63.999(a)(1)(ii).
              (i) For flares used to replace an existing control device, a flare compliance demonstration shall be performed using the methods specified in § 63.987(b);

              (1) General procedures. (i) Continuous unit operations. For continuous unit operations, performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process, unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. During the performance test, an owner or operator may operate the control or halogen reduction device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control or halogen reduction device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction. Operations during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (iii) Combination of both continuous and batch unit operations. For a combination of both continuous and batch unit operations, performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions. For the purpose of conducting a performance test on a combined vent stream, maximum representative operating conditions shall be when batch emission episodes are occurring that result in the highest organic HAP emission rate (for the combined vent stream) that is achievable during the 6-month period that begins 3 months before and ends 3 months after the compliance assessment (e.g. TRE calculation, performance test) without causing any of the situations described in paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Causing damage to equipment;
              (B) Necessitating that the owner or operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or
              (C) Necessitating that the owner or operator make product in excess of demand.
              (iv) Alternatives to performance test requirements. Performance tests shall be conducted and data shall be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures set forth in this subpart, in each relevant standard, and, if required, in applicable appendices of 40 CFR parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 unless the Administrator specifies one of the provisions in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv)(A) through (E) of this section.
              (A) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a test method with minor changes in methodology; or

              (B) Approves the use of an alternative test method, the results of which the Administrator has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific regulated source is in compliance. The alternate method or data shall be validated using the applicable procedures of Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63; or
              (C) Approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors; or
              (D) Waives the requirement for the performance test as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section because the owner or operator of a regulated source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the regulated source is in compliance with the relevant standard; or
              (E) Approves the use of an equivalent method.
              (v) Performance test runs. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(v)(A) and (B) of this section, each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for at least 1 hour and under the conditions specified in this section. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the arithmetic means of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.
              (A) For control devices used to control emissions from transfer racks (except low throughput transfer racks that are capable of continuous vapor processing but do not handle continuous emissions or multiple loading arms of a transfer rack that load simultaneously), each run shall represent at least one complete tank truck or tank car loading period, during which regulated materials are loaded, and samples shall be collected using integrated sampling or grab samples taken at least four times per hour at approximately equal intervals of time, such as 15-minute intervals.
              (B) For intermittent vapor processing systems used for controlling transfer rack emissions (except low throughput transfer racks that do not handle continuous emissions or multiple loading arms of a transfer rack that load simultaneously), each run shall represent at least one complete control device cycle, and samples shall be collected using integrated sampling or grab samples taken at least four times per hour at approximately equal intervals of time, such as 15-minute intervals.
              (2) Specific procedures. Where §§ 63.985 through 63.995 require the owner or operator to conduct a performance test of a control device, or a halogen reduction device, an owner or operator shall conduct that performance test using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable. The regulated material concentration and percent reduction may be measured as either total organic regulated material or as TOC minus methane and ethane according to the procedures specified.

              (ii) Gas volumetric flow rate. The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate.
              (iii) Total organic regulated material or TOC concentration. To determine compliance with a parts per million by volume total organic regulated material or TOC limit, the owner or operator shall use Method 18 or 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as applicable. The ASTM D6420-99 may be used in lieu of Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, under the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(D)(1) through (3) of this section. Alternatively, any other method or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63 may be used. The procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A), (B), (D), and (E) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration. The calculated concentration shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen using the procedures specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section if a combustion device is the control device and supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions.
              (A) Sampling time. For continuous unit operations and for a combination of both continuous and batch unit operations, the minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15 minute intervals during the run.
              (B) Concentration calculation. The concentration of either TOC (minus methane or ethane) or total organic regulated material shall be calculated according to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) (1) or (2) of this section.

                ER29JN99.007
              
              
                ER29JN99.008
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ei, Eo = Mass flow rate of organic compounds at the inlet (i) and outlet (o) of the control device, kilograms per hour.
                n = Number of testing intervals.
                Mij, Moj = Mass of organic compounds at the inlet (i) or outlet (o) during testing interval j, kilograms.
                T = Total time of all testing intervals, hours.
              
              

              (F) To measure inlet and outlet concentrations of total organic regulated material, use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or ASTM D6420-99, under the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(D)(1) through (3) of this section. In conducting the performance test, collect and analyze samples as specified in Method 18 or ASTM D6420-99. You must collect samples simultaneously at the inlet and outlet of the control device. If the performance test is for a combustion control device, you must first determine which regulated material compounds are present in the inlet gas stream (i.e., uncontrolled emissions) using process knowledge or the screening procedure described in Method 18. Quantify the emissions for the regulated material compounds present in the inlet gas stream for both the inlet and outlet gas streams for the combustion device.
              (G) To determine inlet and outlet concentrations of TOC, use Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Measure the total gaseous non-methane organic (TGNMO) concentration of the inlet and outlet vent streams using the procedures of Method 25. Use the TGNMO concentration in Equations 4 and 5 of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.

              (H) Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used instead of Method 25 to measure inlet and outlet concentrations of TOC if the condition in either paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(H)(1) or (2) of this section is met.
              (1) The concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control would result in exhaust TGNMO concentrations of 50 parts per million by volume or less.
              (2) Because of the high efficiency of the control device, the anticipated TGNMO concentration of the control device exhaust is 50 parts per million by volume or less, regardless of the inlet concentration.

              (I) If the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains formaldehyde, you must conduct emissions testing according to paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(I)(1) or (2) of this section.
              (1) If you elect to comply with a percent reduction requirement and formaldehyde is the principal regulated material compound (i.e., greater than 50 percent of the regulated material compounds in the stream by volume), you must use Method 316 or 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, to measure formaldehyde at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Use the percent reduction in formaldehyde as a surrogate for the percent reduction in total regulated material emissions.
              (2) If you elect to comply with an outlet total organic regulated material concentration or TOC concentration limit, and the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains greater than 10 percent (by volume) formaldehyde, you must use Method 316 or 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, to separately determine the formaldehyde concentration. Calculate the total organic regulated material concentration or TOC concentration by totaling the formaldehyde emissions measured using Method 316 or 320 and the other regulated material compound emissions measured using Method 18 or 25/25A.

              (3) An owner or operator using a halogen scrubber or other halogen reduction device to control process vent and transfer rack halogenated vent streams in compliance with a referencing subpart, who is required to conduct a performance test to determine compliance with a control efficiency or emission limit for hydrogen halides and halogens, shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) For an owner or operator determining compliance with the percent reduction of total hydrogen halides and halogens, sampling sites shall be located at the inlet and outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device used to reduce halogen emissions. For an owner or operator determining compliance with a kilogram per hour outlet emission limit for total hydrogen halides and halogens, the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
              (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, Method 26 or Method 26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the concentration, in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter, of total hydrogen halides and halogens that may be present in the vent stream. The mass emissions of each hydrogen halide and halogen compound shall be calculated from the measured concentrations and the gas stream flow rate.
              (iii) To determine compliance with the percent removal efficiency, the mass emissions for any hydrogen halides and halogens present at the inlet of the halogen reduction device shall be summed together. The mass emissions of the compounds present at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device shall be summed together. Percent reduction shall be determined by comparison of the summed inlet and outlet measurements.
              (iv) To demonstrate compliance with a kilogram per hour outlet emission limit, the test results must show that the mass emission rate of total hydrogen halides and halogens measured at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device is below the kilogram per hour outlet emission limit specified in a referencing subpart.

              (2) The pH of the scrubber effluent averaged over the time period of the performance test; and
              (3) The scrubber liquid-to-gas ratio averaged over the time period of the performance test.
              (3) Recovery device monitoring records during TRE index value determination. For process vents that require control of emissions under a referencing subpart, owners or operators using a recovery device to maintain a TRE above a level specified in the referencing subpart shall maintain the continuous records specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable, and submit reports as specified in § 63.999(a)(2)(iii)(C).
              (i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the saturated scrubbing fluid and specific gravity of the scrubbing fluid is greater than or equal to 0.02 specific gravity units, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter that is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation if approved by the Administrator) and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or

              (v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream as specified in a referencing subpart.
              (4) Halogen concentration records. Record the halogen concentration in the vent stream determined according to the procedures specified in a referencing subpart. Submit this record in the Notification of Compliance Status, as specified in § 63.999(b)(4). If the owner or operator designates the vent stream as halogenated, then this shall be recorded and reported in the Notification of Compliance Status report.
              (b) Continuous records and monitoring system data handling—(1) Continuous records. Where this subpart requires a continuous record, the owner or operator shall maintain a record as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable:
              (i) A record of values measured at least once every 15 minutes or each measured value for systems which measure more frequently than once every 15 minutes; or
              (ii) A record of block average values for 15-minute or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period or from at least one measured data value per minute if measured more frequently than once per minute.

              (iii) Where data is collected from an automated continuous parameter monitoring system, the owner or operator may calculate and retain block hourly average values from each 15-minute block average period or from at least one measured value per minute if measured more frequently than once per minute, and discard all but the most recent three valid hours of continuous (15-minute or shorter) records, if the hourly averages do not exclude periods of CPMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CPMS records the measured data and calculates the hourly averages through the use of a computerized data acquisition system.
              (iv) A record as required by an alternative approved under a referencing subpart.
              (2) Excluded data. Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed to determine compliance with an emission limit in a referencing subpart.
              (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, preventive maintenance, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
              (ii) Periods of non-operation of the process unit (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies; and
              (iii) Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions, if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a) and maintains the records specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (3) Records of daily averages. In addition to the records specified in paragraph (a), owners or operators shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section and submit reports as specified in § 63.999(c), unless an alternative recordkeeping system has been requested and approved under a referencing subpart.
              (i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated from data meeting the specifications of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for each operating day and retained for 5 years.
              (A) The daily average shall be calculated as the average of all values for a monitored parameter recorded during the operating day. The average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the period of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous (e.g., for transfer racks the average shall cover periods of loading). If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the daily average instead of all measured values.
              (B) The operating day shall be the period defined in the operating permit or in the Notification of Compliance Status. It may be from midnight to midnight or another daily period.
              (ii) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are within the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or in the operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were within the range and retain this record for 5 years rather than calculating and recording a daily average for that operating day. In such cases, the owner or operator may not discard the recorded values as allowed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (4) [Reserved]
              (5) Alternative recordkeeping. For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment associated with a process vent or transfer rack (except low throughput transfer loading racks), the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section as alternatives to the recordkeeping provisions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator shall retain each record required by paragraphs (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section as provided in a referencing subpart.

              (i) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, and is not required to retain more frequently monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section are met. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status as specified in § 63.999(b)(5) or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of this paragraph, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(iv).
              
              (A) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.

              (B) The monitoring system generates a running average of the monitoring values, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B)(1) through (3) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (1) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;
              (2) The running average is based on at least six one-hour average values; and
              (3) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
              (C) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (D) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.

              (E) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(E)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
              (1) Upon initial installation.
              (2) Annually after initial installation.
              (3) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system that might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.

              (F) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(F)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
              (2) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) through (E) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage; log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in the subpart that references this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(F)(1) of this section.
              (3) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
              (4) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (b)(5)(i)(F)(2) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description shall be retained on-site at all times or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after being superseded. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.
              (ii) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring were required and/or approved by the Administrator.
              (A) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i). The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.
              (B) If there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average value for each operating day, and shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c). The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
              (C) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section for the duration specified in a referencing subpart. For any week, if compliance with paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
              (6)(i) For the purposes of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
              (A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a) and maintains the records specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (B) An excused excursion, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii), does not count toward the number of excursions for the purposes of this subpart.
              (ii) One excused excursion for each control device or recovery device for each semiannual period is allowed. If a source has developed a startup, shutdown and malfunction plan, and a monitored parameter is outside its established range or monitoring data are not collected during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)) or during periods of nonoperation of the process unit or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which monitoring applies), then the excursion is not a violation and, in cases where continuous monitoring is required, the excursion does not count as the excused excursion for determining compliance.
              (c) Nonflare control and recovery device regulated source monitoring records—(1) Monitoring system records. For process vents and high throughput transfer racks, the owner or operator subject to this subpart shall keep the records specified in this paragraph, as well as records specified elsewhere in this subpart.
              
              (i) For a CPMS used to comply with this part, a record of the procedure used for calibrating the CPMS.

              (1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic compounds is greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 °C,
              (2) The total concentration of the pure organic compounds constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 °C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight of the total process stream, and
              (3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.
              
              
                (Note to definition of “In light liquid service”:
                Vapor pressures may be determined by standard reference texts or ASTM D-2879.)

                Initial startup means for new sources, the first time the source begins production. For additions or changes not defined as a new source by this subpart, initial startup means the first time additional or changed equipment is put into operation. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing of equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent startup of process units following malfunction or process unit shutdowns. Except for equipment leaks, initial startup also does not include subsequent startups (of process units following changes in product for flexible operation units or following recharging of equipment in batch unit operations).
              
                Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and smaller, and connectors nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and connectors greater than nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.
              
                Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of liquids dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an existing evaporated drip.
              
                Nonrepairable means that it is technically infeasible to repair a piece of equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process unit or affected facility shutdown.
              
                Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
              
                Organic monitoring device means a unit of equipment used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photo ionization, or thermal conductivity.
              
                Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
              
                Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
              
                Process unit means the equipment specified in the definitions of process unit in the applicable referencing subpart. If the referencing subpart does not define process unit, then for the purposes of this part, process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.
              
                Process unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit, or part of a process unit, consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be affected. The following are not considered process unit shutdowns:
              (1) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for less than 24 hours.
              (2) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that would stop production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit, or part of the process unit, of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown.
              (3) The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production.
              
                Referencing subpart means the subpart which refers an owner or operator to this subpart.
              
                Regulated material, for purposes of this subpart, refers to gases from volatile organic liquids (VOL), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hazardous air pollutants (HAP), or other chemicals or groups of chemicals that are regulated by the referencing subpart.
              
              
                Regulated source for the purposes of this subpart, means the stationary source, the group of stationary sources, or the portion of a stationary source that is regulated by a referencing subpart.
              
                Relief device or valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
              
                Repaired, for the purposes of this subpart means the following:
              (1) Equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart, and
              (2) Equipment, unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in § 63.1004(b) and, as applicable in §§ 63.1004(c) and 63.1015 of this part as appropriate, to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.
              
                Routed to a process or route to a process means the emissions are conveyed to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominantly recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not regulated materials and/or incorporated into a product; and /or recovered.
              
                Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
              
                Screwed (threaded) connector means a threaded pipe fitting where the threads are cut on the pipe wall and the fitting requires only two pieces to make the connection (i.e., the pipe and the fitting).
              
                Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.
              
                Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system operating pressure.
              
                Start-up means the setting into operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.

              § 63.1004
              Instrument and sensory monitoring for leaks.
              (a) Monitoring for leaks. The owner or operator of a regulated source subject to this subpart shall monitor all regulated equipment as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for instrument monitoring and paragraph (a)(2) of this section for sensory monitoring.
              (1) Instrument monitoring for leaks. (i) Valves in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to § 63.1006(b).
              (ii) Pumps in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to § 63.1007(b).
              (iii) Connectors in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to § 63.1008(b).
              (iv) Agitators in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be monitored pursuant to § 63.1009(b).
              (v) Pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service shall be monitored pursuant to § 63.1011(c).
              (vi) Compressors designated to operate with an instrument reading less than 500 parts per million as described in § 63.1003(e), shall be monitored pursuant to § 63.1012(f).
              (2) Sensory monitoring for leaks. (i) Pumps in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to § 63.1007(b)(3) and (e)(1)(v).
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (iii) Agitators in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to § 63.1009(b)(3) or (e)(1)(iv).
              (iv) [Reserved]
              (b) Instrument monitoring methods. Instrument monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.
              (1) Monitoring method. Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (2) Detection instrument performance criteria. (i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid, and not for each individual HAP, VOC or other regulated material individual chemical compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water, or other inerts that are not regulated materials, the representative stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
              (ii) If there is no instrument commercially available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
              (3) Detection instrument calibration procedure. The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              
              (4) Detection instrument calibration gas. Calibration gases shall be zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and a mixture of methane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million; or a mixture of n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air or n-hexane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or n-hexane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more compounds to be measured in air.
              (5) Monitoring performance. Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in regulated material service or is in use with any other detectable material.
              (6) Monitoring data. Monitoring data obtained prior to the regulated source becoming subject to the referencing subpart that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may still be used to initially qualify for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.1006(a)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) for valves provided the departures from the criteria specified or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.1006(b)(3) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every six weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring at a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in the referencing subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
              (c) Instrument monitoring using background adjustments. The owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects not to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. In such case, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1011(b) (pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service) or § 63.1012(f) (compressors). If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
              (1) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section shall apply.
              (2) The background level shall be determined, using the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible (as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
              (4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared to the applicable leak definitions for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1011(b) (pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service) or § 63.1012(f) (compressors).
              (d) Sensory monitoring methods. Sensory monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall consist of detection of a potential leak to the atmosphere by visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method.
              (e) Leaking equipment identification and records. (1) When each leak is detected pursuant to the monitoring specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with the equipment identification, shall be attached to the leaking equipment.
              (2) When each leak is detected, the information specified in § 63.1005(e) shall be recorded and kept pursuant to the referencing subpart.
              [64 FR 34886, June 29, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 63706, Nov. 22, 1999]
            
            
              
              § 63.1005
              Leak repair.
              (a) Leak repair schedule. The owner or operator shall repair each leak detected no later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected. First attempt at repair for pumps includes, but is not limited to, tightening the packing gland nuts and/or ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and temperature. First attempt at repair for valves includes, but is not limited to, tightening the bonnet bolts, and/or replacing the bonnet bolts, and/or tightening the packing gland nuts, and/or injecting lubricant into the lubricated packing.
              (b) Leak identification removal—(1) Valves in gas/vapor and light liquid service. The leak identification on a valve in gas/vapor or light liquid service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in § 63.1006(b), and no leak has been detected during that monitoring. The leak identification on a connector in gas/vapor or light liquid service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in § 63.1008(b) and no leak has been detected during that monitoring.
              (2) Other equipment. The identification that has been placed, pursuant to § 63.1004(e), on equipment determined to have a leak, except for a valve in gas/vapor or light liquid service, may be removed after it is repaired.
              (c) Delay of repair. Delay of repair can be used as specified in any of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the facts that explain any delay of repairs and, where appropriate, why the repair was technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown.
              (1) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a process unit or affected facility shutdown within 15 days after a leak is detected. Repair of this equipment shall occur as soon as practical, but not later than by the end of the next process unit or affected facility shutdown, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
              (2) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in regulated material service.
              (3) Delay of repair for valves, connectors, and agitators is also allowed if the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) are met.
              (i) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and
              (ii) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed, or recovered in a control or recovery device, or routed to a fuel gas system or process complying with § 63.1015 or § 63.1002(b) of this part.
              (4) Delay of repair for pumps is allowed if the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) are met.
              (i) Repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a new system that the owner or operator has determined will provide better performance or one of the specifications of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section are met.
              (A) A dual mechanical seal system that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(1) will be installed,
              (B) A pump that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(2) will be installed; or
              (C) A system that routes emissions to a process or a fuel gas system or a closed vent system and control device that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(3) will be installed.
              (ii) Repair is to be completed as soon as practical, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.

              (5) Delay of repair beyond a process unit or affected facility shutdown will be allowed for a valve if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit or affected facility shutdown, and valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the second process unit or affected facility shutdown will not be allowed unless the third process unit or affected facility shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit or affected facility shutdown.
              (d) Unsafe-to-repair connectors. Any connector that is designated, as described in § 63.1003(d), as an unsafe-to-repair connector is exempt from the requirements of § 63.1008(c), and paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e) Leak repair records. For each leak detected, the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section shall be recorded and maintained pursuant to the referencing subpart.
              (1) The date of first attempt to repair the leak.
              (2) The date of successful repair of the leak.
              (3) Maximum instrument reading measured by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A at the time the leak is successfully repaired or determined to be nonrepairable.
              (4) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak as specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (e)(4)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. The written procedures may be included as part of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, as required by the referencing subpart for the source, or may be part of a separate document that is maintained at the plant site. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.
              (ii) If delay of repair was caused by depletion of stocked parts, there must be documentation that the spare parts were sufficiently stocked on site before depletion and the reason for depletion.
              (5) Dates of process unit or affected facility shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired.
              [64 FR 34886, June 29, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 63706, Nov. 22, 1999]
            
            
              § 63.1006
              Valves in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service standards.
              (a) Compliance schedule. (1) The owner or operator shall comply with this section no later than the compliance dates specified in the referencing subpart.
              (2) The use of monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart to initially qualify for less frequent monitoring is governed by the provisions of § 63.1004(b)(6).
              (b) Leak detection. Unless otherwise specified in § 63.1002(b), or § 63.1016, or in paragraph (e) of this section, or the referencing subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor all valves at the intervals specified in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6) of this section and shall comply with all other provisions of this section.
              (1) Monitoring method. The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.1004(b) and (c).
              (2) Instrument reading that defines a leak. The instrument reading that defines a leak is 10,000 parts per million or greater.
              (3) Monitoring period. (i) Each valve shall be monitored monthly to detect leaks, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(4) of this section. An owner or operator may otherwise elect to comply with one of the alternative standards in paragraphs (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (ii)(A) Any valve for which a leak is not detected for 2 successive months may be monitored the same month (first, second, or third month) of every quarter, beginning with the next quarter, until a leak is detected. The first quarterly monitoring shall occur less than 3 months following the last monthly monitoring.
              (B) If a leak is detected, the valve shall be monitored monthly until a leak is not detected for 2 successive months.
              (C) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, quarter means a 3-month period with the first quarter concluding on the last day of the last full month during the 180 days following initial startup.
              (4) Allowance of alternative standards. An owner or operator may elect to comply with one of the alternatives specified in either paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section if the percentage of valves leaking is equal to or less than 2.0 percent as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section. An owner or operator must notify the Administrator before implementing one of the alternatives specified in either paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section.
              (5) Allowable percentage alternative. An owner or operator choosing to comply with the allowable percentage alternative shall have an allowable percentage of leakers no greater than 2.0 percent for each affected facility or process unit and shall comply with paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
              (i) A compliance demonstration for each affected facility or process unit or affected facility complying with this alternative shall be conducted initially upon designation, annually, and at other times requested by the Administrator. For each such demonstration, all valves in gas and vapor and light liquid service within the affected facility or process unit shall be monitored within 1 week by the methods specified in § 63.1004(b). If an instrument reading exceeds the equipment leak level specified in the referencing subpart, a leak is detected. The leak percentage shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (ii) If an owner or operator decides no longer to comply with this alternative, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator in writing that the work practice standard described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will be followed.
              (6) Skip period alternatives. An owner or operator may elect to comply with one of the alternative work practices specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) or (b)(6)(ii) of this section. An owner or operator electing to use one of these skip period alternatives shall comply with paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) and (b)(6)(iv) of this section. Before using either skip period alternative, the owner or operator shall initially comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart that meets the criteria of either § 63.1004(b)(1) through (b)(5), or § 63.1004(b)(6), may be used to initially qualify for skip period alternatives.
              (i) After 2 consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percent of valves leaking equal to or less than 2.0 as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator may begin to monitor for leaks once every 6 months.
              (ii) After 5 consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percent of valves leaking equal to or less than 2.0 as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator may begin to monitor for leaks once every year.
              (iii) If the percent of valves leaking is greater than 2.0, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, but can elect to comply with paragraph (b)(6) of this section if future percent of valves leaking is again equal to or less than 2.0.
              (iv) The owner or operator shall keep a record of the monitoring schedule and the percent of valves found leaking during each monitoring period.
              (c) Percent leaking valves calculation—calculation basis and procedures. (1) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the compliance date of this subpart, or upon revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking valves on a process unit or group of process units basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the same basis and this shall be the basis used for comparison with the subgrouping criteria specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
              (2) The percent of valves leaking shall be determined by dividing the sum of valves found leaking during current monitoring and valves for which repair has been delayed by the total number of valves subject to the requirements of this section.
              (d) Leak repair. (1) If a leak is determined pursuant to paragraph (b), (e)(1), or (e)(2) of this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the procedures in § 63.1005, as applicable.

              (2) After a leak determined pursuant to paragraph (b) or (e)(2) of this section has been repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least once within the first 3 months after its repair. The monitoring required by this paragraph is in addition to the monitoring required to satisfy the definition of repair.
              (i) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in § 63.1004(b) and (c), as appropriate, to determine whether the valve has resumed leaking.
              (ii) Periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, if the timing of the monitoring period coincides with the time specified in this paragraph. Alternatively, other monitoring may be performed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, regardless of whether the timing of the monitoring period for periodic monitoring coincides with the time specified in this paragraph.
              (iii) If a leak is detected by monitoring that is conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall follow the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, to determine whether that valve must be counted as a leaking valve for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (A) If the owner or operator elected to use periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve.
              (B) If the owner or operator elected to use other monitoring, prior to the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section, to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.
              (e) Special provisions for valves—(1) Unsafe-to-monitor valves. Any valve that is designated, as described in § 63.1003(c)(1), as an unsafe-to-monitor valve, is exempt from the monitoring requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and the owner or operator shall monitor the valve according to the written plan specified in § 63.1003(c)(5).
              (2) Difficult-to-monitor. Any valve that is designated, as described in § 63.1003(c)(2), as a difficult-to-monitor valve, is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and the owner or operator shall monitor the valve according to the written plan specified in § 63.1003(c)(5).
              (3) Less than 250 valves. Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves in regulated material service is exempt from the monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

                Initial startup means for new sources, the first time the source begins production. For additions or changes not defined as a new source by this subpart, initial startup means the first time additional or changed equipment is put into operation. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing of equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent startup of process units following malfunction or process unit shutdowns. Except for equipment leaks, initial startup also does not include subsequent startups (of process units following changes in product for flexible operation units or following recharging of equipment in batch unit operations).
              
                Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and smaller, and connectors nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and connectors greater than nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.

                Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
              
                Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
              
                Process unit means the equipment specified in the definitions of process unit in the applicable referencing subpart. If the referencing subpart does not define process unit, then for the purposes of this part, process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.
              
                Process unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit, or part of a process unit, consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be affected. The following are not considered process unit shutdowns:
              (1) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for less than 24 hours.
              (2) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that would stop production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit, or part of the process unit, of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown.
              (3) The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production.

                Relief device or valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
              
                Repaired, for the purposes of this subpart, means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart and unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in §§ 63.1023(b) and (c) to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.
              
                Routed to a process or route to a process means the emissions are conveyed to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominantly recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not regulated materials and/or incorporated into a product; and/or recovered.
              
                Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
              
                Screwed (threaded) connector means a threaded pipe fitting where the threads are cut on the pipe wall and the fitting requires only two pieces to make the connection (i.e., the pipe and the fitting).
              
                Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.
              
                Set pressure means for the purposes of this subpart, the pressure at which a properly operating pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system operating pressure.
              
                Start-up means the setting into operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.

              (2) Sensory monitoring for leaks. (i) Pumps in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to §§ 63.1026(b)(4) and (e)(1)(v).
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (iii) Agitators in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service shall be observed pursuant to § 63.1028(c)(3) or (e)(1)(iv).
              (iv) [Reserved]
              (b) Instrument monitoring methods. Instrument monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.
              (1) Monitoring method. Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except as otherwise provided in this section.
              (2) Detection instrument performance criteria. (i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2, paragraph (a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water or other inerts that are not HAP or VOC, the representative stream response factor shall be determined on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
              (ii) If there is no instrument commercially available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
              (3) Detection instrument calibration procedure. The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (4) Detection instrument calibration gas. Calibration gases shall be zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and the gases specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration no more than 2,000 parts per million greater than the leak definition concentration of the equipment monitored. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 parts per million above the concentration specified as a leak, and the highest scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately equal to 10,000 parts per million. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, the owner or operator need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.
              (ii) A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
              (5) Monitoring performance. Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in regulated material service or is in use with any other detectable material.
              (6) Monitoring data. Monitoring data obtained prior to the regulated source becoming subject to the referencing subpart that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may still be used to qualify initially for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.1025(a)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) for valves or § 63.1027(b)(3) for connectors provided the departures from the criteria or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.1025(b)(3) or (b)(4) or § 63.1027(b)(3) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every 6 weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2, paragraph (a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring using a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in this subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
              (c) Instrument monitoring using background adjustments. The owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects not to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. In such cases, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1030(b) (pressure relief devices) or § 63.1031(f) (alternative compressor standard). If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
              (1) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section shall apply.
              (2) The background level shall be determined, using the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1030(b) (pressure relief devices) or § 63.1031(f) (alternative compressor standard).
              (d) Sensory monitoring methods. Sensory monitoring consists of visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method used to determine a potential leak to the atmosphere.
              (e) Leaking equipment identification and records. (1) When each leak is detected pursuant to the monitoring specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a weatherproof and readily visible identification, shall be attached to the leaking equipment.
              (2) When each leak is detected, the information specified in § 63.1024(f) shall be recorded and kept pursuant to the referencing subpart, except for the information for connectors complying with the 8 year monitoring period allowed under § 63.1027(b)(3)(iii) shall be kept 5 years beyond the date of its last use.
            
            
              § 63.1024
              Leak repair.
              (a) Leak repair schedule. The owner or operator shall repair each leak detected as soon as practical, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. A first attempt at repair as defined in this subpart shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected. First attempt at repair for pumps includes, but is not limited to, tightening the packing gland nuts and/or ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and temperature. First attempt at repair for valves includes, but is not limited to, tightening the bonnet bolts, and/or replacing the bonnet bolts, and/or tightening the packing gland nuts, and/or injecting lubricant into the lubricated packing.
              (b) [Reserved]
              (c) Leak identification removal—(1) Valves and connectors in gas/vapor and light liquid service. The leak identification on a valve in gas/vapor or light liquid service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in § 63.1025(d)(2), and no leak has been detected during that monitoring. The leak identification on a connector in gas/vapor or light liquid service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in § 63.1027(b)(3)(iv) and no leak has been detected during that monitoring.
              (2) Other equipment. The identification that has been placed, pursuant to § 63.1023(e)(1), on equipment determined to have a leak, except for a valve or for a connector in gas/vapor or light liquid service that is subject to the provisions of § 63.1027(b)(3)(iv), may be removed after it is repaired.
              (d) Delay of repair. Delay of repair is allowed for any of the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the facts that explain any delay of repairs and, where appropriate, why the repair was technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown.
              (1) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days after a leak is detected is technically infeasible without a process unit or affected facility shutdown. Repair of this equipment shall occur as soon as practical, but no later than the end of the next process unit or affected facility shutdown, except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
              (2) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in regulated material service.

              (3) Delay of repair for valves, connectors, and agitators is also allowed if the provisions of paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section are met.
              (i) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and
              (ii) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed, collected and routed to a fuel gas system or process, or recovered in a control device complying with either § 63.1034 or § 63.1021(b) of this part.
              (4) Delay of repair for pumps is also allowed if the provisions of paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(ii) of this section are met.
              (i) Repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a new system that the owner or operator has determined under the provisions of § 63.1035(d) will provide better performance or one of the specifications of paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A) through (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section are met.
              (A) A dual mechanical seal system that meets the requirements of § 63.1026(e)(1) will be installed;
              (B) A pump that meets the requirements of § 63.1026(e)(2) will be installed; or
              (C) A system that routes emissions to a process or a fuel gas system or a closed vent system and control device that meets the requirements of § 63.1026(e)(3) will be installed; and
              (ii) Repair is completed as soon as practical, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.
              (5) Delay of repair beyond a process unit or affected facility shutdown will be allowed for a valve if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit or affected facility shutdown, and valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the second process unit or affected facility shutdown will not be allowed unless the third process unit or affected facility shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit or affected facility shutdown.
              (e) Unsafe-to-repair—connectors. Any connector that is designated, as described in § 63.1022(d), as an unsafe-to-repair connector is exempt from the requirements of § 63.1027(d), and paragraph (a) of this section.
              (f) Leak repair records. For each leak detected, the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section shall be recorded and maintained pursuant to the referencing subpart.

              (i) The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. The written procedures may be included as part of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, as required by the referencing subpart for the source, or may be part of a separate document that is maintained at the plant site. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.
              (ii) If delay of repair was caused by depletion of stocked parts, there must be documentation that the spare parts were sufficiently stocked on-site before depletion and the reason for depletion.
              (5) Dates of process unit or affected facility shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired.
            
            
              § 63.1025
              Valves in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service standards.
              (a) Compliance schedule. (1) The owner or operator shall comply with this section no later than the compliance dates specified in the referencing subpart.

              (2) The use of monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart to qualify initially for less frequent monitoring is governed by the provisions of § 63.1023(b)(6).
              
              (b) Leak detection. Unless otherwise specified in § 63.1021(b) or paragraph (e) of this section, or the referencing subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor all valves at the intervals specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and/or (b)(4) of this section and shall comply with all other provisions of this section.
              (1) Monitoring method. The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.1023(b) and, as applicable, § 63.1023(c).
              (2) Instrument reading that defines a leak. The instrument reading that defines a leak is 500 parts per million or greater.
              (3) Monitoring frequency. The owner or operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(v) of this section and shall keep the record specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.
              (i) If at least the greater of 2 valves or 2 percent of the valves in a process unit leak, as calculated according to paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once per month.
              (ii) At process units with less than the greater of 2 leaking valves or 2 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once each quarter, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) through (b)(3)(v) of this section. Monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart and meeting the criteria of either § 63.1023(b)(1) through (b)(5), or § 63.1023(b)(6), may be used to qualify initially for less frequent monitoring under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) through (b)(3)(v) of this section.
              (iii) At process units with less than 1 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every two quarters
              (iv) At process units with less than 0.5 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every four quarters.
              (v) At process units with less than 0.25 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 2 years.
              (vi) The owner or operator shall keep a record of the monitoring schedule for each process unit.
              (4) Valve subgrouping. For a process unit or a group of process units to which this subpart applies, an owner or operator may choose to subdivide the valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units and apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section to each subgroup. If the owner or operator elects to subdivide the valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units, then the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(viii) of this section apply.
              (i) The overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units to be subdivided shall be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected according to paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section and as calculated according to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) of this section.
              (ii) The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
              (A) The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned to each subgroup. Valves with less than one year of monitoring data or valves not monitored within the last twelve months must be placed initially into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least one year of monitoring data have been obtained.
              (B) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The monitoring results must be included with that less frequently monitored subgroup's associated percent leaking valves calculation for that monitoring event.

              (C) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a less frequently monitored subgroup.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in the next Periodic Report. If the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is 2 percent leaking valves or greater, the owner or operator shall no longer subgroup and shall revert to the program required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section for that applicable process unit or group of process units. An owner or operator can again elect to comply with the valve subgrouping procedures of paragraph (b)(4) of this section if future overall performance of total valves in the process unit or group of process units is again less than 2 percent. The overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units shall be calculated as a weighted average of the percent leaking valves of each subgroup according to Equation number 1:
              
                ER29JN99.010
              
              
                where:
                
                %VLO = Overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units
                %VLi = Percent leaking valves in subgroup i, most recent value calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) of this section.
                Vi = Number of valves in subgroup i.
                n = Number of subgroups.
              
              
              (iv) The owner or operator shall maintain records specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(iv)(A) through (b)(4)(iv)(D) of this section.
              (A) Which valves are assigned to each subgroup,
              (B) Monitoring results and calculations made for each subgroup for each monitoring period,
              (C) Which valves are reassigned, the last monitoring result prior to reassignment, and when they were reassigned, and
              (D) The results of the semiannual overall performance calculation required in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
              (v) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 30 days prior to the beginning of the next monitoring period of the decision to subgroup valves. The notification shall identify the participating process units and the number of valves assigned to each subgroup, if applicable, and may be included in the next Periodic Report.
              (vi) The owner or operator shall submit in the periodic reports the information specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(A) and (b)(4)(vi)(B).
              (A) Total number of valves in each subgroup, and
              (B) Results of the semiannual overall performance calculation required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
              (vii) To determine the monitoring frequency for each subgroup, the calculation procedures of paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be used.
              (viii) Except for the overall performance calculations required by paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section, each subgroup shall be treated as if it were a process unit for the purposes of applying the provisions of this section.
              (c) Percent leaking valves calculation—(1) Calculation basis and procedures. (i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the compliance date of this part or upon revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking valves on a process unit or group of process units basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the same basis and this shall be the basis used for comparison with the subgrouping criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
              (ii) The percent leaking valves for each monitoring period for each process unit or valve subgroup, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER29JN99.011
              
              
                where:
                
                %VL = Percent leaking valves.
                
                VL = Number of valves found leaking, excluding nonrepairable valves, as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and including those valves found leaking pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
                VT = The sum of the total number of valves monitored.
              
              
              (2) Calculation for monitoring frequency. When determining monitoring frequency for each process unit or valve subgroup subject to monthly, quarterly, or semiannual monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last two monitoring periods. When determining monitoring frequency for each process unit or valve subgroup subject to annual or biennial (once every 2 years) monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last three monitoring periods.
              (3) Nonrepairable valves. (i) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified and included in the percent leaking valves calculation in a previous period) up to a maximum of 1 percent of the total number of valves in regulated material service at a process unit or affected facility may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking valves for subsequent monitoring periods.
              (ii) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the total number of valves in regulated material service at a process unit or affected facility, the number of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total number of valves in regulated material service shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves.
              (d) Leak repair. (1) If a leak is determined pursuant to paragraph (b), (e)(1), or (e)(2) of this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the procedures in § 63.1024, as applicable.
              (2) After a leak has been repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least once within the first 3 months after its repair. The monitoring required by this paragraph is in addition to the monitoring required to satisfy the definition of repaired and first attempt at repair.
              (i) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in § 63.1023(b) and (c) of this section, as appropriate, to determine whether the valve has resumed leaking.
              (ii) Periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, if the timing of the monitoring period coincides with the time specified in this paragraph. Alternatively, other monitoring may be performed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, regardless of whether the timing of the monitoring period for periodic monitoring coincides with the time specified in this paragraph.
              (iii) If a leak is detected by monitoring that is conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall follow the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, to determine whether that valve must be counted as a leaking valve for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (A) If the owner or operator elected to use periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve.
              (B) If the owner or operator elected to use other monitoring, prior to the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section, to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.
              (e) Special provisions for valves—(1) Unsafe-to-monitor valves. Any valve that is designated, as described in § 63.1022(c)(1), as an unsafe-to-monitor valve is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d)(2) of this section and the owner or operator shall monitor the valve according to the written plan specified in § 63.1022(c)(4).
              (2) Difficult-to-monitor valves. Any valve that is designated, as described in § 63.1022(c)(2), as a difficult-to-monitor valve is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and the owner or operator shall monitor the valve according to the written plan specified in § 63.1022(c)(4).
              
              (3) Fewer than 250 valves. Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves in regulated material service is exempt from the requirements for monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in regulated material service for leaks once each quarter, as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

              (ii) The owner or operator shall eliminate the visual indications of liquids dripping.
              (c) Percent leaking pumps calculation. (1) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the compliance date of this part or upon revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking pumps on a process unit basis or group of process units basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the same basis.
              (2) If, when calculated on a 6-month rolling average, at least the greater of either 10 percent of the pumps in a process unit or three pumps in a process unit leak, the owner or operator shall implement a quality improvement program for pumps that complies with the requirements of § 63.1035.
              (3) The number of pumps at a process unit or affected facility shall be the sum of all the pumps in regulated material service, except that pumps found leaking in a continuous process unit or affected facility within 1 month after start-up of the pump shall not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one monitoring period only.
              (4) Percent leaking pumps shall be determined by the following equation:
              
                ER29JN99.012
              
              
                Where:
                
                %PL = Percent leaking pumps
                PL = Number of pumps found leaking as determined through monthly monitoring as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Do not include results from inspection of unsafe-to-monitor pumps pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
                PS = Number of pumps leaking within 1 month of start-up during the current monitoring period.
                PT = Total pumps in regulated material service, including those meeting the criteria in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(6) of this section.
              
              
              (d) Leak repair. If a leak is detected pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the procedures in § 63.1024, as applicable, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section for leaks identified by visual indications of liquids dripping.
              (e) Special provisions for pumps—(1) Dual mechanical seal pumps. Each pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, provided the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(viii) of this section are met.
              (i) The owner or operator determines, based on design considerations and operating experience, criteria applicable to the presence and frequency of drips and to the sensor that indicates failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both. The owner or operator shall keep records at the plant of the design criteria and an explanation of the design criteria; and any changes to these criteria and the reasons for the changes. This record must be available for review by an inspector.

              (a) Compliance schedule. The owner or operator shall monitor all connectors in each process unit initially for leaks by the later of either 12 months after the compliance date as specified in a referencing subpart or 12 months after initial startup. If all connectors in each process unit have been monitored for leaks prior to the compliance date specified in the referencing subpart, no initial monitoring is required provided either no process changes have been made since the monitoring or the owner or operator can determine that the results of the monitoring, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. If required to monitor because of a process change, the owner or operator is required to monitor only those connectors involved in the process change.
              (b) Leak detection. Except as allowed in § 63.1021(b), § 63.1036, § 63.1037, or as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors in gas and vapor and light liquid service as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of this section.
              (1) Monitoring method. The connectors shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.1023(b) and, as applicable, § 63.1023(c).
              (2) Instrument reading that defines a leak. If an instrument reading greater than or equal to 500 parts per million is measured, a leak is detected.

The owner or operator shall perform monitoring, subsequent to the initial monitoring required in paragraph (a) of this section, as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this section, and shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iv) and (b)(3)(v) of this section. The required period in which monitoring must be conducted shall be determined from paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this section using the monitoring results from the preceding monitoring period. The percent leaking connectors shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (i) If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was greater than or equal to 0.5 percent, then monitor within 12 months (1 year).
              (ii) If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was greater than or equal to 0.25 percent but less than 0.5 percent, then monitor within 4 years. An owner or operator may comply with the requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the connectors within 2 years of the start of the monitoring period, provided all connectors have been monitored by the end of the 4 year monitoring period.
              (iii) If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was less than 0.25 percent, then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section and either paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) or (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, as appropriate.
              (A) An owner or operator shall monitor at least 50 percent of the connectors within 4 years of the start of the monitoring period.

              (B) If the percent leaking connectors calculated from the monitoring results in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is greater than or equal to 0.35 percent of the monitored connectors, the owner or operator shall monitor as soon as practical, but within the next 6 months, all connectors that have not yet been monitored during the monitoring period. At the conclusion of monitoring, a new monitoring period shall be started pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, based on the percent leaking connectors of the total monitored connectors.
              (C) If the percent leaking connectors calculated from the monitoring results in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is less than 0.35 percent of the monitored connectors, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors that have not yet been monitored within 8 years of the start of the monitoring period.
              (iv) If, during the monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this section, a connector is found to be leaking, it shall be re-monitored once within 90 days after repair to confirm that it is not leaking.
              (v) The owner or operator shall keep a record of the start date and end date of each monitoring period under this section for each process unit.
              (c) Percent leaking connectors calculation. For use in determining the monitoring frequency, as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of this section, the percent leaking connectors as used in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of this section shall be calculated by using equation number 4.

              (iv) The data analysis may be conducted through an inter- or intra-company program (or through some combination of the two approaches) and may be for a single process unit, a plant site, a company, or a group of process units.
              (v) The first analysis of the data shall be completed no later than 18 months after the start of the quality improvement program. The first analysis shall be performed using data collected for a minimum of 6 months. An analysis of the data shall be done each year the process unit or affected facility is in the quality improvement program.
              (6) Trial evaluation program. A trial evaluation program shall be conducted at each plant site for which the data analysis does not identify use of superior performing pump seal technology or pumps that can be applied to the areas identified as having poorer than average performance, except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(v) of this section. The trial program shall be used to evaluate the feasibility of using in the process unit or affected facility (or plant site) the pump designs or seal technologies, and operating and maintenance practices that have been identified by others as having low emission performance.
              (i) The trial evaluation program shall include on-line trials of pump seal technologies or pump designs and operating and maintenance practices that have been identified in the available literature or in analysis by others as having the ability to perform with leak rates below 10 percent in similar services, as having low probability of failure, or as having no external actuating mechanism in contact with the process fluid. If any of the candidate superior performing pump seal technologies or pumps is not included in the performance trials, the reasons for rejecting specific technologies from consideration shall be documented as required in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) The number of pump seal technologies or pumps in the trial evaluation program shall be the lesser of 1 percent or two pumps for programs involving single process units or affected facilities and the lesser of 1 percent or five pumps for programs involving a plant site or groups of process units or affected facilities.

              (iv) The performance trials shall initially be conducted, at least, for a 6-month period beginning not later than 18 months after the start of the quality improvement program. No later than 24 months after the start of the quality improvement program, the owner or operator shall have identified pump seal technologies or pump designs that, combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, operate with low emission performance for specific applications in the process unit or affected facility. The owner or operator shall continue to conduct performance trials as long as no superior performing design or technology has been identified, except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(vi) of this section. The initial list of superior emission performance pump designs or pump seal technologies shall be amended in the future, as appropriate, as additional information and experience are obtained.
              (v) Any plant site with fewer than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with fewer than 100 employees shall be exempt from trial evaluations of pump seals or pump designs. Plant sites exempt from the trial evaluations of pumps shall begin the pump seal or pump replacement program at the start of the fourth year of the quality improvement program.
              (vi) An owner or operator who has conducted performance trials on all alternative superior emission performance technologies suitable for the required applications in the process unit or affected facility may stop conducting performance trials provided that a superior performing design or technology has been demonstrated or there are no technically feasible alternative superior technologies remaining. The owner or operator shall prepare an engineering evaluation documenting the physical, chemical, or engineering basis for the judgment that the superior emission performance technology is technically infeasible or demonstrating that it would not reduce emissions.
              (7) Quality assurance program. Each owner or operator shall prepare and implement a pump quality assurance program that details purchasing specifications and maintenance procedures for all pumps and pump seals in the process unit or affected facility. The quality assurance program may establish any number of categories, or classes, of pumps as needed to distinguish among operating conditions and services associated with poorer than average emission performance as well as those associated with better than average emission performance. The quality assurance program shall be developed considering the findings of the data analysis required under paragraph (d)(5) of this section; and, if applicable, the findings of the trial evaluation required in paragraph (d)(6) of this section; and the operating conditions in the process unit or affected facility. The quality assurance program shall be updated each year as long as the process unit or affected facility has the greater of either 10 percent or more leaking pumps or has three leaking pumps.
              (i) The quality assurance program shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(7)(i)(A) through (d)(7)(i)(D) of this section.

              (B) Require that all equipment orders specify the design standard (or minimum tolerances) for the pump or the pump seal;
              (C) Provide for an audit procedure for quality control of purchased equipment to ensure conformance with purchase specifications. The audit program may be conducted by the owner or operator of the plant site or process unit or affected facility, or by a designated representative; and

              (D) Detail off-line pump maintenance and repair procedures. These procedures shall include provisions to ensure that rebuilt or refurbished pumps and pump seals will meet the design specifications for the pump category and will operate so that emissions are minimized.
              (ii) The quality assurance program shall be established no later than the start of the third year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with 400 or more valves or 100 or more employees; and no later than the start of the fourth year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with less than 400 valves and less than 100 employees.
              (8) Pump or pump seal replacement. Three years after the start of the quality improvement program for plant sites with 400 or more valves or 100 or more employees and at the start of the fourth year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with less than 400 valves and less than 100 employees, the owner or operator shall replace, as described in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) and (d)(8)(ii) of this section, the pumps or pump seals that are not superior emission performance technology with pumps or pump seals that have been identified as superior emission performance technology and that comply with the quality assurance standards for the pump category. Superior emission performance technology is that category or design of pumps or pump seals with emission performance that when combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, will result in less than 10 percent leaking pumps for specific applications in the process unit, affected facility, or plant site. Superior emission performance technology includes material or design changes to the existing pump, pump seal, seal support system, installation of multiple mechanical seals or equivalent, or pump replacement.
              (i) Pumps or pump seals shall be replaced at the rate of 20 percent per year based on the total number of pumps in light liquid service. The calculated value shall be rounded to the nearest nonzero integer value. The minimum number of pumps or pump seals shall be one. Pump replacement shall continue until all pumps subject to the requirements of § 63.1026 are pumps determined to be superior performance technology.
              (ii) The owner or operator may delay replacement of pump seals or pumps with superior technology until the next planned process unit or affected facility shutdown, provided the number of pump seals and pumps replaced is equivalent to the 20 percent or greater annual replacement rate.
              (iii) The pumps shall be maintained as specified in the quality assurance program.
              (e) QIP recordkeeping.

              (a) General requirement. As an alternative to complying with the requirements of §§ 63.1025 through 63.1033 and § 63.1035, an owner or operator of a batch process that operates in regulated material service during the calendar year may comply with one of the standards specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or the owner or operator may petition for approval of an alternative standard under the provisions of § 63.1021(b). The alternative standards of this section provide the options of pressure testing or monitoring the equipment for leaks. The owner or operator may switch among the alternatives provided the change is documented as specified in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
              (b) Pressure testing of the batch equipment. The following requirements shall be met if an owner or operator elects to use pressure testing of batch product-process equipment to demonstrate compliance with this subpart.
              (1) Reconfiguration. Each time equipment is reconfigured for production of a different product or intermediate, the batch product-process equipment train shall be pressure-tested for leaks before regulated material is first fed to the equipment and the equipment is placed in regulated material service.
              (i) When the batch product-process equipment train is reconfigured to produce a different product, pressure testing is required only for the new or disturbed equipment.
              (ii) Each batch product process that operates in regulated material service during a calendar year shall be pressure-tested at least once during that calendar year.
              (iii) Pressure testing is not required for routine seal breaks, such as changing hoses or filters, that are not part of the reconfiguration to produce a different product or intermediate.
              (2) Testing procedures. The batch product process equipment shall be tested either using the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section for pressure vacuum loss or with a liquid using the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
              (3) Leak detection. (i) For pressure or vacuum tests using a gas, a leak is detected if the rate of change in pressure is greater than 6.9 kilopascals (1 pound per square inch gauge) in 1 hour or if there is visible, audible, or olfactory evidence of fluid loss.
              (ii) For pressure tests using a liquid, a leak is detected if there are indications of liquids dripping or if there is other evidence of fluid loss.
              (4) Leak repair. (i) If a leak is detected, it shall be repaired and the batch product-process equipment shall be retested before start-up of the process.
              (ii) If a batch product-process fails the retest (the second of two consecutive pressure tests), it shall be repaired as soon as practical, but not later than 30 calendar days after the second pressure test except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (5) Gas pressure test procedure for pressure or vacuum loss. The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(v) of this section shall be used to pressure test batch product-process equipment for pressure or vacuum loss to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

              (i) The batch product-process equipment train shall be pressurized with a gas to a pressure less than the set pressure of any safety relief devices or valves or to a pressure slightly above the operating pressure of the equipment, or alternatively the equipment shall be placed under a vacuum.
              
              (ii) Once the test pressure is obtained, the gas source or vacuum source shall be shut off.
              (iii) The test shall continue for not less than 15 minutes unless it can be determined in a shorter period of time that the allowable rate of pressure drop or of pressure rise was exceeded. The pressure in the batch product-process equipment shall be measured after the gas or vacuum source is shut off and at the end of the test period. The rate of change in pressure in the batch product-process equipment shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER29JN99.014
              
              
                Where:
                
                Δ (P/t) = Change in pressure, pounds per square inch gauge per hour.
                Pf = Final pressure, pounds per square inch gauge.
                Pi = Initial pressure, pounds per square inch gauge.
                tf − ti = Elapsed time, hours.
              
              
              (iv) The pressure shall be measured using a pressure measurement device (gauge, manometer, or equivalent) that has a precision of ±2.5 millimeter mercury (0.10 inch of mercury) in the range of test pressure and is capable of measuring pressures up to the relief set pressure of the pressure relief device. If such a pressure measurement device is not reasonably available, the owner or operator shall use a pressure measurement device with a precision of at least ±10 percent of the test pressure of the equipment and shall extend the duration of the test for the time necessary to detect a pressure loss or rise that equals a rate of 1 pound per square inch gauge per hour (7 kilopascals per hour).
              (v) An alternative procedure may be used for leak testing the equipment if the owner or operator demonstrates the alternative procedure is capable of detecting a pressure loss or rise.
              (6) Pressure test procedure using test liquid. The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iv) of this section shall be used to pressure-test batch product-process equipment using a liquid to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The batch product-process equipment train, or section of the equipment train, shall be filled with the test liquid (e.g., water, alcohol) until normal operating pressure is obtained. Once the equipment is filled, the liquid source shall be shut off.
              (ii) The test shall be conducted for a period of at least 60 minutes, unless it can be determined in a shorter period of time that the test is a failure.
              (iii) Each seal in the equipment being tested shall be inspected for indications of liquid dripping or other indications of fluid loss. If there are any indications of liquids dripping or of fluid loss, a leak is detected.
              (iv) An alternative procedure may be used for leak testing the equipment, if the owner or operator demonstrates the alternative procedure is capable of detecting losses of fluid.
              (7) Pressure testing recordkeeping. The owner or operator of a batch product process who elects to pressure test the batch product process equipment train to demonstrate compliance with this subpart shall maintain records of the information specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) through (b)(7)(v) of this section.
              (i) The identification of each product, or product code, produced during the calendar year. It is not necessary to identify individual items of equipment in a batch product process equipment train.
              (ii) Physical tagging of the equipment to identify that it is in regulated material service and subject to the provisions of this subpart is not required. Equipment in a batch product process subject to the provisions of this subpart may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by other appropriate methods.
              (iii) The dates of each pressure test required in paragraph (b) of this section, the test pressure, and the pressure drop observed during the test.

              § 63.1040
              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from oil-water separators and organic-water separators for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for oil-water separators and organic-water separators are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.1041
              Definitions.
              All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
              
                Closure device means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a fixed roof or floating roof. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
              
                Continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the edge of the floating roof and the wall of a separator. A continuous seal may be constructed of fastened segments so as to form a continuous seal.
              
                Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a separator in a stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the liquid managed in the separator.
              
                Floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck type cover that rests upon and is supported by the liquid managed in a separator.
              
                Liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled continuous seal that is mounted between the wall of the separator and the floating roof, and the seal is in contact with the liquid in a separator.
              
                Oil-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate oil from water.
              
                Organic-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate organics from water.
              
                Metallic shoe seal means a continuous seal that is constructed of metal sheets which are held vertically against the wall of the separator by springs, weighted levers, or other mechanisms and is connected to the floating roof by braces or other means. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.
              
                No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.1046(a) of this subpart.
              
                Regulated-material means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in separators using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
              
                Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
              
                Separator means a waste management unit, generally a tank, that is used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.

              § 63.1046
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
              (1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
              (2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
              (3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
              (4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

              (7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
              (8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
              (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
              (ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.
              (b) Procedure for performing floating roof seal gap measurements for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
              (1) The owner or operator shall determine the total surface area of gaps in the primary seal and in the secondary seal individually.
              (2) The seal gap measurements shall be performed at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof supports.
              (3) Seal gaps, if any, shall be measured around the entire perimeter of the floating roof in each place where 0.32-centimeter (cm) (1/8 inch) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the separator and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
              (4) For a seal gap measured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the gap surface area shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the separator wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
              (5) The total gap area shall be calculated by adding the gap surface areas determined for each identified gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually, and then dividing the sum for each seal type by the nominal perimeter of the separator basin. These total gap areas for the primary seal and secondary seal then are compared to the respective standards for the seal type as specified in § 63.1043(b)(2) of this subpart.

              § 63.1060
              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from storage vessels for which another subpart references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for storage vessels are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to a referencing subpart. The provisions of subpart A (General Provisions) of this part do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the referencing subpart.
            
            
              § 63.1061
              Definitions.
              All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in this section.
              
                Capacity means the volume of liquid that is capable of being stored in a vessel, determined by multiplying the vessel's internal cross-sectional area by the internal height of the shell.
              
                Deck cover means a device which covers an opening in a floating roof deck. Some deck covers move horizontally relative to the deck (i.e., a sliding cover).
              
                Empty or emptying means the partial or complete removal of stored liquid from a storage vessel. Storage vessels that contain liquid only as wall or bottom clingage, or in pools due to bottom irregularities, are considered completely empty.
              
                External floating roof or EFR means a floating roof located in a storage vessel without a fixed roof.
              
                Fill or filling means the introduction of liquid into a storage vessel, but not necessarily to capacity.
              
                Fixed roof means a roof that is mounted (i.e., permanently affixed) on a storage vessel and that does not move with fluctuations in stored liquid level.
              
                Flexible fabric sleeve seal means a seal made of an elastomeric fabric (or other material) which covers an opening in a floating roof deck, and which allows the penetration of a fixed roof support column. The seal is attached to the rim of the deck opening and extends to the outer surface of the column. The seal is draped (but does not contact the stored liquid) to allow the horizontal movement of the deck relative to the column.
              
                Floating roof means a roof that floats on the surface of the liquid in a storage vessel. A floating roof substantially covers the stored liquid surface (but is not necessarily in contact with the entire surface), and is comprised of a deck, a rim seal, and miscellaneous deck fittings.
              
                Initial fill or initial filling means the first introduction of liquid into a storage vessel that is either newly constructed or has not been in liquid service for a year or longer.
              
                Internal floating roof or IFR means a floating roof located in a storage vessel with a fixed roof. For the purposes of this subpart, an external floating roof located in a storage vessel to which a fixed roof has been added is considered to be an internal floating roof.
              
                Liquid-mounted seal means a resilient or liquid-filled rim seal designed to contact the stored liquid.
              
                Mechanical shoe seal or metallic shoe seal means a rim seal consisting of a band of metal (or other suitable material) as the sliding contact with the wall of the storage vessel, and a fabric seal to close the annular space between the band and the rim of the floating roof deck. The band is typically formed as a series of sheets (shoes) that are overlapped or joined together to form a ring. The lower end of the band extends into the stored liquid.
              
                Pole float means a float located inside a guidepole that floats on the surface of the stored liquid. The rim of the float has a wiper or seal that extends to the inner surface of the pole.
              
                Pole sleeve means a device which extends from either the cover or the rim of an opening in a floating roof deck to the outer surface of a pole that passes through the opening. The sleeve extends into the stored liquid.
              
                Pole wiper means a seal that extends from either the cover or the rim of an opening in a floating roof deck to the outer surface of a pole that passes through the opening.
              
                Referencing subpart means the subpart that refers an owner or operator to this subpart.
              
                Rim seal means a device attached to the rim of a floating roof deck that spans the annular space between the deck and the wall of the storage vessel. When a floating roof has only one such device, it is a primary seal; when there are two seals (one mounted above the other), the lower seal is the primary seal and the upper seal is the secondary seal.
              
                Slotted guidepole means a guidepole or gaugepole that has slots or holes through the wall of the pole. The slots or holes allow the stored liquid to flow into the pole at liquid levels above the lowest operating level.
              
                Storage vessel or Tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.
              
                Vapor-mounted seal means a rim seal designed not to be in contact with the stored liquid. Vapor-mounted seals may include, but are not limited to, resilient seals and flexible wiper seals.
            
            
              § 63.1062
              Storage vessel control requirements.
              (a) For each storage vessel to which this subpart applies, the owner or operator shall comply with one of the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.

If the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, the owner or operator may utilize up to two extensions of up to 30 additional days each. Documentation of a decision to use an extension shall include an explanation of why it was unsafe to perform the inspection, documentation that alternative storage capacity is unavailable, and a schedule of actions that will ensure that the vessel will be emptied as soon as practical.
              (d) Inspection procedure requirements. Floating roof inspections shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section, as applicable. If a floating roof fails an inspection, the owner or operator shall comply with the repair requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
              (1) Floating roof (IFR and EFR) inspections shall be conducted by visually inspecting the floating roof deck, deck fittings, and rim seals from within the storage vessel. The inspection may be performed entirely from the top side of the floating roof, as long as there is visual access to all deck components specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Any of the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(v) of this section constitutes inspection failure.
              (i) Stored liquid on the floating roof.
              (ii) Holes or tears in the primary or secondary seal (if one is present).
              (iii) Floating roof deck, deck fittings, or rim seals that are not functioning as designed (as specified in paragraph (a) of this section).
              (iv) Failure to comply with the operational requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (v) Gaps of more than 0.32 centimeters (1/8 inch) between any deck fitting gasket, seal, or wiper (required by paragraph (a) of this section) and any surface that it is intended to seal.
              (2) Tank-top inspections of IFR's shall be conducted by visually inspecting the floating roof deck, deck fittings, and rim seal through openings in the fixed roof. Any of the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section constitutes inspection failure. Identification of holes or tears in the rim seal is required only for the seal that is visible from the top of the storage vessel.
              (3) Seal gap inspections for EFR's shall determine the presence and size of gaps between the rim seals and the wall of the storage vessel by the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Any exceedance of the gap requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(3)(iii) of this section constitutes inspection failure.
              (i) Rim seals shall be measured for gaps at one or more levels while the EFR is floating, as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) through (d)(3)(i)(F) of this section.
              (A) The inspector shall hold a 0.32 centimeter (1/8 inch) diameter probe vertically against the inside of the storage vessel wall, just above the rim seal, and attempt to slide the probe down between the seal and the vessel wall. Each location where the probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the vessel wall constitutes a gap.

              (B) The length of each gap shall be determined by inserting the probe into the gap (vertically) and sliding the probe along the vessel wall in each direction as far as it will travel freely without binding between the seal and the vessel wall. The circumferential length along which the probe can move freely is the gap length.
              
              (C) The maximum width of each gap shall be determined by inserting probes of various diameters between the seal and the vessel wall. The smallest probe diameter should be 0.32 centimeter, and larger probes should have diameters in increments of 0.32 centimeter. The diameter of the largest probe that can be inserted freely anywhere along the length of the gap is the maximum gap width.
              (D) The average width of each gap shall be determined by averaging the minimum gap width (0.32 centimeter) and the maximum gap width.
              (E) The area of a gap is the product of the gap length and average gap width.
              (F) The ratio of accumulated area of rim seal gaps to storage vessel diameter shall be determined by adding the area of each gap, and dividing the sum by the nominal diameter of the storage vessel. This ratio shall be determined separately for primary and secondary rim seals.
              (ii) The ratio of seal gap area to vessel diameter for the primary seal shall not exceed 212 square centimeters per meter of vessel diameter (10 square inches per foot of vessel diameter), and the maximum gap width shall not exceed 3.81 centimeters (1.5 inches).
              (iii) The ratio of seal gap area to vessel diameter for the secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 square centimeters per meter (1 square inch per foot), and the maximum gap width shall not exceed 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches), except when the secondary seal must be pulled back or removed to inspect the primary seal.
              (e) Repair requirements. Conditions causing inspection failures under paragraph (d) of this section shall be repaired as specified in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
              (1) If the inspection is performed while the storage vessel is not storing liquid, repairs shall be completed before the refilling of the storage vessel with liquid.
              (2) If the inspection is performed while the storage vessel is storing liquid, repairs shall be completed or the vessel removed from service within 45 days. If a repair cannot be completed and the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, the owner or operator may use up to 2 extensions of up to 30 additional days each. Documentation of a decision to use an extension shall include a description of the failure, shall document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable, and shall specify a schedule of actions that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be completely emptied as soon as practical.

            Subpart XX—National Emission Standards for Ethylene Manufacturing Process Units: Heat Exchange Systems and Waste Operations
            
              Source:
              67 FR 46271, July 12, 2002, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              Introduction
              
                § 63.1080
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes requirements for controlling emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from heat exchange systems and waste streams at new and existing ethylene production units.
              
              
                § 63.1081
                When must I comply with the requirements of this subpart?
                You must comply with the requirements of this subpart according to the schedule specified in § 63.1102(a).
              
            
            
              Definitions
              
                § 63.1082
                What definitions do I need to know?
                (a) Unless defined in paragraph (b) of this section, definitions for terms used in this subpart are provided in the Clean Air Act, § 63.1103(e), and 40 CFR 61.341.
                (b) The following definitions apply to terms used in this subpart:
                
                  Continuous butadiene waste stream means the continuously flowing process wastewater from the following equipment: The aqueous drain from the debutanizer reflux drum, water separators on the C4 crude butadiene transfer piping, and the C4 butadiene storage equipment; and spent wash water from the C4 crude butadiene carbonyl wash system. The continuous butadiene waste stream does not include butadiene streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges. The continuous butadiene waste stream does not include butadiene streams from equipment that is currently an affected source subject to the control requirements of another NESHAP. The continuous butadiene waste stream contains less than 10 parts per million by weight (ppmw) of benzene.
                
                  Dilution steam blowdown waste stream means any continuously flowing process wastewater stream resulting from the quench and compression of cracked gas (the cracking furnace effluent) at an ethylene production unit and is discharged from the unit. This stream typically includes the aqueous or oily-water stream that results from condensation of dilution steam (in the cracking furnace quench system), blowdown from dilution steam generation systems, and aqueous streams separated from the process between the cracking furnace and the cracked gas dehydrators. The dilution steam blowdown waste stream does not include dilution steam blowdown streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges. The dilution steam blowdown waste stream also does not include blowdown that has not contacted HAP-containing process materials.
                
                  Heat exchange system means any cooling tower system or once-through cooling water system (e.g., river or pond water). A heat exchange system can include more than one heat exchanger and can include an entire recirculating or once-through cooling system.
                
                  Process wastewater means water which comes in contact with benzene or butadiene during manufacturing or processing operations conducted within an ethylene production unit. Process wastewater is not organic wastes, process fluids, product tank drawdown, cooling water blowdown, steam trap condensate, or landfill leachate. Process wastewater includes direct-contact cooling water.
                
                  Spent caustic waste stream means the continuously flowing process wastewater stream that results from the use of a caustic wash system in an ethylene production unit. A caustic wash system is commonly used at ethylene production units to remove acid gases and sulfur compounds from process streams, typically cracked gas. The spent caustic waste stream does not include spent caustic streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges.
              
            
            
              Applicability for Heat Exchange Systems
              
                § 63.1083
                Does this subpart apply to my heat exchange system?
                The provisions of this subpart apply to your heat exchange system if you own or operate an ethylene production unit expressly referenced to this subpart XX from subpart YY of this part. The provisions of subpart A (General Provisions) of this part do not apply to this subpart except as specified in subpart YY of this part.
              
              
                § 63.1084
                What heat exchange systems are exempt from the requirements of this subpart?
                Your heat exchange system is exempt from the requirements in §§ 63.1085 and 63.1086 if it meets any one of the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
                (a) Your heat exchange system operates with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process side.
                (b) Your heat exchange system contains an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid must serve to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and must not be sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.
                (c) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with an allowable discharge limit of 1 part per million by volume (ppmv) or less above influent concentration, or 10 percent or less above influent concentration, whichever is greater.
                (d) Your once-through heat exchange system is subject to a NPDES permit that meets all of the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.

                (1) The permit requires monitoring of a parameter or condition to detect a leak of process fluids to cooling water.
                
                (2) The permit specifies the normal range of the parameter or condition.
                (3) The permit requires monthly or more frequent monitoring for the parameters selected as leak indicators.
                (4) The permit requires you to report and correct leaks to the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal range.
                (e) Your recirculating or once-through heat exchange system cools process fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart.

                § 63.1085
                What are the general requirements for heat exchange systems?
                Unless you meet one of the requirements for exemptions in § 63.1084, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
                (a) Monitor the cooling water for the presence of substances that indicate a leak according to § 63.1086.
                (b) If you detect a leak, repair it according to § 63.1087 unless repair is delayed according to § 63.1088.
                (c) Keep the records specified in § 63.1089.
                (d) Submit the reports specified in § 63.1090.
              
            
            
              Monitoring Requirements for Heat Exchange Systems
              
                § 63.1086
                How must I monitor for leaks to cooling water?
                You must monitor for leaks to cooling water by monitoring each heat exchange system according to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, monitoring each heat exchanger according to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, or monitoring a surrogate parameter according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If you elect to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may use alternatives in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section for determining the mean entrance concentration.
                (a) Heat exchange system. Monitor cooling water in each heat exchange system for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (either total or speciated) or other representative substances (e.g., total organic carbon or volatile organic compounds (VOC)) that indicate the presence of a leak according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
                (1) You define the equipment that comprises each heat exchange system. For the purposes of implementing paragraph (a) of this section, a heat exchange system may consist of an entire heat exchange system or any combinations of heat exchangers such that, based on the rate of cooling water at the entrance and exit to each heat exchange system and the sensitivity of the test method being used, a leak of 3.06 kg/hr or greater of the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart would be detected. For example, if the test you decide to use has a sensitivity of 1 ppmv for total HAP, you must define the heat exchange system so that the cooling water flow rate is 51,031 liters per minute or less so that a leak of 3.06 kg/hr can be detected.
                (2) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Monitor heat exchange systems at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
                (i) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in either paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.
                (A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.
                (B) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
                (ii) Monitor weekly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.
                (A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.

                (B) If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
                (3) Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the heat exchange system cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. You may validate 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart according to the procedures in appendix D to this part. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.
                (4) Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each entrance and exit.
                (5) Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations, correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 10 percent greater than the entrance mean of the HAP (total or speciated) in Table 1 to this subpart or other representative substance, and the leak is at least 3.06 kg/hr, you have detected a leak.
                (b) Individual heat exchangers. Monitor the cooling water at the entrance and exit of each heat exchanger for the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart (either total or speciated) or other representative substances (e.g., total organic carbon or VOC) that indicate the presence of a leak in a heat exchanger according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Monitor each heat exchanger at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
                (i) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.
                (A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.
                (B) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
                (ii) Monitor weekly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.
                (A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.
                (B) If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
                (2) Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136, as long as the method is sensitive to concentrations as low as 10 ppmv. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. Validation of 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart may be determined according to the provisions of appendix D to this part. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.
                (3) Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each heat exchanger entrance and exit.
                (4) Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations, correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 1 ppmw or 10 percent greater than the entrance mean, whichever is greater, you have detected a leak.
                (c) Surrogate parameters. You may elect to comply with the requirements of this section by monitoring using a surrogate indicator of leaks, provided that you comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity, or other representative indicators.

                (1) You shall prepare and implement a monitoring plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of process fluids into cooling waters. The plan shall require monitoring of one or more process parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
                (i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably indicate the presence of a leak.
                (ii) The parameter level(s) or condition(s) that shall constitute a leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, you have detected a leak.
                (iii) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Monitor heat exchange systems at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.

                (A) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A)(1) or (c)(1)(iii)(A)(2) of this section, as appropriate.
                (1) If no leaks are detected, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.
                (2) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
                (B) Monitor the cooling water weekly for heat exchange systems at new sources.
                (iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with the requirements of this section.
                (2) If a leak is identified by audio, visual, or olfactory inspection, a method listed in 40 CFR part 136, or any other means other than those described in the monitoring plan, and the method(s) specified in the plan could not detect the leak, you shall revise the plan and document the basis for the changes. You shall complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.
                (3) You shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is changed, you must retain the most recent superseded plan for at least 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request.
                (d) Simplifying assumptions for entrance mean concentration. If you are complying with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may elect to determine the entrance mean concentration as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.
                (1) Assume that the entrance mean concentration of the monitored substance is zero; or,
                (2) Determine the entrance mean concentration of a monitored substance at a sampling location anywhere upstream of the heat exchanger or heat exchange system, provided that there is not a reasonable opportunity for the concentration to change at the entrance to each heat exchanger or heat exchange system.

              Repair Requirements for Heat Exchange Systems
              
                § 63.1087
                What actions must I take if a leak is detected?
                If a leak is detected, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section unless repair is delayed according to § 63.1088.
                (a) Repair the leak as soon as practical but not later than 45 calendar days after you received the results of monitoring tests that indicated a leak. You must repair the leak unless you demonstrate that the results are due to a condition other than a leak.

                (b) Once the leak has been repaired, use the monitoring requirements in § 63.1086 within 7 calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later, to confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired.
              
              
                § 63.1088
                In what situations may I delay leak repair, and what actions must I take for delay of repair?
                You may delay the repair of heat exchange systems if the leaking equipment is isolated from the process. You may also delay repair if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, and you meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
                (a) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you are not required to have a special shutdown before that planned shutdown.
                (b) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you may delay repair if a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. You must document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. The documentation process must include the activities in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) State the reason(s) for delaying repair.
                (2) Specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
                (3) Calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) in the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flow rate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger and by the expected duration of the delay.
                (4) Determine emissions of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.

              Background for Waste Requirements
              
                § 63.1091
                What do the waste requirements do?
                This subpart requires you to comply with 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, National Emission Standards for Benzene Waste Operations. There are some differences between the ethylene production waste requirements and those of subpart FF.
              
              
                § 63.1092
                What are the major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the waste requirements for ethylene production sources?
                The major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the requirements for ethylene production sources are listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
                (a) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to all ethylene production sources that are part of a major source. The requirements do not include a provision to exempt sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) from control requirements.
                (b) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to continuous butadiene waste streams which do not contain benzene quantities that would make them subject to the management and treatment requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF.
                (c) The requirements for ethylene production sources do not include the compliance options at 40 CFR 61.342(c)(3)(ii), (d) and (e) for sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 Mg/yr.
                (d) If you transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements in § 63.1096 rather than 40 CFR 61.342(f).
              
            
            
              Applicability for Waste Requirements

                Does this subpart apply to my waste streams?
                The waste stream provisions of this subpart apply to your waste streams if you own or operate an ethylene production facility expressly referenced to this subpart XX from subpart YY of this part. The provisions of subpart A (General Provisions) of this part do not apply to this subpart except as specified in a referencing subpart.
              
              
                § 63.1094
                What waste streams are exempt from the requirements of this subpart?
                The types of waste described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are exempt from this subpart.
                (a) Waste in the form of gases or vapors that is emitted from process fluids.
                (b) Waste that is contained in a segregated storm water sewer system.
              
            
            
              Waste Requirements
              
                § 63.1095
                What specific requirements must I comply with?
                For waste that is not transferred off-site, you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section for continuous butadiene waste streams and paragraph (b) of this section for benzene waste streams. If you transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements of § 63.1096.
                (a) Continuous butadiene waste streams. Manage and treat continuous butadiene waste streams that contain greater than or equal to 10 ppmw 1,3-butadiene and have a flow rate greater than or equal to 0.02 liters per minute, according to either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is less than 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply also.
                (1) Route the continuous butadiene stream to a treatment process or wastewater treatment system used to treat benzene waste streams that complies with the standards specified in 40 CFR 61.348.

                (3) If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is less than 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), comply with the requirements of this section at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, if the startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of the affected source to comply with the requirements of this section and the owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in § 63.1111.
                (b) Waste streams that contain benzene. For waste streams that contain benzene, you must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, except as specified in Table 2 to this subpart. You must manage and treat waste streams that contain benzene as specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
                (1) If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is less than 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), manage and treat spent caustic waste streams and dilution steam blowdown waste streams according to 40 CFR 61.342(c)(1) through (c)(3)(i). The requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, if the startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of the affected source to comply with the requirements of this section and the owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in § 63.1111.
                (2) If the total annual benzene quantity from waste at your facility is greater than or equal to 10 Mg/yr, as determined according to 40 CFR 61.342(a), you must manage and treat waste streams according to any of the options in 40 CFR 61.342(c)(1) through (e) or transfer waste off-site. If you elect to transfer waste off-site, then you must comply with the requirements of § 63.1096.

                § 63.1096
                What requirements must I comply with if I transfer waste off-site?
                If you elect to transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
                (a) Include a notice with the shipment or transport of each waste stream. The notice shall state that the waste stream contains organic HAP that are to be treated in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. When the transport is continuous or ongoing (for example, discharge to a publicly-owned treatment works), the notice shall be submitted to the treatment operator initially and whenever there is a change in the required treatment.

                (b) You may not transfer the waste stream unless the transferee has submitted to the Administrator a written certification that the transferee will manage and treat any waste stream received from a source subject to the requirements of this subpart in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
                (c) By providing this written certification to the Administrator, the certifying entity accepts responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions in this subpart with respect to any shipment of waste covered by the written certification. Failure to abide by any of those provisions with respect to such shipments may result in enforcement action by EPA against the certifying entity in accordance with the enforcement provisions applicable to violations of those provisions by owners or operators of sources.
                (d) The certifying entity may revoke the written certification by sending a written statement to the Administrator and you. The notice of revocation must provide at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions of this subpart. Upon expiration of the notice period, you may not transfer the waste stream to that off-site treatment operation. Written certifications and revocation statements to the Administrator from the transferees of waste shall be signed by the responsible official of the certifying entity, provide the name and address of the certifying entity, and be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional Office at the addresses listed in 40 CFR 63.13. Such written certifications are not transferable by the treater to other off-site waste treatment operators.

              (b) Subpart A requirements. The following provisions of subpart A of this part (General Provisions), §§ 63.1 through 63.5, and §§ 63.12 through 63.15, apply to owners or operators of affected sources subject to this subpart.
              (c) Research and development facilities. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities, consistent with section 112(b)(7) of the Act.
              (d) Primary product determination and applicability. The primary product of a process unit shall be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraphs (d)(3), (4), and (5) of this section discuss compliance for those process units operated as flexible operation units.
              (1) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
              (2) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following the promulgation date for existing affected sources and for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources.
              (i) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for the greatest percentage of operating time over the five-year period, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
              (ii) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest production on a mass basis over the five-year period shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
              (3) Once the primary product of a process unit has been determined to be a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the standards for the primary product production process unit.

              (4) The determination of the primary product for a process unit, including the assessment of applicability of this subpart to process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units, shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4) when the primary product is determined to be a product produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart. The Notification of Compliance Status shall include the information specified in either paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section. If the primary product is determined to be something other than a product produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart, the owner or operator shall retain information, data, and analyses used to document the basis for the determination that the primary product is not produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart.
              
              (i) If the process unit manufactures only one product subject to requirements under this subpart, the identity of that product.
              (ii) If the process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the information specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, as appropriate.
              (A) The identity of the primary product.
              (B) Information concerning operating time and/or production mass for each product that was used to make the determination of the primary product under paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.
              (5) When a flexible operation unit that is subject to this subpart is producing a product other than a product subject to this subpart, or is producing a product subject to this subpart that is not the primary product, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (d)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section for each emission point.
              (i) The owner or operator shall control emissions during the production of all products in accordance with the requirements for the production of the primary product. As appropriate, the owner or operator shall demonstrate that the parameter monitoring level established for the primary product is also appropriate for those periods when products other than the primary product are being produced. Documentation of this demonstration shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
              (ii) The owner or operator shall determine, for the production of each product, whether control is required in accordance with the applicable criteria for the primary product in § 63.1103. If control is required, the owner or operator shall establish separate parameter monitoring levels, as appropriate, for the production of each product. The parameter monitoring levels developed shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
              (e) Storage vessel ownership determination. To determine the process unit to which a storage vessel shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.
              (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date of promulgation for an affected source under the generic MACT, that storage vessel shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
              (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.
              (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit has the predominant use of the storage vessel.)
              (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if only one of those process units is subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.
              (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are subject to standards under this subpart that have different primary products, then the owner or operator shall assign the storage vessel to any one of the process units sharing the storage vessel.

              (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the date of promulgation of standards for an affected source under this subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected utilization for the 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.
              (7) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) another process unit; ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit; or if the applicability of this subpart to a storage vessel has been determined according to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section and there is a significant change in the use of the storage vessel that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel.
              (8) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that includes one or more process units that place material into, or receive materials from, the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a tank farm, the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.
              (ii) If there is only one process unit at a major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
              (iii) If there are two or more process units at the major source that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section.
              (f) Recovery operation equipment ownership determination. To determine the process unit to which recovery equipment shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.
              (1) If recovery operation equipment is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date standards are promulgated for an affected source, that recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
              (2) If recovery operation equipment is used exclusively by a single process unit, the recovery operation shall belong to that process unit.
              (3) If recovery operation equipment is shared among process units, then the recovery operation equipment shall belong to that process unit that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operation equipment (i.e., that process unit has the predominant use of the recovery operation equipment).
              (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process units is a process unit subject to this subpart, the recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to this subpart.
              (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are process units that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the recovery operation equipment to any one of those process units.

              (6) If the predominant use of recovery operation equipment varies from year to year, then the predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date for standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is the more representative of the expected operations for the recovery operations equipment, and based on the expected utilization for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. This determination shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.
              (7) If there is an unexpected change in the utilization of recovery operation equipment that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall redetermine to which process unit the recovery operation belongs by reperforming the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2) through (6) of this section.
              (g) Overlap with other regulations. Paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section specify the applicability of this subpart YY emission point requirements when other rules may apply. Where subpart YY of this part allows an owner or operator an option to comply with one or another regulation to comply with subpart YY of this part, an owner or operator must report which regulation they choose to comply with in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
              (1) Overlap of subpart YY with other regulations for storage vessels. (i) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, a storage vessel subject to this subpart YY that is also subject to subpart G or CC of this part is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart YY.
              (ii) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, a storage vessel that must be controlled according to the requirements of this subpart and subpart Ka or Kb of 40 CFR part 60 is required to comply only with the storage vessel requirements of this subpart.
              (2) Overlap of subpart YY with other regulations for process vents. (i) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, a process vent that must be controlled according to the requirements of this subpart and subpart G of this part is in compliance with this subpart if it complies with either set of requirements. The owner or operator must specify the rule with which they will comply in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
              (ii) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, a process vent that must be controlled according to the requirements of this subpart and subpart III, RRR or NNN of 40 CFR part 60 is required to comply only with the process vent requirements of this subpart.
              (3) Overlap of this subpart YY with other regulations for transfer racks. After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, a transfer rack that must be controlled according to the requirements of this subpart YY and either subpart G of this part or subpart BB of 40 CFR part 61 is required to comply only with the transfer rack requirements of this subpart YY.
              (4) Overlap of subpart YY with other regulations for equipment leaks. (i) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, equipment that must be controlled according to this subpart and 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or 40 CFR part 61, subpart J or subpart V, is required only to comply with the equipment leak requirements of this subpart.
              (ii) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102, equipment that must be controlled according to this subpart and subpart H of this part is in compliance with the equipment leak requirements of this subpart if it complies with either set of requirements. The owner or operator must specify the rule with which they will comply in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
              (5) Overlap of subpart YY with other regulations for wastewater for source categories other than ethylene production. (i) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102 for an affected source subject to this subpart, a wastewater stream that is subject to the wastewater requirements of this subpart and the wastewater requirements of subparts F, G, and H of this part (collectively known as the “HON”) shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart if it complies with either set of requirements. In any instance where a source subject to this subpart is colocated with a Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) source, and a single wastewater treatment facility treats both Group 1 wastewaters and wastewater residuals from the source subject to this subpart and wastewaters from the SOCMI source, a certification by the treatment facility that they will manage and treat the waste in conformity with the specific control requirements set forth in 40 CFR 63.133 through 63.147 will also be deemed sufficient to satisfy the certification requirements for wastewater treatment under this subpart.
              (ii) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102 for an affected source subject to this subpart, a wastewater stream that is subject to control requirements in the Benzene Waste NESHAP (subpart FF of part 61 of this chapter) and this subpart is required to comply with both rules.
              (6) Overlap of subpart YY with other regulations for waste for the ethylene production source category. (i) After the compliance date specified in § 63.1102, a waste stream that is conveyed, stored, or treated in a wastewater stream management unit, waste management unit, or wastewater treatment system that receives streams subject to both the control requirements of § 63.1103(e)(3) for ethylene production sources and the provisions of §§ 63.133 through 63.147 shall comply as specified in paragraphs (g)(6)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. Compliance with the provisions of this paragraph (g)(6)(i) shall constitute compliance with the requirements of this subpart for that waste stream.
              (A) Comply with the provisions in §§ 63.133 through 63.137 and 63.140 for all equipment used in the storage and conveyance of the waste stream.
              (B) Comply with the provisions in §§ 63.1103(e), 63.138, and 63.139 for the treatment and control of the waste stream.
              (C) Comply with the provisions in §§ 63.143 through 63.148 for monitoring and inspections of equipment and for recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The owner or operator is not required to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with the treatment and control requirements in §§ 61.355 through 61.357.
              (ii) After the compliance date specified in § 63.1102, compliance with § 63.1103(e) shall constitute compliance with the Benzene Waste Operations NESHAP (subpart FF of 40 CFR part 61) for waste streams that are subject to both the control requirements of § 63.1103(e)(3) for ethylene production sources and the control requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF.
              [64 FR 34921, June 29, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 63698, 63706, Nov. 22, 1999; 67 FR 46279, July 12, 2002; 70 FR 19272, Apr. 13, 2005; 79 FR 60922, Oct. 8, 2014]
            
            
              § 63.1101
              Definitions.
              All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in the Act, in 40 CFR 63.2 (General Provisions), and in this section. The definitions in this section do not apply to waste requirements for ethylene production sources.
              
                Annual average concentration, as used in the wastewater provisions, means the flow-weighted annual average concentration, as determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.144(b).
              
                Annual average flow rate, as used in the wastewater provisions, means the annual average flow rate, as determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.144(c).
              
                Batch cycle refers to manufacturing a product from start to finish in a batch unit operation.
              
                Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that may be associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode per batch cycle. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with organic HAP will result in a discrete emission episode. If the vessel is then heated, there may also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Both emission episodes may occur during the same batch cycle in the same vessel or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process operations.
              
                Batch unit operation means a unit operation involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment and, in general, involves the emptying of equipment after the batch cycle ceases and prior to beginning a new batch cycle. Mass, temperature, concentration and other properties of the process may vary with time. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not simultaneously occur in a batch unit operation.
              
                Bottoms receiver means a tank that collects distillation bottoms before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.
              
                By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
              
                Capacity means the volume of liquid that is capable of being stored in a storage vessel, determined by multiplying the vessel's internal cross-sectional area by the internal height of the shell.
              
                Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device.

                Acetal resins production means the production of homopolymers and/or copolymers of alternating oxymethylene units. Acetal resins are also known as polyoxymethylenes, polyacetals, and aldehyde resins. Acetal resins are generally produced by polymerizing formaldehyde (HCHO) with the methylene functional group (CH2) and are characterized by repeating oxymethylene units (CH2O) in the polymer backbone.
              
                Back end process vent means any process vent from a continuous unit operation that is not a front end process vent up to the final separation of raw materials and by-products from the stabilized polymer.
              
                Front end process vent means any process vent from a continuous unit operation involved in the purification of formaldehyde feedstock for use in the acetal homopolymer process. All front end process vents are restricted to those vents that occur prior to the polymer reactor.
              (3) Requirements. Table 1 of this section specifies the acetal resins production standards applicability for existing and new sources. Applicability assessment procedures and methods are specified in §§ 63.1104 through 63.1107. An owner or operator of an affected source is not required to perform tests, TRE calculations or other applicability assessment procedures if they opt to comply with the most stringent requirements for an applicable emission point pursuant to this subpart. General compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are specified in §§ 63.1108 through 63.1112. Procedures for approval of alternative means of emission limitations are specified in § 63.1113. The owner or operator must control organic HAP emissions from each affected source emission point by meeting the applicable requirements specified in table 1 of this section.

The provisions of § 63.180(d) also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service.
              
                Modacrylic fiber means a manufactured synthetic fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 35 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units but less than 85 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units.
              
                Seal means, for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources complying with the requirements of § 63.1033(b) or § 63.167(a) on or after October 8, 2014, that instrument monitoring of the open-ended valve or line conducted according to the method specified in § 63.1023(b) and, as applicable, § 63.1023(c), or § 63.180(b) and, as applicable, § 63.180(c), indicates no readings of 500 parts per million or greater.
              
                Spin dope means the liquid mixture of polymer and solvent that is fed to the spinneret to form the acrylic and modacrylic fibers.
              (3) Requirements. An owner or operator of an affected source must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.

                Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipelines or a pipeline and a piece of equipment. A common connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the purposes of this subpart.
              
                Equipment means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system in hydrogen fluoride service; and any control devices or closed-vent systems used to comply with this subpart.
              
                Hydrogen fluoride production means a process engaged in the production and recovery of hydrogen fluoride by reacting calcium fluoride with sulfuric acid. For the purpose of implementing this subpart, hydrogen fluoride production is not a process that produces gaseous hydrogen fluoride for direct reaction with hydrated aluminum to form aluminum fluoride (i.e., the hydrogen fluoride is not recovered as an intermediate or final product prior to reacting with the hydrated aluminum).
              
                In hydrogen fluoride service means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a hydrogen fluoride process fluid (liquid or gas).
              
                In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure.
              
                Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems.
              
                Kiln seal means the mechanical or hydraulic seals at both ends of the kiln, designed to prevent the infiltration of moisture and air through the interface of the rotating kiln and stationary pipes and equipment attached to the kiln during normal vacuum operation of the kiln (operation at an internal pressure of at least 0.25 kilopascal [one inch of water] below ambient pressure).
              
                Leakless pump means a pump whose seals are submerged in liquid, a magnetically-driven pump, a pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system, a canned pump, or other pump that is designed with no externally actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing.
              
                Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to the atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
              
                Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
              
                Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
              
                Relief device or valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
              
                Repaired for the purpose of this regulation means equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak identified by sensory monitoring.
              
                Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
              
                Sensory monitoring means the detection of a potential leak to the atmosphere by walk-through visual, audible, or olfactory monitoring. Comprehensive component-by-component inspection is not required.
              
                Shift means the time a shift operator normally works, typically 8 or 12 hours.
              (3) Requirements. Table 4 of this section specifies the hydrogen fluoride production source category applicability and control requirements for both existing and new sources. The owner or operator must control hydrogen fluoride emissions from each affected source emission point as specified in table 4. General compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are specified in §§ 63.1108 through 63.1112. Specific monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are specified in table 4. Minimization of emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions, including those resulting from kiln seals must be addressed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by § 63.1111; the plan must also establish reporting and recordkeeping of such events. Procedures for approval of alternative means of emission limitations are specified in § 63.1113.

An owner or operator is required to perform sensory monitoring at least once every shift, but no later than within 15 days. When a leak is detected, repair must begin within one hour and be completed as soon as practical. A record shall be kept of each leak detected and repaired including: equipment identification number, date and time the leak was detected and that repair was initiated, and the date of successful repair.
                
              
              (d) Polycarbonate production applicability, definitions, and requirements—(1) Applicability—(i) Affected source. For the polycarbonate production (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) source category, the affected source shall comprise all emission points, in combination, listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, that are part of a polycarbonate production process unit located at a major source as defined in section 112(a) of the Act. For the purposes of this rule, a polycarbonate production process unit is a unit that produces polycarbonate by interfacial polymerization from bisphenols and phosgene. Phosgene production units that are associated with polycarbonate production process units are considered to be part of the polycarbonate production process. A phosgene production unit consists of the reactor in which phosgene is formed and all equipment (listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section) downstream of the reactor that provides phosgene for the production of polycarbonate. Therefore, for the purposes of this rule, such a phosgene production unit is considered to be a polycarbonate production process unit.

                Polycarbonate production means a process engaged in the production of a special class of polyester formed from any dihydroxy compound and any carbonate diester or by ester exchange. Polycarbonate may be produced by solution or emulsion polymerization, although other methods may be used. A typical method for the manufacture of polycarbonate includes the reaction of bisphenol-A with phosgene in the presence of pyridine or other catalyst to form polycarbonate. Methylene chloride or other solvents are used in this polymerization reaction.
              
                Seal means, for polycarbonate production affected sources complying with the requirements of § 63.1033(b) or § 63.167(a) or after October 8, 2014, that instrument monitoring of the open-ended valve or line conducted according to the method specified in § 63.1023(b) and, as applicable, § 63.1023(c), or § 63.180(b) and, as applicable, § 63.180(c), indicates no readings of 500 parts per million or greater.

If raw hydrogen cyanide from the reactor is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is considered to be part of the Andrussow process unit.
              
                Blausaure Methane Anlage (BMA) process unit means a process unit that produces hydrogen cyanide by reacting methane and ammonia over a platinum catalyst. A BMA process unit begins at the point at which raw materials are stored and ends at the point at which refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted as a raw material in a downstream process, burned on-site as a fuel in a boiler or industrial furnace, or is shipped offsite. If raw hydrogen cyanide from the reactor is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is considered to be part of the BMA process unit.
              
                Byproduct means a chemical that is produced coincidentally during the production of another chemical.
              
                Cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit or CCMPU means the equipment assembled and connected by hard-piping or duct work to process raw materials to manufacture, store, and transport a cyanide chemicals product. A cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit shall be limited to any one of the following: an Andrussow process unit, a BMA process unit, a sodium cyanide process unit, or a Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit. For the purpose of this subpart, a cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit includes reactors and associated unit operations; associated recovery devices; and any feed, intermediate and product storage vessels, product transfer racks, and connected ducts and piping. A cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit includes pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, and control devices or systems.
              
                Cyanide chemicals product means either hydrogen cyanide, potassium cyanide, or sodium cyanide which is manufactured as the intended product of a CCMPU or a byproduct of the Sohio process. Other hydrogen cyanide, potassium cyanide, or sodium cyanide byproducts, impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not considered to be cyanide chemicals products.
              
                Dry-end process vent means a process vent originating from the drum filter or any other unit operation in the dry end of a sodium cyanide manufacturing process unit. For the purposes of this subpart, the dry end of the sodium cyanide process unit begins in the unit operation where water is removed from the sodium cyanide, usually in the drum filter, and ends when the sodium cyanide is used as a raw material in a downstream process, or is shipped offsite.
              
                Organic HAP means, for purposes of applicability of the requirements of this subpart, all hydrogen cyanide compounds.

A sodium cyanide process unit begins at the unit operation where refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted with sodium hydroxide and ends at the point the solid sodium cyanide product is shipped offsite or used as a raw material in a downstream process. If raw hydrogen cyanide is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the hydrogen cyanide refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is not considered to be part of the sodium cyanide process unit. For this type of process, the sodium cyanide process unit begins at the point that the aqueous sodium cyanide stream leaves the unit operation where the sodium cyanide is formed. In situations where potassium hydroxide is substituted for sodium hydroxide to produce potassium cyanide, the process unit is still considered a sodium cyanide process unit.
              
                Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit means a process unit that produces hydrogen cyanide as a byproduct of the acrylonitrile production process when acrylonitrile is manufactured using the Sohio process. A Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit begins at the point the hydrogen cyanide leaves the unit operation where the hydrogen cyanide is separated from the acrylonitrile (usually referred to as the heads column). The Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit ends at the point refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted as a raw material in a downstream process, burned on-site as fuel in a boiler or industrial furnace, or is shipped offsite. If raw hydrogen cyanide is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is considered to be part of the Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit.
              
                Wet-end process vent means a process vent originating from the reactor, crystallizer, or any other unit operation in the wet end of the sodium cyanide process unit. For the purposes of this subpart, the wet end of the sodium cyanide process unit begins at the point at which the raw materials are stored and ends just prior to the unit operation where water is removed from the sodium cyanide, usually in the drum filter. Wastewater streams containing discarded wastewater from the sodium cyanide production process are not considered to be part of the wet-end sodium cyanide process. Discarded wastewater that is no longer used in the production process is considered to be process and/or maintenance wastewater. Vents from process and maintenance wastewater operations are not wet-end process vents.
              (3) Requirements. Table 9 to this section specifies the cyanide chemicals manufacturing standards applicable to existing and new sources. Applicability assessment procedures and methods are specified in § 63.1104.

                m = Number of process vents in the process unit that are not controlled by using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
              
              
              (ii) The control efficiency shall be assigned as specified in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section.
              (A) If the process vent is controlled using a flare in accordance with the provisions of § 63.987, or a combustion device in accordance with the provisions of § 63.988(b)(2), for which a performance test has not been conducted, the control efficiency shall be assumed to be 98 weight-percent. For hydrogen-fueled flares, an owner or operator may use a control efficiency greater than 98 weight-percent if they can provide engineering calculations and supporting information demonstrating a greater control efficiency.
              (B) If the process vent is controlled using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device for which a performance test has been conducted in accordance with the provisions of § 63.997, the control efficiency shall be the efficiency determined by the performance test.
              (5) Source category specific modifications to testing procedures. (i) When identifying equipment subject to any equipment leak requirements, an owner or operator is allowed to designate specific components of such equipment as never being safe to monitor with their Notification of Compliance Status report and periodic compliance reports. In order for an owner or operator to designate such equipment as never being safe to monitor, they must certify that monitoring such equipment at any time the CCMPU is operating is never safe (e.g., monitoring this equipment would present an unreasonable hazard or preclude testing personnel from meeting emergency evacuation requirements). If it is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction that equipment designated by the owner or operator as never safe to monitor is appropriately designated, an owner or operator will not be required to monitor such equipment.
              (ii) For process vent hydrogen cyanide emissions that are vented to a control device other than a flare during startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the design evaluation must include documentation that the control device being used achieves the required control efficiency during the reasonably expected maximum flow rate and emission rate during startup, shutdown, and malfunction.

              (iii) If a facility controls process vent emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction by using a flare, an owner or operator is not required to perform flow rate and heat content testing as specified in § 63.987(b)(3)(ii) and (iii). In lieu of performing flow rate and heat content testing, an owner or operator is required to submit engineering calculations that substantiate that a flare meets the applicable heat content or flow rates, or provide data from a compliance assessment that the flare is in compliance under worst case conditions (e.g., maximum operating conditions).
              
              (iv) If flare velocity and net heating value testing, as specified in § 63.11(b)(6)(ii) and (b)(7)(i), would create an unreasonable hazard for testing personnel, an owner or operator is allowed to submit engineering calculations that substantiate vent stream velocity and heat content of a flare in lieu of test data. These calculations are required to be submitted with the facilities' compliance test notification report for approval by the Administrator.
              (v) The data from any performance test method used to measure HCN concentrations must be validated using EPA Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A).

              § 63.1104
              Process vents from continuous unit operations: applicability assessment procedures and methods.
              (a) General. The provisions of this section provide calculation and measurement methods for criteria that are required by § 63.1103 to be used to determine applicability of the control requirements for process vents from continuous unit operations. The owner or operator of a process vent is not required to determine the criteria specified for a process vent that is being controlled (including control by flare) in accordance with the applicable weight-percent, TOC concentration, or organic HAP concentration requirement in § 63.1103.
              (b) Sampling sites. For purposes of determining process vent applicability criteria, the sampling site shall be located as specified in (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.
              (1) Sampling site location if TRE determination is required. If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 includes a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, heating value, and TRE index value, shall be after the final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present, and prior to release to the atmosphere.
              (2) Sampling site location if TRE determination is not required. If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 does not include a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, and any other specified parameter shall be at the exit from the unit operation before any control device.
              (3) Sampling site selection method. Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process vents smaller than 0.10 meter (0.33 foot) in nominal inside diameter.
              (4) Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a combustion device. An owner or operator using a scrubber to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion control device in compliance with § 63.1103 (as appropriate) shall determine the halogen atom mass emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (c) Applicability assessment requirement. The TOC or organic HAP concentrations, process vent volumetric flow rates, process vent heating values, process vent TOC or organic HAP emission rates, halogenated process vent determinations, process vent TRE index values, and engineering assessments for process vent control applicability assessment requirements are to be determined during maximum representative operating conditions for the process, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, operations during periods of malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test. For all other affected sources, operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test.
              (d) Exceptions. For a process vent stream that consists of at least one process vent from a batch unit operation manifolded with at least one process vent from a continuous unit operation, the TRE shall be calculated during periods when one or more batch emission episodes are occurring that result in the highest organic HAP emission rate (in the combined vent stream that is being routed to the recovery device) that is achievable during the 6-month period that begins 3 months before and ends 3 months after the TRE calculation, without causing any of the situations described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) to occur.
              (1) Causing damage to equipment;
              (2) Necessitating that the owner or operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or
              (3) Necessitating that the owner or operator make product in excess of demand.
              (e) TOC or Organic HAP concentration. The TOC or organic HAP concentrations shall be determined based on paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or (k) of this section, or any other method or data that have been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. For concentrations needed for comparison with the appropriate control applicability concentrations specified in § 63.1103, TOC or organic HAP concentration shall be determined based on paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or (k) of this section or any other method or data that has been validated according to the protocol in method 301 of appendix A of this part. The owner or operator shall record the TOC or organic HAP concentration as specified in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
              (1) Method 18. The procedures specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration using method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A:
              (i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.
              (ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or regulated organic HAP emissions shall be calculated according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.

              § 63.1107
              Equipment leaks.

              (a) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used.
              (b) An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              (c) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.
              (d) Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.
              (e) Requirements for pressure relief devices. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator of an acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected source or polycarbonate production affected source must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.
              (1) Operating requirements. Except during a pressure release event, operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A.
              (2) Pressure release requirements. For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service, the owner or operator must comply with either paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section following a pressure release, as applicable.
              (i) If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, except as provided in § 63.171 or § 63.1024(d), as applicable.
              (ii) If the pressure relief device consists of or includes a rupture disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release, except as provided in § 63.171 or § 63.1024(d), as applicable.
              (3) Pressure release management. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, emissions of organic HAP to the atmosphere from pressure relief devices in organic HAP service are prohibited, and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.
              (i) The owner or operator must equip each pressure relief device in organic HAP service with a device(s) or parameter monitoring system that is capable of:
              (A) Identifying the pressure release;
              (B) Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and

              (C) Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the pressure relief device itself or may be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.
              (ii) If any pressure relief device in organic HAP service releases to atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, the owner or operator must calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each pressure release event and report this quantity as required in paragraph (g) of this section. Calculations may be based on data from the pressure relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter monitoring data and process knowledge.
              (4) Pressure relief devices routed to a control device, process, fuel gas system, or drain system. If a pressure relief device in organic HAP service is designed and operated to route all HAP emissions from pressure releases through a closed vent system to a control device or to a process, fuel gas system, or drain system, the owner or operator is not required to comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), or (3) (if applicable) of this section for that pressure relief device. The fuel gas system or closed vent system and control device (if applicable) must meet the requirements of § 63.172 or § 63.1034, as applicable (except that the term “pressure relief devices” shall apply instead of the term “equipment leaks” in § 63.1034). The drain system (if applicable) must meet the requirements of § 63.136.
              (f) Recordkeeping requirements. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, for pressure relief devices in organic HAP service, keep records of the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section, as applicable.
              (1) A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices that vent to a fuel gas system, process, drain system, or closed-vent system and control device, under the provisions in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
              (2) A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices subject to the provisions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
              (3) A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices equipped with rupture disks, under the provisions in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (4) The dates and results of the monitoring following a pressure release for each pressure relief device subject to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. The results shall include:
              (i) The background level measured during each compliance test.
              (ii) The maximum instrument reading measured at each piece of equipment during each compliance test.
              (5) For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service subject to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, keep records of each pressure release to the atmosphere, including the following information:
              (i) The source, nature, and cause of the pressure release.
              (ii) The date, time, and duration of the pressure release.
              (iii) An estimate of the quantity of total HAP emitted during the pressure release and the calculations used for determining this quantity.
              (iv) The actions taken to prevent this pressure release.
              (v) The measures adopted to prevent future such pressure releases.
              (g) Periodic reports. For owners or operators of an acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected source or polycarbonate production affected source subject to paragraph (e) of this section, Periodic Reports must include the information specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.
              (1) For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service subject to paragraph (e) of this section, report confirmation that all monitoring to show compliance was conducted within the reporting period.

              (2) For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, report any instrument reading of 500 ppm above background or greater, more than 5 days after the relief device returns to organic HAP gas or vapor service after a pressure release.
              (3) For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service subject to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, report each pressure release to the atmosphere, including the following information:
              (i) The source, nature, and cause of the pressure release.
              (ii) The date, time, and duration of the pressure release.
              (iii) An estimate of the quantity of total HAP emitted during the pressure release and the method used for determining this quantity.

              § 63.1108
              Compliance with standards and operation and maintenance requirements.
              (a) Requirements. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (5) of this section apply to all affected sources except acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. The requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(3), (6), and (7) of this section apply to all affected sources.
              (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. However, if a startup, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart and any of the subparts that are referenced by this subpart during startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation.
              (2) If equipment leak requirements are referenced by this subpart for a subject source category, such requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, process unit shutdown (as defined in § 63.1101), or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.
              (3) For batch unit operations, shutdown does not include the normal periods between batch cycles; and startup does not include the recharging of batch unit operations, or the transitional conditions due to changes in product.
              (4)(i) For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. Equipment leak requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.
              (ii) General duty. At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (5) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission standards of this subpart and the subparts referenced by this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (if applicable), and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if available. Compliance with an inadequate startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan developed pursuant to § 63.1111 is not a shield for failing to comply with good operation and maintenance requirements.
              (6) Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practical after their occurrence.
              (7) Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable, independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.
              (b) Compliance assessment procedures—(1) Parameter monitoring: compliance with operating conditions. Compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices may be determined by, but is not limited to, the parameter monitoring data for emission points that are required to perform continuous monitoring. For each excursion, except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions.
              (i) An excursion that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not a violation.
              (ii) Excused excursions are not allowed for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources or polycarbonate production affected sources. For all other affected sources, an excused excursion, as described in § 63.998(b)(6)(ii), is not a violation.
              (2) Parameter monitoring: Excursions. An excursion is not a violation in cases where continuous monitoring is required and the excursion does not count toward the number of excused excursions (as described in § 63.998(b)(6)(ii)), if the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are met, except that the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section do not apply for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
              (i) During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)), or
              (ii) During periods of non-operation of the affected source or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).
              (3) Operation and maintenance procedures. Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator. This information may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan under § 63.1111), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source, and alternatives approved as specified in § 63.1113.
              (4) Applicability and compliance assessment procedures. Applicability and compliance with standards shall be governed by, in part, but not limited to, the use of data, tests, and requirements according to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. Compliance with design, equipment, work practice, and operating standards, including those for equipment leaks, shall be determined according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
              
              (i) Applicability assessments. Unless otherwise specified in a relevant test method required to assess control applicability, each test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in this subpart. The arithmetic mean of the results of the three runs shall apply when assessing applicability. Upon receiving approval from the Administrator, results of a test run may be replaced with results of an additional test run if it meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.
              (A) A sample is accidentally lost after the testing team leaves the site; or
              (B) Conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown; or
              (C) Extreme meteorological conditions occur;
              (D) Other circumstances occur that are beyond the owner or operator's control.
              (ii) Performance test. (A) The Administrator may determine compliance with emission limitations of this subpart based on, but not limited to, the results of performance tests conducted according to the procedures specified in § 63.997, unless otherwise specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
              (B) For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (iii) Operation and maintenance requirements. The Administrator may determine compliance with the operation and maintenance standards of this subpart by, but not limited to, evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
              (5) Design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards. The Administrator may determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational requirements by, but is not limited to, review of records, inspection of the affected source, and by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements as specified in this subpart, and in the subparts referenced by this subpart.
              (c) Finding of compliance. The Administrator may make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with an emission standard or operating and maintenance requirement as specified in, but not limited to, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, upon obtaining all of the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable) and any information available to the Administrator to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used. Standards in this subpart and methods of determining compliance are in metric units followed by the equivalents in English units. The Administrator will make findings of compliance with the numerical standards of this subpart using metric units.
              (d) Compliance time. All terms that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually), unless specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.

              (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified for completion of required tasks, time periods may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in § 63.1110(h). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
              (2) When the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
              (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or
              (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.
              (3) In all instances where a provision requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

              (3) The address (physical location) of the reporting facility.
              (4) Identification of each affected source covered in the submission and identification of the subparts (this subpart and the subparts referenced in this subpart) that are applicable to that affected source. Summaries and groupings of this information are permitted.
              (g) Report and notification submission—(1) Submission to the Environmental Protection Agency. All reports and notifications required under this subpart shall be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional Office and to the delegated State authority, except that request for permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation as provided for in § 63.1113 shall be submitted to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, MD-10, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27711. The EPA Regional Office may waive the requirement to submit a copy of any reports or notifications at its discretion.
              (2) Submission of copies. If any State requires a notice that contains all the information required in a report or notification listed in this subpart, an owner or operator may send the appropriate EPA Regional Office a copy of the report or notification sent to the State to satisfy the requirements of this subpart for that report or notification.
              (3) Method of submission. Wherever this subpart specifies “postmark” dates, submittals may be sent by methods other than the U.S. Mail (e.g., by fax or courier). Submittals shall be sent on or before the specified date.
              (4) Submission by electronic media. If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of an affected source, reports may be submitted on electronic media.
              (h) Adjustment to timing of submittals and review of required communications—(1) Alignment with title V submission. An owner or operator may submit Periodic Reports required by this subpart on the same schedule as the title V periodic report for the facility. The owner or operator using this option need not obtain prior approval, but must ensure that no reporting gaps occur. The owner or operator shall clearly identify the change in reporting schedule in the first report filed under this paragraph. The requirements of paragraph (f) of this section are not waived when implementing this change.
              (2) Establishment of a common schedule. An owner or operator may arrange by mutual agreement (which may be a standing agreement) with the Administrator a common schedule on which periodic reports required by this subpart shall be submitted throughout the year as long as the reporting period is not extended. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraphs (h)(3) through (7) of this section.
              (3) Submission requirements. Except as allowed by paragraph (h)(1) of this section, until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source remains strictly subject to the required submittal deadlines specified in this subpart and subparts referenced by this subpart.
              (4) Request for adjustment of reporting schedule. Except as allowed by paragraph (h)(1) of this section, an owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this subpart or subparts referenced by this subpart. A request for a change to the periodic reporting schedule need only be made once for every schedule change and not once for every semiannual report submitted.
              (5) Alteration of time periods or deadlines. Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this subpart for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practical before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
              (6) Approval of request for adjustment. If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.
              (7) Notification of delay. If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.

              § 63.1111
              Startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
              (a) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. The requirements of this paragraph (a) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.
              (1) Description and purpose of plan. The owner or operator of an affected source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. This plan shall also include a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with relevant standards under this subpart. The plan shall also address routine or otherwise predictable CPMS malfunctions. This plan shall be developed by the owner or operator by the affected source's compliance date under this subpart. The requirement to develop this plan shall be incorporated into the source's title V permit. This requirement is optional for equipment that must comply with subparts TT or UU under this subpart. It is not optional for equipment equipped with a closed vent system and control device subject to this subpart and subpart SS of this part. The purpose of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence, in order to minimize excess emissions of regulated organic HAP; and
              (ii) To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).
              (2) Operation of source. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart YY shall operate and maintain such affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (3) Use of additional procedures. To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator of an affected source may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.
              (4) Revisions to the plan. Based on the results of a determination made under § 63.1108(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section:
              (i) Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the affected source that has occurred; or
              (ii) Fails to provide for the operation of the affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or
              (iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or
              (iv) Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified in § 63.1108(a)(5).
              (5) Additional malfunction plan requirements. If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control equipment or CPMS.
              (b) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements. The requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.
              (1) Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements. If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction of an affected source, or of a control device or monitoring system required for compliance (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, then the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. During the reporting period, reports shall only be required for startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions during which excess emissions, as defined in § 63.1108(a)(5), occur during the reporting period. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction report can be submitted as part of a Periodic Report required under § 63.1110(a)(5), or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise under this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the affected source's title V permit. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate), unless the information is submitted with the Periodic Report. The report shall include the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
              (i) The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official certifying its accuracy.
              (ii) The number of startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period if the total duration amounts to either of the durations in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. Records of the number of CPMS startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period are required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section.
              (A) Total duration of periods of malfunctioning of a CPMS equal to or greater than 5 percent of that CPMS operating time for the reporting period; or
              (B) Total duration of periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for an affected source equal to or greater than 1 percent of that affected source's operating time for the reporting period.
              (iii) Records documenting each startup, shutdown and malfunction event as required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(F).

              (iv) Records documenting the total duration of operating time as required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(H).
              
              (2) Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports. Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) during which excess emissions occur is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph shall contain the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred. Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph are specified in § 63.1110(h).
              (c) Malfunction recordkeeping and reporting. The requirements of this paragraph (c) apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.
              (1) Records of malfunctions. The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, time, and duration of each failure.
              (ii) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
              (iii) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1108(a)(4)(ii), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.
              (2) Reports of malfunctions. If a source fails to meet an applicable standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time and duration of each failure. For each failure the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.

              § 63.1112
              Extension of compliance, and performance test, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting waivers and alternatives.
              (a) Extension of compliance—(1) Extension of compliance with emission standards. Until an extension of compliance has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart.
              (2) Extension of compliance for early reductions and other reductions. (i) Early reductions. Pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants in accordance with the provisions of subpart D of this part, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with specific requirements of this part, as specified in subpart D of this part.
              (ii) Other reductions. Pursuant to section 112(i)(6) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source has installed best available control technology (BACT) (as defined in section 169(3) of the Act) or technology required to meet a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) (as defined in section 171 of the Act) prior to the promulgation of an emission standard in this part applicable to such source and the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) controlled pursuant to the BACT or LAER installation, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with such emission standard that will apply until the date 5 years after the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator.
              (3) Request for extension of compliance. Paragraphs (a)(4) through (7) of this section concern requests for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this part (except requests for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section will be handled through procedures specified in subpart D of this part).
              (4) Requests for extensions of compliance for section 112 standards. (i) Section 112(d) standards. (A) The owner or operator of an existing source who is unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. The owner or operator of an affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.
              (B) Any request under this paragraph for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority not later than 12 months before the affected source's compliance date (as specified in § 63.1102) for sources that are not including emission points in an emissions average, or not later than 18 months before the affected source's compliance date (as specified in § 63.1102) for sources that are including emission points in an emissions average. Emission standards established under this part may specify alternative dates for the submittal of requests for an extension of compliance if alternatives are appropriate for the source categories affected by those standards, e.g., a compliance date specified by the standard is less than 12 (or 18) months after the standard's effective date.
              (ii) Section 112(f) standards. The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 2 years after the standard's effective date to comply with the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he/she finds that such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls and that steps will be taken during the period of the extension to assure that the health of persons will be protected from imminent endangerment. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 15 days after the effective date of the relevant standard.
              (5) Requests for extensions of compliance for BACT or LAER. The owner or operator of an existing source who has installed BACT or technology required to meet LAER (as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) prior to the promulgation of a relevant emission standard in this part may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source 5 years from the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator, to comply with the standard. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 120 days after the promulgation date of the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he or she finds that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
              (6) Contents of request. (i) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall include the following information:
              (A) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard;
              (B) A compliance schedule, including the date by which each step toward compliance will be reached. At a minimum, the list of dates shall include:
              (1) The date by which contracts for emission control systems or process changes for emission control will be awarded, or the date by which orders will be issued for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process changes;
              (2) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is to be initiated;
              (3) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is to be completed; and
              (4) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved.
              (C) A description of interim emission control steps, that will be taken during the extension period, including milestones to assure proper operation and maintenance of emission control and process equipment; and
              (D) Whether the owner or operator is also requesting an extension of other applicable requirements (e.g., performance testing requirements).
              (ii) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall include all information needed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
              (7) Additional advice. Advice on requesting an extension of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator.
              (8) Approval of request for extension of compliance. Paragraphs (a)(9) through (14) of this section concern approval of an extension of compliance requested under paragraphs (a)(4) through (6) of this section.
              (9) General. Based on the information provided in any request made under paragraphs (a)(4) through (6) of this section, or other information, the Administrator may grant an extension of compliance with an emission standard, as specified in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section.

              (B) Under paragraph (a)(5)of this section, specify any additional conditions that the Administrator deems necessary to assure the proper operation and maintenance of the installed controls during the extension period.
              (11) Progress reports. The owner or operator of an existing source that has been granted an extension of compliance under paragraph (a)(10) of this section may be required to submit to the Administrator progress reports indicating whether the steps toward compliance outlined in the compliance schedule have been reached. The contents of the progress reports and the dates by which they shall be submitted will be specified in the written extension of compliance granted under paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
              (12) Notifications to owners and operators regarding compliance extensions for section 112(d) standards. (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (a)(5) of this section. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 days after receipt of the original application and within 30 days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.
              (ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
              (iii) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the request.
              (iv) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
              (13) Notifications to owners and operators regarding compliance extensions for section 112(f) standards. (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 15 days after receipt of the original application and within 15 days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.
              (ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 15 days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
              (iii) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the request.

              (iv) A final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
              
              (14) Termination of extension. The Administrator may terminate an extension of compliance at an earlier date than specified if any specification under paragraphs (a)(10)(iii) or (iv) of this section is not met.
              (15) [Reserved]
              (16) Administrator's authority. The granting of an extension under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.
              (b) Waiver of performance tests—(1) Applicability of this section. Until a waiver of a performance testing requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.
              (2) General. Individual performance tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
              (3) Request to waive a performance test. (i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested or if the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if a site-specific test plan is not submitted.
              (ii) If an application for a waiver of a subsequent performance test is made, the application may accompany any required compliance progress report, compliance status report, or excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report, but it shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if a site-specific test plan is not submitted.
              (iii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source performing the required test.
              (4) Approval of request to waive performance test. The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of a performance test made under paragraph (b)(3) of this section when he/she—
              (i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section; or
              (ii) Approves or disapproves a site-specific test plan; or
              (iii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
              (iv) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
              (5) Administrator's authority. Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.
              (c) Use of an alternative monitoring method—(1) General. Until permission to use an alternative monitoring method has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.
              (2) Alternatives to monitoring methods. After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring methods or procedures of this part including, but not limited to, the following:

              (i) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a CMS specified by a relevant standard would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances within the effluent gases;
              
              (ii) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected source is infrequently operated;
              (iii) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate CEMS that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions;
              (iv) Alternative locations for installing CMS when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements;
              (v) Alternate methods for converting pollutant concentration measurements to units of the relevant standard;
              (vi) Alternate procedures for performing daily checks of zero (low-level) and high-level drift that do not involve use of high-level gases or test cells;
              (vii) Alternatives to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test methods or sampling procedures specified by any relevant standard;
              (viii) Alternative CMS that do not meet the design or performance requirements in this part, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between their measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements as specified in the relevant standard. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected source; or
              (ix) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected source or the combined effluent from two or more affected sources is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.
              (3) Conflicts between alternative and required methods. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, requirement, or procedure, the Administrator may require the use of a method, requirement, or procedure specified in this section or in the relevant standard. If the results of the specified and alternative method, requirement, or procedure do not agree, the results obtained by the specified method, requirement, or procedure shall prevail.
              (4)(i) Request to use alternative monitoring method. An owner or operator who wishes to use an alternative monitoring method shall submit an application to the Administrator as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The application may be submitted at any time provided that the monitoring method is not used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard or other requirement. If the alternative monitoring method is to be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard, the application shall be submitted not later than with the site-specific test plan required, or with the site-specific performance evaluation plan (if requested), or at least 60 days before the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin.
              (ii) The application shall contain a description of the proposed alternative monitoring system and a performance evaluation test plan, if required. In addition, the application shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for an alternative monitoring method, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source using the required method.
              (iii) The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the submittal dates specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the compliance demonstration date specified in this section or the relevant standard.
              (5) Approval of request to use alternative monitoring method. (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the request to use an alternative monitoring method within 30 days after receipt of the original request and within 30 days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. Before disapproving any request to use an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and

              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the Administrator notifies the applicant of his or her intention to disapprove the request, the Administrator will specify how much time the owner or operator will have after being notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional information.
              (ii) The Administrator may establish general procedures and criteria in a relevant standard to accomplish the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.
              (iii) If the Administrator approves the use of an alternative monitoring method for an affected source under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative monitoring method until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another monitoring method as allowed by this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
              (6) Alternative to the relative accuracy test. An alternative to the relative accuracy test for CEMS specified in a relevant standard may be requested as follows:
              (i) Criteria for approval of alternative procedures. An alternative to the test method for determining relative accuracy is available for affected sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. The owner or operator of an affected source may petition the Administrator under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section to substitute the relative accuracy test in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 with the procedures in section 10 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements specified in this subpart or subpart referenced by this subpart demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the relevant standard is less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator to substitute the relative accuracy test with the procedures in section 10 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the CEMS is used continuously to determine compliance with the relevant standard.
              (ii) Petition to use alternative to relative accuracy test. The petition to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied, the location and the procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative relative accuracy materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure(s). The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The Administrator's determination to approve an alternative will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2.
              (iii) Rescission of approval to use alternative to relative accuracy test. The Administrator will review the permission to use an alternative to the CEMS relative accuracy test and may rescind such permission if the CEMS data from a successful completion of the alternative relative accuracy procedure indicate that the affected source's emissions are approaching the level of the relevant standard. The criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the relevant standard for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. The owner or operator of the affected source shall maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion for permission to use an alternative for relative accuracy testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 7 of Performance Specification 2.
              (d) Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements. (1) Until a waiver of a recordkeeping or reporting requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart and any subparts referenced by this subpart.
              (2) Recordkeeping or reporting requirements may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the affected source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or the source is operating under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
              (3) If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, any required compliance progress report or compliance status report required under this part or in the source's title V permit, or an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required under § 63.999(c) or another subpart referenced by this subpart, whichever is applicable. The application shall include whatever information the owner or operator considers useful to convince the Administrator that a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is warranted.
              (4) The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this paragraph when he/she—
              (i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section; or
              (ii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required Notification of Compliance Status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
              (iii) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
              (5) A waiver of any recordkeeping or reporting requirement granted under this paragraph may be conditioned on other recordkeeping or reporting requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator.
              (6) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.
            
            
              § 63.1113
              Procedures for approval of alternative means of emission limitation.
              (a) Alternative means of emission limitation. An owner or operator of an affected source may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards of this subpart or of a subpart referenced by this subpart. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (but not performance standards) in this subpart, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.
              (1) The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (2) Any such notice shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (b) Content of submittal. (1) In order to obtain approval, any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions. An owner or operator of an affected source seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance who has not previously performed testing shall also submit a proposed test plan. If the owner or operator seeks permission to use an alternative means of compliance based on previously performed testing, they shall submit the results of testing, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.
              (2) The owner or operator who requests an alternative means of emissions limitation shall submit a description of the proposed testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting that will be used and the proposed basis for demonstrating compliance.
              (3) For storage vessels, the owner or operator shall include the results of actual emissions tests using full-size or scale-model storage vessels that accurately collect and measure all regulated HAP emissions using a given control technique, and that accurately simulate wind and account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure, or an engineering analysis that the Administrator determines to be an accurate method of determining equivalence.
              (4) For proposed alternatives to equipment leak requirements referenced by this subpart, the owner or operator shall also submit the information specified in and meet the requirements for alternate means of emission limitation specified in the referenced subparts.
            
            
              § 63.1114
              Implementation and enforcement.
              (a) This subpart can be implemented and enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or a delegated authority such as the applicable State, local, or tribal agency. If the EPA Administrator has delegated authority to a State, local, or tribal agency, then that agency has the authority to implement and enforce this subpart. Contact the applicable EPA Regional Office to find out if this subpart is delegated to a State, local, or tribal agency.
              (b) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority of this subpart to a State, local, or tribal agency under 40 CFR part 63, subpart E, the authorities contained in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section are retained by the EPA Administrator and are not transferred to the State, local, or tribal agency.
              (1) Approval of alternatives to the nonopacity emissions standards in § 63.1103(a)(3), (b)(3) through (5), (c)(3), (d)(3), (e)(3), (f)(3), (g)(3) and (4), and (h)(3) under § 63.6(g). Follow the requirements in § 63.1113 to request permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation. Where these standards reference another subpart, the cited provisions will be delegated according to the delegation provisions of the referenced subpart.
              (2) [Reserved]

            Subpart CCC—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Steel Pickling—HCl Process Facilities and Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration Plants
            
              Source:
              64 FR 33218, June 22, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 63.1155
              Applicability.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to the following facilities and plants that are major sources for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) or are parts of facilities that are major sources for HAP:
              (1) All new and existing steel pickling facilities that pickle carbon steel using hydrochloric acid solution that contains 6 percent or more by weight HCl and is at a temperature of 100 °F or higher; and

              (2) All new and existing hydrochloric acid regeneration plants.
              
              (3) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to facilities that pickle carbon steel without using hydrochloric acid, to facilities that pickle only specialty steel, or to acid regeneration plants that regenerate only acids other than hydrochloric acid.
              (b) For the purposes of implementing this subpart, the affected sources at a facility or plant subject to this subpart are as follows: Continuous and batch pickling lines, hydrochloric acid regeneration plants, and hydrochloric acid storage vessels.
              (c) Table 1 to this subpart specifies the provisions of this part 63, subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of steel pickling facilities and hydrochloric acid regeneration plants subject to this subpart.
              (d) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator must timely meet the reporting requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (i) The violation was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when exceeded violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
              (iv) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (vii) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (2) Report. The owner of operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmation defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.

              Definitions.
              Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:
              
                Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or a defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
              
                Batch pickling line means the collection of equipment and tanks configured for pickling metal in any form but usually in discrete shapes where the material is lowered in batches into a bath of acid solution, allowed to remain until the scale is dissolved, then removed from the solution, drained, and rinsed by spraying or immersion in one or more rinse tanks to remove residual acid.
              
                Carbon steel means steel that contains approximately 2 percent or less carbon, 1.65 percent or less manganese, 0.6 percent or less silicon, and 0.6 percent or less copper.
              
                Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and that is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport emissions from a process unit or piece of equipment (e.g., pumps, pressure relief devices, sampling connections, open-ended valves or lines, connectors, and instrumentation systems) back into a closed system or into any device that is capable of reducing or collecting emissions.

              Compliance dates and maintenance requirements.
              (a) Compliance dates. (1) The owner or operator of an affected existing steel pickling facility and/or hydrochloric acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart shall achieve initial compliance with the requirements of this subpart no later than June 22, 2001.
              (2) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed steel pickling facility and/or hydrochloric acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart that commences construction or reconstruction after September 18, 1997, shall achieve compliance with the requirements of this subpart immediately upon startup of operations or by June 22, 1999, whichever is later.
              (b) Maintenance requirements. (1) The owner or operator shall prepare an operation and maintenance plan for each emission control device to be implemented no later than the compliance date. The plan shall be incorporated by reference into the source's title V permit. All such plans must be consistent with good maintenance practices, and, for a scrubber emission control device, must at a minimum:
              (i) Require monitoring and recording the pressure drop across the scrubber once per shift while the scrubber is operating in order to identify changes that may indicate a need for maintenance;
              (ii) Require the manufacturer's recommended maintenance at the recommended intervals on fresh solvent pumps, recirculating pumps, discharge pumps, and other liquid pumps, in addition to exhaust system and scrubber fans and motors associated with those pumps and fans;
              (iii) Require cleaning of the scrubber internals and mist eliminators at intervals sufficient to prevent buildup of solids or other fouling;
              (iv) Require an inspection of each scrubber at intervals of no less than 3 months with:
              (A) Cleaning or replacement of any plugged spray nozzles or other liquid delivery devices;
              (B) Repair or replacement of missing, misaligned, or damaged baffles, trays, or other internal components;

              (E) Adjustment of damper settings for consistency with the required air flow.
              (v) If the scrubber is not equipped with a viewport or access hatch allowing visual inspection, alternate means of inspection approved by the Administrator may be used.
              (vi) The owner or operator shall initiate procedures for corrective action within 1 working day of detection of an operating problem and complete all corrective actions as soon as practicable. Procedures to be initiated are the applicable actions that are specified in the maintenance plan. Failure to initiate or provide appropriate repair, replacement, or other corrective action is a violation of the maintenance requirement of this subpart.
              (vii) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of each inspection, including each item identified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, that is signed by the responsible maintenance official and that shows the date of each inspection, the problem identified, a description of the repair, replacement, or other corrective action taken, and the date of the repair, replacement, or other corrective action taken.
              (2) The owner or operator of each hydrochloric acid regeneration plant shall develop and implement a written maintenance program. The program shall require:
              (i) Performance of the manufacturer's recommended maintenance at the recommended intervals on all required systems and components;

              § 63.1161
              Performance testing and test methods.
              (a) Demonstration of compliance. The owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test for each process or emission control device to determine and demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limitation according to the requirements in § 63.7 of subpart A of this part and in this section. Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (b) Establishment of scrubber operating parameters. During the performance test for each emission control device, the owner or operator using a wet scrubber to achieve compliance shall establish site-specific operating parameter values for the minimum scrubber makeup water flow rate and, for scrubbers that operate with recirculation, the minimum recirculation water flow rate. During the emission test, each operating parameter must be monitored continuously and recorded with sufficient frequency to establish a representative average value for that parameter, but no less frequently than once every 15 minutes. The owner or operator shall determine the operating parameter monitoring values as the averages of the values recorded during any of the runs for which results are used to establish the emission concentration or collection efficiency per paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish alternative compliant operating parameter values. Also, an owner or operator may reestablish compliant operating parameter values as part of any performance test that is conducted subsequent to the initial test or tests.
              (c) Establishment of hydrochloric acid regeneration plant operating parameters. (1) During the performance test for hydrochloric acid regeneration plants, the owner or operator shall establish site-specific operating parameter values for the minimum process offgas temperature and the maximum proportion of excess air fed to the process as described in § 63.1162(b)(1) of this subpart. During the emission test, each operating parameter must be monitored and recorded with sufficient frequency to establish a representative average value for that parameter, but no less frequently than once every 15 minutes for parameters that are monitored continuously. Amount of iron in the spent pickle liquor shall be determined for each run by sampling the liquor every 15 minutes and analyzing a composite of the samples. The owner or operator shall determine the compliant monitoring values as the averages of the values recorded during any of the runs for which results are used to establish the emission concentration per paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish alternative compliant operating parameter values. Also, an owner or operator may reestablish compliant operating parameter values as part of any performance test that is conducted subsequent to the initial test or tests.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (d) Test methods. (1) The following test methods in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine compliance under §§ 63.1157(a), 63.1157(b), 63.1158(a), and 63.1158(b) of this subpart:
              (i) Method 1, to determine the number and location of sampling points, with the exception that no traverse point shall be within one inch of the stack or duct wall;
              (ii) Method 2, to determine gas velocity and volumetric flow rate;
              (iii) Method 3, to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas;
              (iv) Method 4, to determine the moisture content of the stack gas; and

              (v) Method 26A, “Determination of Hydrogen Halide and Halogen Emissions from Stationary Sources—Isokinetic Method,” to determine the HCl mass flows at the inlet and outlet of a control device or the concentration of HCl discharged to the atmosphere, and also to determine the concentration of Cl2 discharged to the atmosphere from acid regeneration plants. If compliance with a collection efficiency standard is being demonstrated, inlet and outlet measurements shall be performed simultaneously. The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 60 minutes and the minimum sample volume 0.85 dry standard cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). The concentrations of HCl and Cl2 shall be calculated for each run as follows:
              
              CHCl (ppmv) = 0.659 CHCl (mg/dscm),
              and CC12 (ppmv) = 0.339 CC12 (mg/dscm),
              
              
                where C(ppmv) is concentration in ppmv and C(mg/dscm) is concentration in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter as calculated by the procedure given in Method 26A.
              
              
              (2) The owner or operator may use equivalent alternative measurement methods approved by the Administrator.

              § 63.1162
              Monitoring requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of a new, reconstructed, or existing steel pickling facility or acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart shall:
              (1) Conduct performance tests to measure the HCl mass flows at the control device inlet and outlet or the concentration of HCl exiting the control device according to the procedures described in § 63.1161 of this subpart. Performance tests shall be conducted either annually or according to an alternative schedule that is approved by the applicable permitting authority, but no less frequently than every 21/2 years or twice per title V permit term. If any performance test shows that the HCl emission limitation is being exceeded, then the owner or operator is in violation of the emission limit.
              (2) In addition to conducting performance tests, if a wet scrubber is used as the emission control device, install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the scrubber makeup water flow rate and, if required, recirculation water flow rate. These flow rates must be monitored continuously and recorded at least once per shift while the scrubber is operating. Operation of the wet scrubber with excursions of scrubber makeup water flow rate and recirculation water flow rate less than the minimum values established during the performance test or tests will require initiation of corrective action as specified by the maintenance requirements in § 63.1160(b)(2) of this subpart.
              (3) If an emission control device other than a wet scrubber is used, install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the appropriate operating parameters.
              (4) Failure to record each of the operating parameters listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is a violation of the monitoring requirements of this subpart.
              (5) Each monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 5 percent and shall be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but not less frequently than once per year.
              (6) The owner or operator may develop and implement alternative monitoring requirements subject to approval by the Administrator.
              (b) The owner or operator of a new, reconstructed, or existing acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart shall also install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the:
              (1) Process offgas temperature, which shall be monitored continuously and recorded at least once every shift while the facility is operating in production mode; and
              (2) Parameters from which proportion of excess air is determined. Proportion of excess air shall be determined by a combination of total air flow rate, fuel flow rate, spent pickle liquor addition rate, and amount of iron in the spent pickle liquor, or by any other combination of parameters approved by the Administrator in accordance with § 63.8(f) of subpart A of this part. Proportion of excess air shall be determined and recorded at least once every shift while the plant is operating in production mode.
              (3) Each monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 5 percent and must be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but not less frequently than once per year.

              (4) Operation of the plant with the process offgas temperature lower than the value established during performance testing or with the proportion of excess air greater than the value established during performance testing is a violation of the operational standard specified in § 63.1159(a) of this subpart.
              (c) The owner or operator of an affected hydrochloric acid storage vessel shall inspect each vessel semiannually to determine that the closed-vent system and either the air pollution control device or the enclosed loading and unloading line, whichever is applicable, are installed and operating when required.

              § 63.1175
              What is the purpose of this subpart?
              This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants emitted from existing, new, and reconstructed cupolas and curing ovens at facilities that produce mineral wool.
            
            
              § 63.1176
              Where can I find definitions of key words used in this subpart?
              The definitions of key words used in this subpart are in the Clean Air Act (Act), in § 63.2 of the general provisions in subpart A of this part, and in § 63.1196 of this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.1177
              Am I subject to this subpart?
              You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an existing, new, or reconstructed mineral wool production facility that is located at a plant site that is a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions, meaning the plant emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAPs at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
            
            
              Standards
              
                § 63.1178
                For cupolas, what standards must I meet?
                (a) You must control emissions from each cupola as specified in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (b) You must meet the following operating limits for each cupola:
                (1) Begin within one hour after the alarm on a bag leak detection system sounds, and complete in a timely manner, corrective actions as specified in your operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan required by § 63.1187 of this subpart.
                (2) When the alarm on a bag leak detection system sounds for more than five percent of the total operating time in a six-month reporting period, develop and implement a written quality improvement plan (QIP) consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring requirements of § 64.8(b)-(d) of 40 CFR part 64.
                (3) Additionally, on or after the applicable compliance date for each new or reconstructed cupola, you must either:
                (i) Maintain the operating temperature of the incinerator so that the average operating temperature for each three-hour block period never falls below the average temperature established during the performance test, or
                (ii) Maintain the percent excess oxygen in the cupola at or above the level established during the performance test. You must determine the percent excess oxygen using the following equation:
                
                  ER29JY15.000
                
                
                  
                  Where:
                  
                  Percent excess oxygen = Percentage of excess oxygen present above the stoichiometric balance of 1.00, (%).
                  1.00 = Ratio of oxygen in a cupola combustion chamber divided by the stoichiometric quantity of oxygen required to obtain complete combustion of fuel.
                  Oxygen available = Quantity of oxygen introduced into the cupola combustion zone.
                  Fuel demand for oxygen = Required quantity of oxygen for stoichiometric combustion of the quantity of fuel present.

                § 63.1179
                For curing ovens or combined collection/curing operations, what standards must I meet?
                (a) You must control emissions from each curing oven or combined collection/curing operations as specified in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (b) You must meet the following operating limits for each curing oven or combined collection/curing operation:
                (1) Maintain the free-formaldehyde content of each resin lot and the formaldehyde content of each binder formulation at or below the specification ranges of the resin and binder used during the performance test.
                (2) Maintain the operating temperature of each incinerator so that the average operating temperature for each three-hour block period never falls below the average temperature established during the performance test.

              Additional Monitoring Information
              
                § 63.1184
                What do I need to know about the design specifications, installation, and operation of a bag leak detection system?
                A bag leak detection system must meet the following requirements:
                (a) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
                (b) The sensor on the bag leak detection system must provide output of relative PM emissions.
                (c) The bag leak detection system must have an alarm that will sound automatically when it detects an increase in relative PM emissions greater than a preset level.
                (d) The alarm must be located in an area where appropriate plant personnel will be able to hear it.
                (e) For a positive-pressure fabric filter, each compartment or cell must have a bag leak detector. For a negative-pressure or induced-air fabric filter, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter. If multiple bag leak detectors are required (for either type of fabric filter), detectors may share the system instrumentation and alarm.
                (f) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained so that it follows EPA's “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). Other bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained so that they follow the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
                (g) At a minimum, initial adjustment of the system must consist of establishing the baseline output in both of the following ways:
                (1) Adjust the range and the averaging period of the device.
                (2) Establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
                (h) After initial adjustment, the range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted except as specified in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan required by § 63.1187 of this subpart. In no event may the range be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365 day period unless a responsible official as defined in § 63.2 of the general provisions in subpart A of this part certifies in writing to the Administrator that the fabric filter has been inspected and found to be in good operating condition.
              
              
                § 63.1185
                How do I establish the average operating temperature of an incinerator?
                (a) During the performance test, you must establish the average operating temperature of an incinerator as follows:
                (1) Continuously measure the operating temperature of the incinerator.
                (2) Determine and record the average temperatures in consecutive 15-minute blocks.
                (3) Determine and record the arithmetic average of the recorded average temperatures measured in consecutive 15-minute blocks for each of the one-hour performance test runs.
                (4) Determine and record the arithmetic average of the three one-hour average temperatures during the performance test runs. The average of the three one-hour performance test runs establishes the temperature level to use to monitor compliance.
                (b) To comply with the requirements for maintaining the operating temperature of an incinerator after the performance test, you must measure and record the average operating temperature of the incinerator as required by §§ 63.1182 and 63.1183 of this subpart. This average operating temperature of the incinerator is based on the arithmetic average of the one-hour average temperatures for each consecutive three-hour period and is determined in the same manner described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
              
              
                
                § 63.1186
                How may I change the compliance levels of monitored parameters?
                You may change control device and process operating parameter levels established during performance tests and used to monitor compliance if you do the following:
                (a) You must notify the Administrator of your desire to expand the range of a control device or process operating parameter level.
                (b) Upon approval from the Administrator, you must conduct additional performance tests at the proposed new control device or process operating parameter levels. Before operating at these levels, the performance test results must verify that, at the new levels, you comply with the emission limits in §§ 63.1178 and 63.1179 of this subpart.

                (a) An operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan must be submitted to the Administrator for review and approval as part of your application for the title V permit.
                (b) The operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan must include the following:
                (1) Process and control device parameters you will monitor to determine compliance, along with established operating levels or ranges for each process or control device.
                (2) A monitoring schedule.
                (3) Procedures for properly operating and maintaining control devices used to meet the standards in §§ 63.1178 and 63.1179 of this subpart. These procedures must include an inspection of each incinerator at least once per year. At a minimum, you must do the following as part of an incinerator inspection:
                (i) Inspect all burners, pilot assemblies, and pilot sensing devices for proper operation. Clean pilot sensor if necessary.
                (ii) Ensure proper adjustment of combustion air, and adjust if necessary.
                (iii) Inspect, when possible, all internal structures (such as baffles) to ensure structural integrity per the design specifications.
                (iv) Inspect dampers, fans, and blowers for proper operation.
                (v) Inspect motors for proper operation.
                (vi) Inspect, when possible, combustion chamber refractory lining. Clean, and repair or replace lining if necessary.
                (vii) Inspect incinerator shell for proper sealing, corrosion, and/or hot spots.
                (viii) For the burn cycle that follows the inspection, document that the incinerator is operating properly and make any necessary adjustments.

                (x) Complete all necessary repairs as soon as practicable.
                (4) Procedures for keeping records to document compliance.
                (5) Corrective actions you will take if process or control device parameters vary from the levels established during performance testing. For bag leak detection system alarms, example corrective actions that may be included in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan include:
                (i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.
                (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
                (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media, or otherwise repairing the control device.
                (iv) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment.
                (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.

              Appendix A to Subpart DDD of Part 63—Free Formaldehyde Analysis of Insulation Resins by the Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride Method
              1. Scope
              The method in this appendix was specifically developed for water-soluble phenolic resins that have a relatively high free-formaldehyde (FF) content such as insulation resins. It may also be suitable for other phenolic resins, especially those with a high FF content.
              2. Principle

              2.1 a. The basis for this method is the titration of the hydrochloric acid that is liberated when hydroxylamine hydrochloride reacts with formaldehyde to form formaldoxine:
              
              HCHO + NH2OH:HCl → CH2:NOH + H2O + HCl
              
              b. Free formaldehyde in phenolic resins is present as monomeric formaldehyde, hemiformals, polyoxymethylene hemiformals, and polyoxymethylene glycols. Monomeric formaldehyde and hemiformals react rapidly with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, but the polymeric forms of formaldehyde must hydrolyze to the monomeric state before they can react. The greater the concentration of free formaldehyde in a resin, the more of that formaldehyde will be in the polymeric form. The hydrolysis of these polymers is catalyzed by hydrogen ions.
              2.2 The resin sample being analyzed must contain enough free formaldehyde so that the initial reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride will produce sufficient hydrogen ions to catalyze the depolymerization of the polymeric formaldehyde within the time limits of the test method. The sample should contain approximately 0.3 grams (g) free formaldehyde to ensure complete reaction within 5 minutes.
              3. Apparatus
              3.1 Balance, readable to 0.01 g or better.
              3.2 pH meter, standardized to pH 4.0 with pH 4.0 buffer and pH 7 with pH 7.0 buffer.
              3.3 50-mL burette for 1.0 N sodium hydroxide.
              3.4 Magnetic stirrer and stir bars.
              3.5 250-mL beaker.
              3.6 50-mL graduated cylinder.
              3.7 100-mL graduated cylinder.
              3.8 Timer.
              4. Reagents
              4.1 Standardized 1.0 N sodium hydroxide solution.

              4.2 Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, 100 grams per liter, pH adjusted to 4.00.
              
              4.3 Hydrochloric acid solution, 1.0 N and 0.1 N.
              4.4 Sodium hydroxide solution, 0.1 N.
              4.5 50/50 v/v mixture of distilled water and methyl alcohol.
              5. Procedure
              5.1 Determine the sample size as follows:
              a. If the expected FF is greater than 2 percent, go to Part A in 5.1.c to determine sample size.
              b. If the expected FF is less than 2 percent, go to Part B in 5.1.d to determine sample size.
              c. Part A: Expected FF ≥2 percent.
              
              Grams resin = 60/expected percent FF
              
              I. The following table shows example levels:

              ii. It is very important to the accuracy of the results that the sample size be chosen correctly. If the milliliters of titrant are less than 15 mL or greater than 30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and repeat the tests.
              d. Part B: Expected FF <2 percent
              
              Grams resin = 30/expected percent FF

              ii. If the milliliters of titrant are less than 5 mL or greater than 30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and repeat the tests.
              5.2 Weigh the resin sample to the nearest 0.01 grams into a 250-mL beaker. Record sample weight.
              5.3 Add 100 mL of the methanol/water mixture and stir on a magnetic stirrer. Confirm that the resin has dissolved.
              5.4 Adjust the resin/solvent solution to pH 4.0, using the prestandardized pH meter, 1.0 N hydrochloric acid, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide.
              5.5 Add 50 mL of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, measured with a graduated cylinder. Start the timer.
              5.6 Stir for 5 minutes. Titrate to pH 4.0 with standardized 1.0 N sodium hydroxide. Record the milliliters of titrant and the normality.

              7. Method Precision and Accuracy

              Test values should conform to the following statistical precision:
              
              Variance = 0.005
              Standard deviation = 0.07
              95% Confidence Interval, for a single determination = 0.2
