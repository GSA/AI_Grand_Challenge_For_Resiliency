      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 266.100
              Applicability.
              (a) The regulations of this subpart apply to hazardous waste burned or processed in a boiler or industrial furnace (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) irrespective of the purpose of burning or processing, except as provided by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (g), and (h) of this section. In this subpart, the term “burn” means burning for energy recovery or destruction, or processing for materials recovery or as an ingredient. The emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 apply to facilities operating under interim status or under a RCRA permit as specified in §§ 266.102 and 266.103.
              (b) Integration of the MACT standards. (1) Except as provided by paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, the standards of this part do not apply to a new hazardous waste boiler or industrial furnace unit that becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005; or no longer apply when an owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste boiler or industrial furnace unit demonstrates compliance with the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with the requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter. Nevertheless, even after this demonstration of compliance with the MACT standards, RCRA permit conditions that were based on the standards of this part will continue to be in effect until they are removed from the permit or the permit is terminated or revoked, unless the permit expressly provides otherwise.
              (2) The following standards continue to apply:
              (i) If you elect to comply with § 270.235(a)(1)(i) of this chapter to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, § 266.102(e)(1) requiring operations in accordance with the operating requirements specified in the permit at all times that hazardous waste is in the unit, and § 266.102(e)(2)(iii) requiring compliance with the emission standards and operating requirements during startup and shutdown if hazardous waste is in the combustion chamber, except for particular hazardous wastes. These provisions apply only during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events;
              (ii) The closure requirements of §§ 266.102(e)(11) and 266.103(l);
              (iii) The standards for direct transfer of § 266.111;
              (iv) The standards for regulation of residues of § 266.112; and
              (v) The applicable requirements of subparts A through H, BB and CC of parts 264 and 265 of this chapter.

              (3) If you own or operate a boiler or hydrochloric acid production furnace that is an area source under § 63.2 of this chapter and you elect not to comply with the emission standards under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, and 63.1218 of this chapter for particulate matter, semivolatile and low volatile metals, and total chlorine, you also remain subject to:
              (i) Section 266.105—Standards to control particulate matter;
              (ii) Section 266.106—Standards to control metals emissions, except for mercury; and
              (iii) Section 266.107—Standards to control hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas.
              (4) The particulate matter standard of § 266.105 remains in effect for boilers that elect to comply with the alternative to the particulate matter standard under §§ 63.1216(e) and 63.1217(e) of this chapter.
              (c) The following hazardous wastes and facilities are not subject to regulation under this subpart:
              (1) Used oil burned for energy recovery that is also a hazardous waste solely because it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter. Such used oil is subject to regulation under part 279 of this chapter;
              (2) Gas recovered from hazardous or solid waste landfills when such gas is burned for energy recovery;
              (3) Hazardous wastes that are exempt from regulation under §§ 261.4 and 261.6(a)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this chapter, and hazardous wastes that are subject to the special requirements for conditionally exempt small quantity generators under § 261.5 of this chapter; and
              (4) Coke ovens, if the only hazardous waste burned is EPA Hazardous Waste No. K087, decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations.
              (d) Owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces (including pyrometallurgical devices such as cupolas, sintering machines, roasters, and foundry furnaces, but not including cement kilns, aggregate kilns, or halogen acid furnaces burning hazardous waste) that process hazardous waste solely for metal recovery are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for §§ 266.101 and 266.112.
              (1) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a metal recovery furnace or mercury recovery furnace must comply with the following requirements, except that an owner or operator of a lead or a nickel-chromium recovery furnace, or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that are subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP must comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
              (i) Provide a one-time written notice to the Director indicating the following:
              (A) The owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph;
              (B) The hazardous waste is burned solely for metal recovery consistent with the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
              (C) The hazardous waste contains recoverable levels of metals; and
              (D) The owner or operator will comply with the sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph;
              (ii) Sample and analyze the hazardous waste and other feedstocks as necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph by using appropriate methods; and
              (iii) Maintain at the facility for at least three years records to document compliance with the provisions of this paragraph including limits on levels of toxic organic constituents and Btu value of the waste, and levels of recoverable metals in the hazardous waste compared to normal nonhazardous waste feedstocks.
              (2) A hazardous waste meeting either of the following criteria is not processed solely for metal recovery:

              (i) The hazardous waste has a total concentration of organic compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned for destruction. The concentration of organic compounds in a waste as-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by bona fide treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500 ppm limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; or
              

              (ii) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by bona fide treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (3) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a lead or nickel-chromium or mercury recovery furnace (except for owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP) or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must provide a one-time written notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying whether the owner or operator claims an exemption for each waste under this paragraph or paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owners or operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for those wastes claimed to be exempt under that paragraph and must comply with the requirements below for those wastes claimed to be exempt under this paragraph (d)(3).
              (i) The hazardous wastes listed in appendices XI, XII, and XIII, part 266, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that:
              (A) A waste listed in appendix XI of this part must contain recoverable levels of lead, a waste listed in appendix XII of this part must contain recoverable levels of nickel or chromium, a waste listed in appendix XIII of this part must contain recoverable levels of mercury and contain less than 500 ppm of 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII organic constituents, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing must contain recoverable levels of metal; and
              (B) The waste does not exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic of § 261.24 of this chapter for an organic constituent; and
              (C) The waste is not a hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter because it is listed for an organic constituent as identified in appendix VII of part 261 of this chapter; and
              (D) The owner or operator certifies in the one-time notice that hazardous waste is burned under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and that sampling and analysis will be conducted or other information will be obtained as necessary to ensure continued compliance with these requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted according to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and records to document compliance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be kept for at least three years.
              (ii) The Director may decide on a case-by-case basis that the toxic organic constituents in a material listed in appendix XI, XII, or XIII of this part that contains a total concentration of more than 500 ppm toxic organic compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, may pose a hazard to human health and the environment when burned in a metal recovery furnace exempt from the requirements of this subpart. In that situation, after adequate notice and opportunity for comment, the metal recovery furnace will become subject to the requirements of this subpart when burning that material. In making the hazard determination, the Director will consider the following factors:
              (A) The concentration and toxicity of organic constituents in the material; and
              (B) The level of destruction of toxic organic constituents provided by the furnace; and
              (C) Whether the acceptable ambient levels established in appendices IV or V of this part may be exceeded for any toxic organic compound that may be emitted based on dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration.

              (e) The standards for direct transfer operations under § 266.111 apply only to facilities subject to the permit standards of § 266.102 or the interim status standards of § 266.103.
              
              (f) The management standards for residues under § 266.112 apply to any boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste.
              (g) Owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces (including pyrometallurgical devices such as cupolas, sintering machines, roasters, and foundry furnaces) that process hazardous waste for recovery of economically significant amounts of the precious metals gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, or ruthenium, or any combination of these are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for § 266.112. To be exempt from §§ 266.101 through 266.111, an owner or operator must:
              (1) Provide a one-time written notice to the Director indicating the following:
              (i) The owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph;
              (ii) The hazardous waste is burned for legitimate recovery of precious metal; and
              (iii) The owner or operator will comply with the sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph; and
              (2) Sample and analyze the hazardous waste as necessary to document that the waste contains economically significant amounts of the metals and that the treatment recovers economically significant amounts of precious metal; and
              (3) Maintain at the facility for at least three years records to document that all hazardous wastes burned are burned for recovery of economically significant amounts of precious metal.
              (h) Starting June 23, 1997, owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that process hazardous waste for recovery of lead and that are subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP, are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for § 266.101. To be exempt, an owner or operator must provide a one-time notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying that the owner or operator claims an exemption under this paragraph. The notice also must state that the waste burned has a total concentration of non-metal compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter of less than 500 ppm by weight, as fired and as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, or is listed in appendix XI to this part 266.

              § 266.102
              Permit standards for burners.
              (a) Applicability—(1) General. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste and not operating under interim status must comply with the requirements of this section and §§ 270.22 and 270.66 of this chapter, unless exempt under the small quantity burner exemption of § 266.108.
              (2) Applicability of part 264 standards. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste are subject to the following provisions of part 264 of this chapter, except as provided otherwise by this subpart:
              (i) In subpart A (General), 264.4;
              (ii) In subpart B (General facility standards), §§ 264.11-264.18;
              (iii) In subpart C (Preparedness and prevention), §§ 264.31-264.37;
              (iv) In subpart D (Contingency plan and emergency procedures), §§ 264.51-264.56;
              (v) In subpart E (Manifest system, recordkeeping, and reporting), the applicable provisions of §§ 264.71-264.77;
              (vi) In subpart F (Releases from Solid Waste Management Units), §§ 264.90 and 264.101;
              (vii) In subpart G (Closure and post-closure), §§ 264.111-264.115;
              (viii) In subpart H (Financial requirements), §§ 264.141, 264.142, 264.143, and 264.147-264.151, except that States and the Federal government are exempt from the requirements of subpart H; and
              (ix) Subpart BB (Air emission standards for equipment leaks), except §§ 264.1050(a).
              (b) Hazardous waste analysis. (1) The owner or operator must provide an analysis of the hazardous waste that quantifies the concentration of any constituent identified in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter that may reasonably be expected to be in the waste. Such constituents must be identified and quantified if present, at levels detectable by using appropriate analytical procedures. The appendix VIII, part 261 constituents excluded from this analysis must be identified and the basis for their exclusion explained. This analysis will be used to provide all information required by this subpart and §§ 270.22 and 270.66 of this chapter and to enable the permit writer to prescribe such permit conditions as necessary to protect human health and the environment. Such analysis must be included as a portion of the part B permit application, or, for facilities operating under the interim status standards of this subpart, as a portion of the trial burn plan that may be submitted before the part B application under provisions of § 270.66(g) of this chapter as well as any other analysis required by the permit authority in preparing the permit. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces not operating under the interim status standards must provide the information required by §§ 270.22 or 270.66(c) of this chapter in the part B application to the greatest extent possible.
              (2) Throughout normal operation, the owner or operator must conduct sampling and analysis as necessary to ensure that the hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks fired into the boiler or industrial furnace are within the physical and chemical composition limits specified in the permit.
              (c) Emissions standards. Owners and operators must comply with emissions standards provided by §§ 266.104 through 266.107.
              (d) Permits. (1) The owner or operator may burn only hazardous wastes specified in the facility permit and only under the operating conditions specified under paragraph (e) of this section, except in approved trial burns under the conditions specified in § 270.66 of this chapter.
              (2) Hazardous wastes not specified in the permit may not be burned until operating conditions have been specified under a new permit or permit modification, as applicable. Operating requirements for new wastes may be based on either trial burn results or alternative data included with part B of a permit application under § 270.22 of this chapter.

              (3) Boilers and industrial furnaces operating under the interim status standards of § 266.103 are permitted under procedures provided by § 270.66(g) of this chapter.
              
              (4) A permit for a new boiler or industrial furnace (those boilers and industrial furnaces not operating under the interim status standards) must establish appropriate conditions for each of the applicable requirements of this section, including but not limited to allowable hazardous waste firing rates and operating conditions necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, in order to comply with the following standards:
              (i) For the period beginning with initial introduction of hazardous waste and ending with initiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time required to bring the device to a point of operational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed a duration of 720 hours operating time when burning hazardous waste, the operating requirements must be those most likely to ensure compliance with the emission standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107, based on the Director's engineering judgment. If the applicant is seeking a waiver from a trial burn to demonstrate conformance with a particular emission standard, the operating requirements during this initial period of operation shall include those specified by the applicable provisions of § 266.104, § 266.105, § 266.106, or § 266.107. The Director may extend the duration of this period for up to 720 additional hours when good cause for the extension is demonstrated by the applicant.
              (ii) For the duration of the trial burn, the operating requirements must be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 and must be in accordance with the approved trial burn plan;
              (iii) For the period immediately following completion of the trial burn, and only for the minimum period sufficient to allow sample analysis, data computation, submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, review of the trial burn results and modification of the facility permit by the Director to reflect the trial burn results, the operating requirements must be those most likely to ensure compliance with the emission standards §§ 266.104 through 266.107 based on the Director's engineering judgment.
              (iv) For the remaining duration of the permit, the operating requirements must be those demonstrated in a trial burn or by alternative data specified in § 270.22 of this chapter, as sufficient to ensure compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107.
              (e) Operating requirements—(1) General. A boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste must be operated in accordance with the operating requirements specified in the permit at all times where there is hazardous waste in the unit.
              (2) Requirements to ensure compliance with the organic emissions standards—(i) DRE standard. Operating conditions will be specified either on a case-by-case basis for each hazardous waste burned as those demonstrated (in a trial burn or by alternative data as specified in § 270.22) to be sufficient to comply with the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) performance standard of § 266.104(a) or as those special operating requirements provided by § 266.104(a)(4) for the waiver of the DRE trial burn. When the DRE trial burn is not waived under § 266.104(a)(4), each set of operating requirements will specify the composition of the hazardous waste (including acceptable variations in the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous waste which will not affect compliance with the DRE performance standard) to which the operating requirements apply. For each such hazardous waste, the permit will specify acceptable operating limits including, but not limited to, the following conditions as appropriate:
              (A) Feed rate of hazardous waste and other fuels measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section;
              (B) Minimum and maximum device production rate when producing normal product expressed in appropriate units, measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section;
              (C) Appropriate controls of the hazardous waste firing system;

              (D) Allowable variation in boiler and industrial furnace system design or operating procedures;
              
              (E) Minimum combustion gas temperature measured at a location indicative of combustion chamber temperature, measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section;
              (F) An appropriate indicator of combustion gas velocity, measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, unless documentation is provided under § 270.66 of this chapter demonstrating adequate combustion gas residence time; and

              (6) Measuring parameters and establishing limits based on trial burn data—(i) General requirements. As specified in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(5) of this section, each operating parameter shall be measured, and permit limits on the parameter shall be established, according to either of the following procedures:
              (A) Instantaneous limits. A parameter may be measured and recorded on an instantaneous basis (i.e., the value that occurs at any time) and the permit limit specified as the time-weighted average during all valid runs of the trial burn; or
              (B) Hourly rolling average. (1) The limit for a parameter may be established and continuously monitored on an hourly rolling average basis defined as follows:
              (i) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.
              (ii) An hourly rolling average is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values recorded by the continuous monitoring system.
              (2) The permit limit for the parameter shall be established based on trial burn data as the average over all valid test runs of the highest hourly rolling average value for each run.
              (ii) Rolling average limits for carcinogenic metals and lead. Feed rate limits for the carcinogenic metals (i.e., arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and chromium) and lead may be established either on an hourly rolling average basis as prescribed by paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section or on (up to) a 24 hour rolling average basis. If the owner or operator elects to use an average period from 2 to 24 hours:
              (A) The feed rate of each metal shall be limited at any time to ten times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average basis;
              (B) The continuous monitor shall meet the following specifications:
              (1) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.
              (2) The rolling average for the selected averaging period is defined as the arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for the averaging period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the one minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one minute after the beginning of the preceding clock hour; and

              (C) The permit limit for the feed rate of each metal shall be established based on trial burn data as the average over all valid test runs of the highest hourly rolling average feed rate for each run.
              (iii) Feed rate limits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and ash. Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the substance (i.e., metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under the continuous monitoring requirements of paragraphs (e)(6) (i) and (ii) of this section.
              (iv) Conduct of trial burn testing. (A) If compliance with all applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 is not demonstrated simultaneously during a set of test runs, the operating conditions of additional test runs required to demonstrate compliance with remaining emissions standards must be as close as possible to the original operating conditions.
              (B) Prior to obtaining test data for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 or establishing limits on operating parameters under this section, the facility must operate under trial burn conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. The Director may determine, however, that industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with an alternative implementation approach for metals under § 266.106(f) need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of metals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals emissions.

              (C) Trial burn data on the level of an operating parameter for which a limit must be established in the permit must be obtained during emissions sampling for the pollutant(s) (i.e., metals, PM, HCl/Cl2, organic compounds) for which the parameter must be established as specified by paragraph (e) of this section.
              (7) General requirements—(i) Fugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions must be controlled by:
              (A) Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or
              (B) Maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure; or
              (C) An alternate means of control demonstrated (with part B of the permit application) to provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.
              (ii) Automatic waste feed cutoff. A boiler or industrial furnace must be operated with a functioning system that automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when operating conditions deviate from those established under this section. The Director may limit the number of cutoffs per an operating period on a case-by-case basis. In ­addition:
              (A) The permit limit for (the indicator of) minimum combustion chamber temperature must be maintained while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber,
              (B) Exhaust gases must be ducted to the air pollution control system operated in accordance with the permit requirements while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber; and
              (C) Operating parameters for which permit limits are established must continue to be monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be restarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the permit limits. For parameters that may be monitored on an instantaneous basis, the Director will establish a minimum period of time after a waste feed cutoff during which the parameter must not exceed the permit limit before the hazardous waste feed may be restarted.
              (iii) Changes. A boiler or industrial furnace must cease burning hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or feed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace feedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating conditions deviate from the limits as specified in the permit.
              (8) Monitoring and Inspections. (i) The owner or operator must monitor and record the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste:
              
              (A) If specified by the permit, feed rates and composition of hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks, and feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and chlorine;
              (B) If specified by the permit, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and oxygen on a continuous basis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace downstream of the combustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the atmosphere in accordance with operating requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in appendix IX of this part.
              (C) Upon the request of the Director, sampling and analysis of the hazardous waste (and other fuels and industrial furnace feedstocks as appropriate), residues, and exhaust emissions must be conducted to verify that the operating requirements established in the permit achieve the applicable standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107.
              (ii) All monitors shall record data in units corresponding to the permit limit unless otherwise specified in the ­permit.
              (iii) The boiler or industrial furnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage tanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when it contains hazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and signs of tampering.
              (iv) The automatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be tested at least once every 7 days when hazardous waste is burned to verify operability, unless the applicant demonstrates to the Director that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspections will be adequate. At a minimum, operational testing must be conducted at least once every 30 days.
              (v) These monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be placed in the operating record required by § 264.73 of this chapter.
              (9) Direct transfer to the burner. If hazardous waste is directly transferred from a transport vehicle to a boiler or industrial furnace without the use of a storage unit, the owner and operator must comply with § 266.111.
              (10) Recordkeeping. The owner or operator must maintain in the operating record of the facility all information and data required by this section for five years.
              (11) Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber sludges) from the boiler or industrial furnace.

              § 266.103
              Interim status standards for burners.
              (a) Purpose, scope, applicability—(1) General. (i) The purpose of this section is to establish minimum national standards for owners and operators of “existing” boilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste where such standards define the acceptable management of hazardous waste during the period of interim status. The standards of this section apply to owners and operators of existing facilities until either a permit is issued under § 266.102(d) or until closure responsibilities identified in this section are fulfilled.
              (ii) Existing or in existence means a boiler or industrial furnace that on or before August 21, 1991 is either in operation burning or processing hazardous waste or for which construction (including the ancillary facilities to burn or to process the hazardous waste) has commenced. A facility has commenced construction if the owner or operator has obtained the Federal, State, and local approvals or permits necessary to begin physical construction; and ­either:
              (A) A continuous on-site, physical construction program has begun; or
              (B) The owner or operator has entered into contractual obligations—which cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss—for physical construction of the facility to be completed within a reasonable time.

              (iii) If a boiler or industrial furnace is located at a facility that already has a permit or interim status, then the facility must comply with the applicable regulations dealing with permit modifications in § 270.42 or changes in interim status in § 270.72 of this chapter.
              (2) Exemptions. The requirements of this section do not apply to hazardous waste and facilities exempt under §§ 266.100(b), or 266.108.
              (3) Prohibition on burning dioxin-listed wastes. The following hazardous waste listed for dioxin and hazardous waste derived from any of these wastes may not be burned in a boiler or industrial furnace operating under interim status: F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027.
              (4) Applicability of part 265 standards. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste and are operating under interim status are subject to the following provisions of part 265 of this chapter, except as provided otherwise by this ­section:
              (i) In subpart A (General), § 265.4;
              (ii) In subpart B (General facility standards), §§ 265.11-265.17;
              (iii) In subpart C (Preparedness and prevention), §§ 265.31-265.37;
              (iv) In subpart D (Contingency plan and emergency procedures), §§ 265.51-265.56;
              (v) In subpart E (Manifest system, recordkeeping, and reporting), §§ 265.71-265.77, except that §§ 265.71, 265.72, and 265.76 do not apply to owners and operators of on-site facilities that do not receive any hazardous waste from off-site sources;
              (vi) In subpart G (Closure and post-closure), §§ 265.111-265.115;
              (vii) In subpart H (Financial requirements), §§ 265.141, 265.142, 265.143, and 265.147-265.150, except that States and the Federal government are exempt from the requirements of subpart H; and
              (viii) Subpart BB (Air emission standards for equipment leaks), except § 265.1050(a).
              (5) Special requirements for furnaces. The following controls apply during interim status to industrial furnaces (e.g., kilns, cupolas) that feed hazardous waste for a purpose other than solely as an ingredient (see paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section) at any location other than the hot end where products are normally discharged or where fuels are normally fired:
              (i) Controls. (A) The hazardous waste shall be fed at a location where combustion gas temperatures are at least 1800 °F;
              (B) The owner or operator must determine that adequate oxygen is present in combustion gases to combust organic constituents in the waste and retain documentation of such determination in the facility record;
              (C) For cement kiln systems, the hazardous waste shall be fed into the kiln; and
              (D) The hydrocarbon controls of § 266.104(c) or paragraph (c)(5) of this section apply upon certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section irrespective of the CO level achieved during the compliance test.
              (ii) Burning hazardous waste solely as an ingredient. A hazardous waste is burned for a purpose other than solely as an ingredient if it meets either of these criteria:

              (A) The hazardous waste has a total concentration of nonmetal compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned for destruction. The concentration of nonmetal compounds in a waste as-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by bona fide treatment that removes or destroys nonmetal constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500 ppm limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the facility record; or

              (B) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by bona fide treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly blended must be retained in the facility record.
              (6) Restrictions on burning hazardous waste that is not a fuel. Prior to certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, owners and operators shall not feed hazardous waste that has a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb, as-generated, (except that the heating value of a waste as-generated may be increased to above the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by bona fide treatment; however, blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and records must be kept to document that impermissible blending has not occurred) in a boiler or industrial furnace, except that:
              (i) Hazardous waste may be burned solely as an ingredient; or
              (ii) Hazardous waste may be burned for purposes of compliance testing (or testing prior to compliance testing) for a total period of time not to exceed 720 hours; or
              (iii) Such waste may be burned if the Director has documentation to show that, prior to August 21, 1991:
              (A) The boiler or industrial furnace is operating under the interim status standards for incinerators provided by subpart O of part 265 of this chapter, or the interim status standards for thermal treatment units provided by subpart P of part 265 of this chapter; and
              (B) The boiler or industrial furnace met the interim status eligibility requirements under § 270.70 of this chapter for subpart O or subpart P of part 265 of this chapter; and
              (C) Hazardous waste with a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb was burned prior to that date; or
              (iv) Such waste may be burned in a halogen acid furnace if the waste was burned as an excluded ingredient under § 261.2(e) of this chapter prior to February 21, 1991 and documentation is kept on file supporting this claim.
              (7) Direct transfer to the burner. If hazardous waste is directly transferred from a transport vehicle to a boiler or industrial furnace without the use of a storage unit, the owner and operator must comply with § 266.111.
              (b) Certification of precompliance—(1) General. The owner or operator must provide complete and accurate information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the Director on or before August 21, 1991, and must establish limits for the operating parameters specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such information is termed a “certification of precompliance” and constitutes a certification that the owner or operator has determined that, when the facility is operated within the limits specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the owner or operator believes that, using best engineering judgment, emissions of particulate matter, metals, and HCl and Cl2 are not likely to exceed the limits provided by §§ 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107. The facility may burn hazardous waste only under the operating conditions that the owner or operator establishes under paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the owner or operator submits a revised certification of precompliance under paragraph (b)(8) of this section or a certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, or until a permit is issued.

              (2) The rolling average for the selected averaging period is defined as the arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for the averaging period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the one minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one minute after the beginning of preceding clock hour.
              (iii) Feed rate limits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and ash. Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the substance (i.e., metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under the continuous monitoring requirements of paragraphs (b)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section.
              (6) Public notice requirements at precompliance.

              (B) Planned operating conditions, including levels for each pertinent parameter specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
              (3) Compliance testing—(i) General. Compliance testing must be conducted under conditions for which the owner or operator has submitted a certification of precompliance under paragraph (b) of this section and under conditions established in the notification of compliance testing required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The owner or operator may seek approval on a case-by-case basis to use compliance test data from one unit in lieu of testing a similar onsite unit. To support the request, the owner or operator must provide a comparison of the hazardous waste burned and other feedstreams, and the design, operation, and maintenance of both the tested unit and the similar unit. The Director shall provide a written approval to use compliance test data in lieu of testing a similar unit if he finds that the hazardous wastes, the devices, and the operating conditions are sufficiently similar, and the data from the other compliance test is adequate to meet the requirements of § 266.103(c).
              (ii) Special requirements for industrial furnaces that recycle collected PM. Owners and operators of industrial furnaces that recycle back into the furnace particulate matter (PM) from the air pollution control system must comply with one of the following procedures for testing to determine compliance with the metals standards of § 266.106(c) or (d):
              (A) The special testing requirements prescribed in “Alternative Method for Implementing Metals Controls” in appendix IX of this part; or
              (B) Stack emissions testing for a minimum of 6 hours each day while hazardous waste is burned during interim status. The testing must be conducted when burning normal hazardous waste for that day at normal feed rates for that day and when the air pollution control system is operated under normal conditions. During interim status, hazardous waste analysis for metals content must be sufficient for the owner or operator to determine if changes in metals content may affect the ability of the facility to meet the metals emissions standards established under § 266.106(c) or (d). Under this option, operating limits (under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must be established during compliance testing under paragraph (c)(3) of this section only on the following parameters;
              (1) Feed rate of total hazardous waste;
              (2) Total feed rate of chlorine and chloride in total feed streams;
              (3) Total feed rate of ash in total feed streams, except that the ash feed rate for cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns is not limited;
              (4) Carbon monoxide concentration, and where required, hydrocarbon concentration in stack gas;
              (5) Maximum production rate of the device in appropriate units when producing normal product; or
              (C) Conduct compliance testing to determine compliance with the metals standards to establish limits on the operating parameters of paragraph (c)(1) of this section only after the kiln system has been conditioned to enable it to reach equilibrium with respect to metals fed into the system and metals emissions. During conditioning, hazardous waste and raw materials having the same metals content as will be fed during the compliance test must be fed at the feed rates that will be fed during the compliance test.
              (iii) Conduct of compliance testing. (A) If compliance with all applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 is not demonstrated simultaneously during a set of test runs, the operating conditions of additional test runs required to demonstrate compliance with remaining emissions standards must be as close as possible to the original operating conditions.
              (B) Prior to obtaining test data for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 or establishing limits on operating parameters under this section, the facility must operate under compliance test conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. Industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, however, need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of metals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals.

              (C) Compliance test data on the level of an operating parameter for which a limit must be established in the certification of compliance must be obtained during emissions sampling for the pollutant(s) (i.e., metals, PM, HCl/Cl2, organic compounds) for which the parameter must be established as specified by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
              (4) Certification of compliance. Within 90 days of completing compliance testing, the owner or operator must certify to the Director compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 (b), (c), and (e), 266.105, 266.106, 266.107, and paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) of this section. The certification of compliance must include the following information:
              (i) General facility and testing information including:

              (G) Description of any changes in the unit configuration prior to or during testing that would alter any of the information submitted in the prior notice of compliance testing under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and an explanation of why the changes were necessary;
              (H) Description of any changes in the planned test conditions prior to or during the testing that alter any of the information submitted in the prior notice of compliance testing under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and an explanation of why the changes were necessary; and
              (I) The complete report on results of emissions testing.
              (ii) Specific information on each test including:

              (A) Purpose(s) of test (e.g., demonstrate conformance with the emissions limits for particulate matter, metals, HCl, Cl2, and CO)
              (B) Summary of test results for each run and for each test including the following information:
              (1) Date of run;
              (2) Duration of run;
              (3) Time-weighted average and highest hourly rolling average CO level for each run and for the test;
              (4) Highest hourly rolling average HC level, if HC monitoring is required for each run and for the test;
              (5) If dioxin and furan testing is required under § 266.104(e), time-weighted average emissions for each run and for the test of chlorinated dioxin and furan emissions, and the predicted maximum annual average ground level concentration of the toxicity equivalency factor;
              (6) Time-weighted average particulate matter emissions for each run and for the test;
              (7) Time-weighted average HCl and Cl2 emissions for each run and for the test;
              (8) Time-weighted average emissions for the metals subject to regulation under § 266.106 for each run and for the test; and
              (9) QA/QC results.
              (iii) Comparison of the actual emissions during each test with the emissions limits prescribed by §§ 266.104 (b), (c), and (e), 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 and established for the facility in the certification of precompliance under paragraph (b) of this section.
              (iv) Determination of operating limits based on all valid runs of the compliance test for each applicable parameter listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section using either of the following procedures:
              (A) Instantaneous limits. A parameter may be measured and recorded on an instantaneous basis (i.e., the value that occurs at any time) and the operating limit specified as the time-weighted average during all runs of the compliance test; or
              (B) Hourly rolling average basis. (1) The limit for a parameter may be established and continuously monitored on an hourly rolling average basis defined as follows:
              (i) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.
              (ii) An hourly rolling average is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values recorded by the continuous monitoring system.
              (2) The operating limit for the parameter shall be established based on compliance test data as the average over all test runs of the highest hourly rolling average value for each run.
              (C) Rolling average limits for carcinogenic metals and lead. Feed rate limits for the carcinogenic metals (i.e., arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and chromium) and lead may be established either on an hourly rolling average basis as prescribed by paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section or on (up to) a 24 hour rolling average basis. If the owner or operator elects to use an averaging period from 2 to 24 hours:
              (1) The feed rate of each metal shall be limited at any time to ten times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average basis;
              (2) The continuous monitor shall meet the following specifications:
              (i) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.
              (ii) The rolling average for the selected averaging period is defined as arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for the averaging period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the one minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one minute after the beginning of preceding clock hour; and
              (3) The operating limit for the feed rate of each metal shall be established based on compliance test data as the average over all test runs of the highest hourly rolling average feed rate for each run.
              (D) Feed rate limits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and ash. Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the substance (i.e., metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under the continuous monitoring requirements of paragraphs (c)(4)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section.
              (v) Certification of compliance statement. The following statement shall accompany the certification of ­compliance:
              
              
                “I certify under penalty of law that this information was prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information and supporting documentation. Copies of all emissions tests, dispersion modeling results and other information used to determine conformance with the requirements of § 266.103(c) are available at the facility and can be obtained from the facility contact person listed above. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manages the facility, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
                I also acknowledge that the operating conditions established in this certification pursuant to § 266.103(c)(4)(iv) are enforceable limits at which the facility can legally operate during interim status until a revised certification of compliance is submitted.”
              
              
              (5) Special requirements for HC monitoring systems. When an owner or operator is required to comply with the hydrocarbon (HC) controls provided by § 266.104(c) or paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) of this section, a conditioned gas monitoring system may be used in conformance with specifications provided in appendix IX of this part provided that the owner or operator submits a certification of compliance without using extensions of time provided by paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
              (6) Special operating requirements for industrial furnaces that recycle collected PM. Owners and operators of industrial furnaces that recycle back into the furnace particulate matter (PM) from the air pollution control system must:
              (i) When complying with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, comply with the operating requirements prescribed in “Alternative Method to Implement the Metals Controls” in appendix IX of this part; and
              (ii) When complying with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, comply with the operating requirements prescribed by that ­paragraph.
              (7) Extensions of time. (i) If the owner or operator does not submit a complete certification of compliance for all of the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 by August 21, 1992, he/she must either:
              
              (A) Stop burning hazardous waste and begin closure activities under paragraph (l) of this section for the hazardous waste portion of the facility; or
              (B) Limit hazardous waste burning only for purposes of compliance testing (and pretesting to prepare for compliance testing) a total period of 720 hours for the period of time beginning August 21, 1992, submit a notification to the Director by August 21, 1992 stating that the facility is operating under restricted interim status and intends to resume burning hazardous waste, and submit a complete certification of compliance by August 23, 1993; or
              (C) Obtain a case-by-case extension of time under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) The owner or operator may request a case-by-case extension of time to extend any time limit provided by paragraph (c) of this section if compliance with the time limit is not practicable for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operator.
              (A) In granting an extension, the Director may apply conditions as the facts warrant to ensure timely compliance with the requirements of this section and that the facility operates in a manner that does not pose a hazard to human health and the environment;
              (B) When an owner or operator requests an extension of time to enable the facility to comply with the alternative hydrocarbon provisions of § 266.104(f) and obtain a RCRA operating permit because the facility cannot meet the HC limit of § 266.104(c) of this chapter:
              (1) The Director shall, in considering whether to grant the extension:
              (i) Determine whether the owner and operator have submitted in a timely manner a complete part B permit application that includes information required under § 270.22(b) of this chapter; and
              (ii) Consider whether the owner and operator have made a good faith effort to certify compliance with all other emission controls, including the controls on dioxins and furans of § 266.104(e) and the controls on PM, metals, and HCl/Cl2.
              (2) If an extension is granted, the Director shall, as a condition of the extension, require the facility to operate under flue gas concentration limits on CO and HC that, based on available information, including information in the part B permit application, are baseline CO and HC levels as defined by § 266.104(f)(1).
              (8) Revised certification of compliance. The owner or operator may submit at any time a revised certification of compliance (recertification of compliance) under the following procedures:
              (i) Prior to submittal of a revised certification of compliance, hazardous waste may not be burned for more than a total of 720 hours under operating conditions that exceed those established under a current certification of compliance, and such burning may be conducted only for purposes of determining whether the facility can operate under revised conditions and continue to meet the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107;
              (ii) At least 30 days prior to first burning hazardous waste under operating conditions that exceed those established under a current certification of compliance, the owner or operator shall notify the Director and submit the following information:
              (A) EPA facility ID number, and facility name, contact person, telephone number, and address;
              (B) Operating conditions that the owner or operator is seeking to revise and description of the changes in facility design or operation that prompted the need to seek to revise the operating conditions;
              (C) A determination that when operating under the revised operating conditions, the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 are not likely to be exceeded. To document this determination, the owner or operator shall submit the applicable information required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

              (D) Complete emissions testing protocol for any pretesting and for a new compliance test to determine compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 when operating under revised operating conditions. The protocol shall include a schedule of pre-testing and compliance testing. If the owner and operator revises the scheduled date for the compliance test, he/she shall notify the Director in writing at least 30 days prior to the revised date of the compliance test;
              (iii) Conduct a compliance test under the revised operating conditions and the protocol submitted to the Director to determine compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107; and
              (iv) Submit a revised certification of compliance under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              (d) Periodic Recertifications. The owner or operator must conduct compliance testing and submit to the Director a recertification of compliance under provisions of paragraph (c) of this section within five years from submitting the previous certification or recertification. If the owner or operator seeks to recertify compliance under new operating conditions, he/she must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
              (e) Noncompliance with certification schedule. If the owner or operator does not comply with the interim status compliance schedule provided by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, hazardous waste burning must terminate on the date that the deadline is missed, closure activities must begin under paragraph (l) of this section, and hazardous waste burning may not resume except under an operating permit issued under § 270.66 of this chapter. For purposes of compliance with the closure provisions of paragraph (l) of this section and §§ 265.112(d)(2) and 265.113 of this chapter the boiler or industrial furnace has received “the known final volume of hazardous waste” on the date that the deadline is missed.
              (f) Start-up and shut-down. Hazardous waste (except waste fed solely as an ingredient under the Tier I (or adjusted Tier I) feed rate screening limits for metals and chloride/chlorine) must not be fed into the device during start-up and shut-down of the boiler or industrial furnace, unless the device is operating within the conditions of operation specified in the certification of compliance.
              (g) Automatic waste feed cutoff. During the compliance test required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and upon certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, a boiler or industrial furnace must be operated with a functioning system that automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when the applicable operating conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (v through xiii) of this section deviate from those established in the certification of compliance. In addition:
              (1) To minimize emissions of organic compounds, the minimum combustion chamber temperature (or the indicator of combustion chamber temperature) that occurred during the compliance test must be maintained while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber, with the minimum temperature during the compliance test defined as either:
              (i) If compliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an hourly rolling average, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is considered to be the average over all runs of the lowest hourly rolling average for each run; or
              (ii) If compliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an instantaneous temperature measurement, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is considered to be the time-weighted average temperature during all runs of the test; and
              (2) Operating parameters limited by the certification of compliance must continue to be monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be restarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the limits established in the certification of compliance.
              (h) Fugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions must be controlled by:
              (1) Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or
              (2) Maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure; or

              (3) An alternate means of control that the owner or operator can demonstrate provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. Support for such demonstration shall be included in the operating record.
              (i) Changes. A boiler or industrial furnace must cease burning hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or feed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace feedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating conditions deviate from the limits specified in the certification of compliance.
              (j) Monitoring and Inspections. (1) The owner or operator must monitor and record the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste:
              (i) Feed rates and composition of hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks, and feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and chlorine as necessary to ensure conformance with the certification of precompliance or certification of compliance;
              (ii) Carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen, and if applicable, hydrocarbons (HC), on a continuous basis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace downstream of the combustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the atmosphere in accordance with the operating limits specified in the certification of compliance. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in appendix IX of this part.
              (iii) Upon the request of the Director, sampling and analysis of the hazardous waste (and other fuels and industrial furnace feed stocks as appropriate) and the stack gas emissions must be conducted to verify that the operating conditions established in the certification of precompliance or certification of compliance achieve the applicable standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107.
              (2) The boiler or industrial furnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage tanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when they contain hazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and signs of tampering.
              (3) The automatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be tested at least once every 7 days when hazardous waste is burned to verify operability, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspections will be adequate. Support for such demonstration shall be included in the operating record. At a minimum, operational testing must be conducted at least once every 30 days.
              (4) These monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be placed in the operating log.
              (k) Recordkeeping. The owner or operator must keep in the operating record of the facility all information and data required by this section for five years.
              (l) Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber sludges) from the boiler or industrial furnace and must comply with §§ 265.111-265.115 of this chapter.
              [56 FR 7208, Feb. 21, 1991; 56 FR 32689, July 17, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 42512, 42514, Aug. 27, 1991; 57 FR 38564, Aug. 25, 1992; 57 FR 45000, Sept. 30, 1992; 60 FR 33913, June 29, 1995; 71 FR 16913, Apr. 4, 2006; 71 FR 40277, July 14, 2006]
            
            
              § 266.104
              Standards to control organic emissions.
              (a) DRE standard—(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for all organic hazardous constituents in the waste feed. To demonstrate conformance with this requirement, 99.99% DRE must be demonstrated during a trial burn for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated (under paragraph (a)(2) of this section) in its permit for each waste feed. DRE is determined for each POHC from the following equation:
              
                EC06NO91.000
              
              
                where:
                
                Win= Mass feed rate of one principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) in the hazardous waste fired to the boiler or industrial furnace; and
                
                Wout= Mass emission rate of the same POHC present in stack gas prior to release to the atmosphere.
              
              
              (2) Designation of POHCs. Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs) are those compounds for which compliance with the DRE requirements of this section shall be demonstrated in a trial burn in conformance with procedures prescribed in § 270.66 of this chapter. One or more POHCs shall be designated by the Director for each waste feed to be burned. POHCs shall be designated based on the degree of difficulty of destruction of the organic constituents in the waste and on their concentrations or mass in the waste feed considering the results of waste analyses submitted with part B of the permit application. POHCs are most likely to be selected from among those compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII of this chapter that are also present in the normal waste feed. However, if the applicant demonstrates to the Regional Administrator's satisfaction that a compound not listed in appendix VIII or not present in the normal waste feed is a suitable indicator of compliance with the DRE requirements of this section, that compound may be designated as a POHC. Such POHCs need not be toxic or organic compounds.
              (3) Dioxin-listed waste. A boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste containing (or derived from) EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% for each POHC designated (under paragraph (a)(2) of this section) in its permit. This performance must be demonstrated on POHCs that are more difficult to burn than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. DRE is determined for each POHC from the equation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator of the boiler or industrial furnace must notify the Director of intent to burn EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.
              (4) Automatic waiver of DRE trial burn. Owners and operators of boilers operated under the special operating requirements provided by § 266.110 are considered to be in compliance with the DRE standard of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and are exempt from the DRE trial burn.
              (5) Low risk waste. Owners and operators of boilers or industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste in compliance with the requirements of § 266.109(a) are considered to be in compliance with the DRE standard of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and are exempt from the DRE trial burn.
              (b) Carbon monoxide standard. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the stack gas concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) from a boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste cannot exceed 100 ppmv on an hourly rolling average basis (i.e., over any 60 minute period), continuously corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry gas basis.
              (2) CO and oxygen shall be continuously monitored in conformance with “Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste” in appendix IX of this part.
              (3) Compliance with the 100 ppmv CO limit must be demonstrated during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities). To demonstrate compliance, the highest hourly rolling average CO level during any valid run of the trial burn or compliance test must not exceed 100 ppmv.
              (c) Alternative carbon monoxide standard. (1) The stack gas concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) from a boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste may exceed the 100 ppmv limit provided that stack gas concentrations of hydrocarbons (HC) do not exceed 20 ppmv, except as provided by paragraph (f) of this section for certain industrial furnaces.

              (2) HC limits must be established under this section on an hourly rolling average basis (i.e., over any 60 minute period), reported as propane, and continuously corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry gas basis.

              (3) HC shall be continuously monitored in conformance with “Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring of Hydrocarbons for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste” in appendix IX of this part. CO and oxygen shall be continuously monitored in conformance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (4) The alternative CO standard is established based on CO data during the trial burn (for a new facility) and the compliance test (for an interim status facility). The alternative CO standard is the average over all valid runs of the highest hourly average CO level for each run. The CO limit is implemented on an hourly rolling average basis, and continuously corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry gas basis.
              (d) Special requirements for furnaces. Owners and operators of industrial furnaces (e.g., kilns, cupolas) that feed hazardous waste for a purpose other than solely as an ingredient (see § 266.103(a)(5)(ii)) at any location other than the end where products are normally discharged and where fuels are normally fired must comply with the hydrocarbon limits provided by paragraphs (c) or (f) of this section irrespective of whether stack gas CO concentrations meet the 100 ppmv limit of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (e) Controls for dioxins and furans. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces that are equipped with a dry particulate matter control device that operates within the temperature range of 450-750 °F, and industrial furnaces operating under an alternative hydrocarbon limit established under paragraph (f) of this section must conduct a site-specific risk assessment as follows to demonstrate that emissions of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans do not result in an increased lifetime cancer risk to the hypothetical maximum exposed individual (MEI) exceeding 1 in 100,000:
              (1) During the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or compliance test (for interim status facilities), determine emission rates of the tetra-octa congeners of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (CDDs/CDFs) using Method 0023A, Sampling Method for Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans Emissions from Stationary Sources, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter.
              (2) Estimate the 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalence of the tetra-octa CDDs/CDFs congeners using “Procedures for Estimating the Toxicity Equivalence of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxin and Dibenzofuran Congeners” in appendix IX of this part. Multiply the emission rates of CDD/CDF congeners with a toxicity equivalence greater than zero (see the procedure) by the calculated toxicity equivalence factor to estimate the equivalent emission rate of 2,3,7,8-TCDD;
              (3) Conduct dispersion modeling using methods recommended in appendix W of part 51 of this chapter (“Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)” (1986) and its supplements), the “Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality Screening Procedure”, provided in appendix IX of this part, or in Screening Procedures for Estimating the Air Quality Impact of Stationary Sources, Revised (incorporated by reference in § 260.11) to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The maximum annual average concentration must be used when a person resides on-site; and

              (4) The ratio of the predicted maximum annual average ground level concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents to the risk-specific dose for 2,3,7,8-TCDD provided in appendix V of this part (2.2 × 10−7) shall not exceed 1.0.
              (f) Monitoring CO and HC in the by-pass duct of a cement kiln. Cement kilns may comply with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon limits provided by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section by monitoring in the by-pass duct provided that:
              (1) Hazardous waste is fired only into the kiln and not at any location downstream from the kiln exit relative to the direction of gas flow; and
              (2) The by-pass duct diverts a minimum of 10% of kiln off-gas into the duct.
              (g) Use of emissions test data to demonstrate compliance and establish operating limits. Compliance with the requirements of this section must be demonstrated simultaneously by emissions testing or during separate runs under identical operating conditions. Further, data to demonstrate compliance with the CO and HC limits of this section or to establish alternative CO or HC limits under this section must be obtained during the time that DRE testing, and where applicable, CDD/CDF testing under paragraph (e) of this section and comprehensive organic emissions testing under paragraph (f) is conducted.
              (h) Enforcement. For the purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under § 266.102) will be regarded as compliance with this section. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section may be “information” justifying modification or revocation and re-issuance of a permit under § 270.41 of this chapter.

              § 266.105
              Standards to control particulate matter.
              (a) A boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste may not emit particulate matter in excess of 180 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot) after correction to a stack gas concentration of 7% oxygen, using procedures prescribed in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, methods 1 through 5, and appendix IX of this part.
              (b) An owner or operator meeting the requirements of § 266.109(b) for the low risk waste exemption is exempt from the particulate matter standard.
              (c) Oxygen correction. (1) Measured pollutant levels must be corrected for the amount of oxygen in the stack gas according to the formula:
              
                ER30SE99.027
              
              
                Where:
                
                Pc is the corrected concentration of the pollutant in the stack gas, Pm is the measured concentration of the pollutant in the stack gas, E is the oxygen concentration on a dry basis in the combustion air fed to the device, and Y is the measured oxygen concentration on a dry basis in the stack.
              
              
              (2) For devices that feed normal combustion air, E will equal 21 percent. For devices that feed oxygen-enriched air for combustion (that is, air with an oxygen concentration exceeding 21 percent), the value of E will be the concentration of oxygen in the enriched air.
              (3) Compliance with all emission standards provided by this subpart must be based on correcting to 7 percent oxygen using this procedure.
              (d) For the purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under § 266.102) will be regarded as compliance with this section. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section may be “information” justifying modification or revocation and re-issuance of a permit under § 270.41 of this chapter.

              § 266.106
              Standards to control metals emissions.
              (a) General. The owner or operator must comply with the metals standards provided by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section for each metal listed in paragraph (b) of this section that is present in the hazardous waste at detectable levels by using appropriate analytical procedures.
              (b) Tier I feed rate screening limits. Feed rate screening limits for metals are specified in appendix I of this part as a function of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use in the vicinity of the facility. Criteria for facilities that are not eligible to comply with the screening limits are provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this ­section.
              (1) Noncarcinogenic metals. The feed rates of antimony, barium, lead, mercury, thallium, and silver in all feed streams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks shall not exceed the screening limits specified in appendix I of this part.
              
              (i) The feed rate screening limits for antimony, barium, mercury, thallium, and silver are based on either:
              (A) An hourly rolling average as defined in § 266.102(e)(6)(i)(B); or
              (B) An instantaneous limit not to be exceeded at any time.
              (ii) The feed rate screening limit for lead is based on one of the following:
              (A) An hourly rolling average as defined in § 266.102(e)(6)(i)(B);
              (B) An averaging period of 2 to 24 hours as defined in § 266.102(e)(6)(ii) with an instantaneous feed rate limit not to exceed 10 times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average basis; or
              (C) An instantaneous limit not to be exceeded at any time.
              (2) Carcinogenic metals. (i) The feed rates of arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and chromium in all feed streams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks shall not exceed values derived from the screening limits specified in appendix I of this part. The feed rate of each of these metals is limited to a level such that the sum of the ratios of the actual feed rate to the feed rate screening limit specified in appendix I shall not exceed 1.0, as provided by the following ­equation:
              
                EC06NO91.001
              
              
                where:
                
                n = number of carcinogenic metals
                AFR = actual feed rate to the device for metal “i”
                FRSL = feed rate screening limit provided by appendix I of this part for metal “i”.
              
              
              (ii) The feed rate screening limits for the carcinogenic metals are based on either:
              (A) An hourly rolling average; or
              (B) An averaging period of 2 to 24 hours as defined in § 266.102(e)(6)(ii) with an instantaneous feed rate limit not to exceed 10 times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average basis.
              (3) TESH. (i) The terrain-adjusted effective stack height is determined according to the following equation:
              
              TESH = Ha + H1−Tr
              
              
                where:
                
                Ha = Actual physical stack height
                H1 = Plume rise as determined from appendix VI of this part as a function of stack flow rate and stack gas exhaust temperature.
                Tr = Terrain rise within five kilometers of the stack.
              
              
              (ii) The stack height (Ha) may not exceed good engineering practice as specified in 40 CFR 51.100(ii).
              (iii) If the TESH for a particular facility is not listed in the table in the appendices, the nearest lower TESH listed in the table shall be used. If the TESH is four meters or less, a value of four meters shall be used.
              (4) Terrain type. The screening limits are a function of whether the facility is located in noncomplex or complex terrain. A device located where any part of the surrounding terrain within 5 kilometers of the stack equals or exceeds the elevation of the physical stack height (Ha) is considered to be in complex terrain and the screening limits for complex terrain apply. Terrain measurements are to be made from U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic maps of the area surrounding the facility.
              (5) Land use. The screening limits are a function of whether the facility is located in an area where the land use is urban or rural. To determine whether land use in the vicinity of the facility is urban or rural, procedures provided in appendices IX or X of this part shall be used.
              (6) Multiple stacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit subject to controls of metals emissions under a RCRA operating permit or interim status controls must comply with the screening limits for all such units assuming all hazardous waste is fed into the device with the worst-case stack based on dispersion characteristics. The worst-case stack is determined from the following equation as applied to each stack:
              
              K = HVT
              
              
                Where:
                
                K = a parameter accounting for relative influence of stack height and plume rise;
                H = physical stack height (meters);
                V = stack gas flow rate (m3/second); and
                T = exhaust temperature (°K).
                
                The stack with the lowest value of K is the worst-case stack.
              
              
              (7) Criteria for facilities not eligible for screening limits. If any criteria below are met, the Tier I and Tier II screening limits do not apply. Owners and operators of such facilities must comply with either the Tier III standards provided by paragraph (d) of this section or with the adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits provided by paragraph (e) of this section.
              (i) The device is located in a narrow valley less than one kilometer wide;
              (ii) The device has a stack taller than 20 meters and is located such that the terrain rises to the physical height within one kilometer of the facility;
              (iii) The device has a stack taller than 20 meters and is located within five kilometers of a shoreline of a large body of water such as an ocean or large lake;
              (iv) The physical stack height of any stack is less than 2.5 times the height of any building within five building heights or five projected building widths of the stack and the distance from the stack to the closest boundary is within five building heights or five projected building widths of the associated building; or
              (v) The Director determines that standards based on site-specific dispersion modeling are required.
              (8) Implementation. The feed rate of metals in each feedstream must be monitored to ensure that the feed rate screening limits are not exceeded.
              (c) Tier II emission rate screening limits. Emission rate screening limits are specified in appendix I as a function of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use in the vicinity of the facility. Criteria for facilities that are not eligible to comply with the screening limits are provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
              (1) Noncarcinogenic metals. The emission rates of antimony, barium, lead, mercury, thallium, and silver shall not exceed the screening limits specified in appendix I of this part.
              (2) Carcinogenic metals. The emission rates of arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and chromium shall not exceed values derived from the screening limits specified in appendix I of this part. The emission rate of each of these metals is limited to a level such that the sum of the ratios of the actual emission rate to the emission rate screening limit specified in appendix I shall not exceed 1.0, as provided by the following ­equation:
              
                EC06NO91.002
              
              
                where:
                
                n = number of carcinogenic metals
                AER = actual emission rate for metal “i”
                ERSL = emission rate screening limit provided by appendix I of this part for metal “i”.
              
              
              (3) Implementation. The emission rate limits must be implemented by limiting feed rates of the individual metals to levels during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities). The feed rate averaging periods are the same as provided by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The feed rate of metals in each feedstream must be monitored to ensure that the feed rate limits for the feedstreams specified under §§ 266.102 or 266.103 are not exceeded.
              (4) Definitions and limitations. The definitions and limitations provided by paragraph (b) of this section for the following terms also apply to the Tier II emission rate screening limits provided by paragraph (c) of this section: terrain-adjusted effective stack height, good engineering practice stack height, terrain type, land use, and criteria for facilities not eligible to use the screening limits.
              (5) Multiple stacks. (i) Owners and operators of facilities with more than one onsite stack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit subject to controls on metals emissions under a RCRA operating permit or interim status controls must comply with the emissions screening limits for any such stacks assuming all hazardous waste is fed into the device with the worst-case stack based on dispersion characteristics.
              (ii) The worst-case stack is determined by procedures provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

              (iii) For each metal, the total emissions of the metal from those stacks shall not exceed the screening limit for the worst-case stack.
              (d) Tier III and Adjusted Tier I site-specific risk assessment. The requirements of this paragraph apply to facilities complying with either the Tier III or Adjusted Tier I controls, except where specified otherwise.
              (1) General. Conformance with the Tier III metals controls must be demonstrated by emissions testing to determine the emission rate for each metal. In addition, conformance with either the Tier III or Adjusted Tier I metals controls must be demonstrated by air dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration for each metal, and a demonstration that acceptable ambient levels are not ­exceeded.
              (2) Acceptable ambient levels. Appendices IV and V of this part list the acceptable ambient levels for purposes of this rule. Reference air concentrations (RACs) are listed for the noncarcinogenic metals and 10−5 risk-specific doses (RSDs) are listed for the carcinogenic metals. The RSD for a metal is the acceptable ambient level for that metal provided that only one of the four carcinogenic metals is emitted. If more than one carcinogenic metal is emitted, the acceptable ambient level for the carcinogenic metals is a fraction of the RSD as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (3) Carcinogenic metals. For the carcinogenic metals, arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and chromium, the sum of the ratios of the predicted maximum annual average off-site ground level concentrations (except that on-site concentrations must be considered if a person resides on site) to the risk-specific dose (RSD) for all carcinogenic metals emitted shall not exceed 1.0 as determined by the following equation:
              
                EC06NO91.003
              
              
                where: n = number of carcinogenic metals
              
              
              (4) Noncarcinogenic metals. For the noncarcinogenic metals, the predicted maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration for each metal shall not exceed the reference air concentration (RAC).
              (5) Multiple stacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit subject to controls on metals emissions under a RCRA operating permit or interim status controls must conduct emissions testing (except that facilities complying with Adjusted Tier I controls need not conduct emissions testing) and dispersion modeling to demonstrate that the aggregate emissions from all such on-site stacks do not result in an exceedance of the acceptable ambient levels.
              (6) Implementation. Under Tier III, the metals controls must be implemented by limiting feed rates of the individual metals to levels during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities). The feed rate averaging periods are the same as provided by paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The feed rate of metals in each feedstream must be monitored to ensure that the feed rate limits for the feedstreams specified under §§ 266.102 or 266.103 are not exceeded.
              (e) Adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits. The owner or operator may adjust the feed rate screening limits provided by appendix I of this part to account for site-specific dispersion modeling. Under this approach, the adjusted feed rate screening limit for a metal is determined by back-calculating from the acceptable ambient level provided by appendices IV and V of this part using dispersion modeling to determine the maximum allowable emission rate. This emission rate becomes the adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limit. The feed rate screening limits for carcinogenic metals are implemented as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (f) Alternative implementation approaches. (1) The Director may approve on a case-by-case basis approaches to implement the Tier II or Tier III metals emission limits provided by paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section alternative to monitoring the feed rate of metals in each feedstream.
              (2) The emission limits provided by paragraph (d) of this section must be determined as follows:
              (i) For each noncarcinogenic metal, by back-calculating from the RAC provided in appendix IV of this part to determine the allowable emission rate for each metal using the dilution factor for the maximum annual average ground level concentration predicted by dispersion modeling in conformance with paragraph (h) of this section; and
              (ii) For each carcinogenic metal by:
              (A) Back-calculating from the RSD provided in appendix V of this part to determine the allowable emission rate for each metal if that metal were the only carcinogenic metal emitted using the dilution factor for the maximum annual average ground level concentration predicted by dispersion modeling in conformance with paragraph (h) of this section; and
              (B) If more than one carcinogenic metal is emitted, selecting an emission limit for each carcinogenic metal not to exceed the emission rate determined by paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section such that the sum for all carcinogenic metals of the ratios of the selected emission limit to the emission rate determined by that paragraph does not exceed 1.0.
              (g) Emission testing—(1) General. Emission testing for metals shall be conducted using Method 0060, Determinations of Metals in Stack Emissions, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter.
              (2) Hexavalent chromium. Emissions of chromium are assumed to be hexavalent chromium unless the owner or operator conducts emissions testing to determine hexavalent chromium emissions using procedures prescribed in Method 0061, Determination of Hexavalent Chromium Emissions from Stationary Sources, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter.
              (h) Dispersion Modeling. Dispersion modeling required under this section shall be conducted according to methods recommended in appendix W of part 51 of this chapter (“Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)” (1986) and its supplements), the “Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality Screening Procedure”, provided in appendix IX of this part, or in Screening Procedures for Estimating the Air Quality Impact of Stationary Sources, Revised (incorporated by reference in § 260.11) to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration. However, on-site concentrations must be considered when a person resides on-site.
              (i) Enforcement. For the purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under § 266.102) will be regarded as compliance with this section. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section may be “information” justifying modification or revocation and re-issuance of a permit under § 270.41 of this chapter.

              § 266.107
              Standards to control hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine gas (Cl 2) emissions.
              (a) General. The owner or operator must comply with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine (Cl2) controls provided by paragraph (b), (c), or (e) of this section.
              (b) Screening limits—(1) Tier I feed rate screening limits. Feed rate screening limits are specified for total chlorine in appendix II of this part as a function of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use in the vicinity of the facility. The feed rate of total chlorine and chloride, both organic and inorganic, in all feed streams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks shall not exceed the levels ­specified.
              
              (2) Tier II emission rate screening limits. Emission rate screening limits for HCl and Cl2 are specified in appendix III of this part as a function of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use in the vicinity of the facility. The stack emission rates of HCl and Cl2 shall not exceed the levels specified.
              (3) Definitions and limitations. The definitions and limitations provided by § 266.106(b) for the following terms also apply to the screening limits provided by this paragraph: terrain-adjusted effective stack height, good engineering practice stack height, terrain type, land use, and criteria for facilities not eligible to use the screening limits.
              (4) Multiple stacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit subject to controls on HCl or Cl2 emissions under a RCRA operating permit or interim status controls must comply with the Tier I and Tier II screening limits for those stacks assuming all hazardous waste is fed into the device with the worst-case stack based on dispersion characteristics.
              (i) The worst-case stack is determined by procedures provided in § 266.106(b)(6).
              (ii) Under Tier I, the total feed rate of chlorine and chloride to all subject devices shall not exceed the screening limit for the worst-case stack.

              (iii) Under Tier II, the total emissions of HCl and Cl2 from all subject stacks shall not exceed the screening limit for the worst-case stack.
              (c) Tier III site-specific risk assessments—(1) General. Conformance with the Tier III controls must be demonstrated by emissions testing to determine the emission rate for HCl and Cl2, air dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration for each compound, and a demonstration that acceptable ambient levels are not exceeded.
              (2) Acceptable ambient levels. Appendix IV of this part lists the reference air concentrations (RACs) for HCl (7 micrograms per cubic meter) and Cl2 (0.4 micrograms per cubic meter).
              (3) Multiple stacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit subject to controls on HCl or Cl2 emissions under a RCRA operating permit or interim status controls must conduct emissions testing and dispersion modeling to demonstrate that the aggregate emissions from all such on-site stacks do not result in an exceedance of the acceptable ambient levels for HCl and Cl2.
              (d) Averaging periods. The HCl and Cl2 controls are implemented by limiting the feed rate of total chlorine and chloride in all feedstreams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks. Under Tier I, the feed rate of total chloride and chlorine is limited to the Tier I Screening Limits. Under Tier II and Tier III, the feed rate of total chloride and chlorine is limited to the feed rates during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities). The feed rate limits are based on either:
              (1) An hourly rolling average as defined in § 266.102(e)(6); or
              (2) An instantaneous basis not to be exceeded at any time.
              (e) Adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits. The owner or operator may adjust the feed rate screening limit provided by appendix II of this part to account for site-specific dispersion modeling. Under this approach, the adjusted feed rate screening limit is determined by back-calculating from the acceptable ambient level for Cl2 provided by appendix IV of this part using dispersion modeling to determine the maximum allowable emission rate. This emission rate becomes the adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limit.
              (f) Emissions testing. Emissions testing for HCl and Cl2 shall be conducted using the procedures described in Methods 0050 or 0051, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter.
              (g) Dispersion modeling. Dispersion modeling shall be conducted according to the provisions of § 266.106(h).
              (h) Enforcement. For the purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under § 266.102) will be regarded as compliance with this section. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section may be “information” justifying modification or revocation and re-issuance of a permit under § 270.41 of this chapter.

                n means the number of stacks;
                Actual Quantity Burned means the waste quantity burned per month in device “i”;
                Allowable Quantity Burned means the maximum allowable exempt quantity for stack “i” from the table in (a)(1) above.
              
              
              
                Note:
                Hazardous wastes that are subject to the special requirements for small quantity generators under § 261.5 of this chapter may be burned in an off-site device under the exemption provided by § 266.108, but must be included in the quantity determination for the exemption.
              
              
              (d) Notification requirements. The owner or operator of facilities qualifying for the small quantity burner exemption under this section must provide a one-time signed, written notice to EPA indicating the following:
              (1) The combustion unit is operating as a small quantity burner of hazardous waste;
              (2) The owner and operator are in compliance with the requirements of this section; and
              (3) The maximum quantity of hazardous waste that the facility may burn per month as provided by § 266.108(a)(1).
              (e) Recordkeeping requirements. The owner or operator must maintain at the facility for at least three years sufficient records documenting compliance with the hazardous waste quantity, firing rate, and heating value limits of this section. At a minimum, these records must indicate the quantity of hazardous waste and other fuel burned in each unit per calendar month, and the heating value of the hazardous waste.

              Low risk waste exemption.
              (a) Waiver of DRE standard. The DRE standard of § 266.104(a) does not apply if the boiler or industrial furnace is operated in conformance with (a)(1) of this section and the owner or operator demonstrates by procedures prescribed in (a)(2) of this section that the burning will not result in unacceptable adverse health effects.
              (1) The device shall be operated as follows:
              (i) A minimum of 50 percent of fuel fired to the device shall be fossil fuel, fuels derived from fossil fuel, tall oil, or, if approved by the Director on a case-by-case basis, other nonhazardous fuel with combustion characteristics comparable to fossil fuel. Such fuels are termed “primary fuel” for purposes of this section. (Tall oil is a fuel derived from vegetable and rosin fatty acids.) The 50 percent primary fuel firing rate shall be determined on a total heat or mass input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of primary fuel fired;
              (ii) Primary fuels and hazardous waste fuels shall have a minimum as-fired heating value of 8,000 Btu/lb;
              (iii) The hazardous waste is fired directly into the primary fuel flame zone of the combustion chamber; and
              (iv) The device operates in conformance with the carbon monoxide controls provided by § 266.104(b)(1). Devices subject to the exemption provided by this section are not eligible for the alternative carbon monoxide controls provided by § 266.104(c).
              (2) Procedures to demonstrate that the hazardous waste burning will not pose unacceptable adverse public health effects are as follows:
              (i) Identify and quantify those nonmetal compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter that could reasonably be expected to be present in the hazardous waste. The constituents excluded from analysis must be identified and the basis for their exclusion explained;
              (ii) Calculate reasonable, worst case emission rates for each constituent identified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by assuming the device achieves 99.9 percent destruction and removal efficiency. That is, assume that 0.1 percent of the mass weight of each constituent fed to the device is emitted.
              (iii) For each constituent identified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, use emissions dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average ground level concentration of the constituent.
              (A) Dispersion modeling shall be conducted using methods specified in § 266.106(h).
              (B) Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler or industrial furnace that is exempt under this section must conduct dispersion modeling of emissions from all stacks exempt under this section to predict ambient levels prescribed by this paragraph.
              (iv) Ground level concentrations of constituents predicted under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section must not exceed the following levels:
              (A) For the noncarcinogenic compounds listed in appendix IV of this part, the levels established in appendix IV;
              (B) For the carcinogenic compounds listed in appendix V of this part, the sum for all constituents of the ratios of the actual ground level concentration to the level established in appendix V cannot exceed 1.0; and
              (C) For constituents not listed in appendix IV or V, 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter.
              (b) Waiver of particulate matter standard. The particulate matter standard of § 266.105 does not apply if:

              (1) The DRE standard is waived under paragraph (a) of this section; and
              
              (2) The owner or operator complies with the Tier I or adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits provided by § 266.106 (b) or (e).

              § 266.110
              Waiver of DRE trial burn for boilers.
              Boilers that operate under the special requirements of this section, and that do not burn hazardous waste containing (or derived from) EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027, are considered to be in conformance with the DRE standard of § 266.104(a), and a trial burn to demonstrate DRE is waived. When burning hazardous waste:
              (a) A minimum of 50 percent of fuel fired to the device shall be fossil fuel, fuels derived from fossil fuel, tall oil, or, if approved by the Director on a case-by-case basis, other nonhazardous fuel with combustion characteristics comparable to fossil fuel. Such fuels are termed “primary fuel” for purposes of this section. (Tall oil is a fuel derived from vegetable and rosin fatty acids.) The 50 percent primary fuel firing rate shall be determined on a total heat or mass input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of primary fuel fired;
              (b) Boiler load shall not be less than 40 percent. Boiler load is the ratio at any time of the total heat input to the maximum design heat input;
              (c) Primary fuels and hazardous waste fuels shall have a minimum as-fired heating value of 8,000 Btu/lb, and each material fired in a burner where hazardous waste is fired must have a heating value of at least 8,000 Btu/lb, as-fired;
              (d) The device shall operate in conformance with the carbon monoxide standard provided by § 266.104(b)(1). Boilers subject to the waiver of the DRE trial burn provided by this section are not eligible for the alternative carbon monoxide standard provided by § 266.104(c);
              (e) The boiler must be a watertube type boiler that does not feed fuel using a stoker or stoker type mechanism; and
              (f) The hazardous waste shall be fired directly into the primary fuel flame zone of the combustion chamber with an air or steam atomization firing system, mechanical atomization system, or a rotary cup atomization system under the following conditions:
              (1) Viscosity. The viscosity of the hazardous waste fuel as-fired shall not exceed 300 SSU;
              (2) Particle size. When a high pressure air or steam atomizer, low pressure atomizer, or mechanical atomizer is used, 70% of the hazardous waste fuel must pass through a 200 mesh (74 micron) screen, and when a rotary cup atomizer is used, 70% of the hazardous waste must pass through a 100 mesh (150 micron) screen;
              (3) Mechanical atomization systems. Fuel pressure within a mechanical atomization system and fuel flow rate shall be maintained within the design range taking into account the viscosity and volatility of the fuel;
              (4) Rotary cup atomization systems. Fuel flow rate through a rotary cup atomization system must be maintained within the design range taking into account the viscosity and volatility of the fuel.

              § 266.111
              Standards for direct transfer.
              (a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces subject to §§ 266.102 or 266.103 if hazardous waste is directly transferred from a transport vehicle to a boiler or industrial furnace without the use of a storage unit.
              (b) Definitions. (1) When used in this section, the following terms have the meanings given below:
              
                Direct transfer equipment means any device (including but not limited to, such devices as piping, fittings, flanges, valves, and pumps) that is used to distribute, meter, or control the flow of hazardous waste between a container (i.e., transport vehicle) and a boiler or industrial furnace.
              
                Container means any portable device in which hazardous waste is transported, stored, treated, or otherwise handled, and includes transport vehicles that are containers themselves (e.g., tank trucks, tanker-trailers, and rail tank cars), and containers placed on or in a transport vehicle.
              (2) This section references several requirements provided in subparts I and J of parts 264 and 265. For purposes of this section, the term “tank systems” in those referenced requirements means direct transfer equipment as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (c) General operating requirements. (1) No direct transfer of a pumpable hazardous waste shall be conducted from an open-top container to a boiler or industrial furnace.
              (2) Direct transfer equipment used for pumpable hazardous waste shall always be closed, except when necessary to add or remove the waste, and shall not be opened, handled, or stored in a manner that may cause any rupture or leak.
              (3) The direct transfer of hazardous waste to a boiler or industrial furnace shall be conducted so that it does not:
              (i) Generate extreme heat or pressure, fire, explosion, or violent reaction;
              (ii) Produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health;
              (iii) Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions;
              (iv) Damage the structural integrity of the container or direct transfer equipment containing the waste;
              (v) Adversely affect the capability of the boiler or industrial furnace to meet the standards provided by §§ 266.104 through 266.107; or
              (vi) Threaten human health or the environment.
              (4) Hazardous waste shall not be placed in direct transfer equipment, if it could cause the equipment or its secondary containment system to rupture, leak, corrode, or otherwise fail.
              (5) The owner or operator of the facility shall use appropriate controls and practices to prevent spills and overflows from the direct transfer equipment or its secondary containment systems. These include at a minimum:
              (i) Spill prevention controls (e.g., check valves, dry discount couplings); and
              (ii) Automatic waste feed cutoff to use if a leak or spill occurs from the direct transfer equipment.
              (d) Areas where direct transfer vehicles (containers) are located. Applying the definition of container under this section, owners and operators must comply with the following requirements:
              (1) The containment requirements of § 264.175 of this chapter;
              (2) The use and management requirements of subpart I, part 265 of this chapter, except for §§ 265.170 and 265.174, and except that in lieu of the special requirements of § 265.176 for ignitable or reactive waste, the owner or operator may comply with the requirements for the maintenance of protective distances between the waste management area and any public ways, streets, alleys, or an adjacent property line that can be built upon as required in Tables 2-1 through 2-6 of the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) “Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code,” (1977 or 1981), (incorporated by reference, see § 260.11). The owner or operator must obtain and keep on file at the facility a written certification by the local Fire Marshall that the installation meets the subject NFPA codes; and
              (3) The closure requirements of § 264.178 of this chapter.
              (e) Direct transfer equipment. Direct transfer equipment must meet the following requirements:

              § 266.112
              Regulation of residues.
              A residue derived from the burning or processing of hazardous waste in a boiler or industrial furnace is not excluded from the definition of a hazardous waste under § 261.4(b) (4), (7), or (8) unless the device and the owner or operator meet the following requirements:
              (a) The device meets the following criteria:
              (1) Boilers. Boilers must burn at least 50% coal on a total heat input or mass input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of coal;
              (2) Ore or mineral furnaces. Industrial furnaces subject to § 261.4(b)(7) must process at least 50% by weight normal, nonhazardous raw materials;
              (3) Cement kilns. Cement kilns must process at least 50% by weight normal cement-production raw materials;
              (b) The owner or operator demonstrates that the hazardous waste does not significantly affect the residue by demonstrating conformance with either of the following criteria:
              (1) Comparison of waste-derived residue with normal residue. The waste-derived residue must not contain appendix VIII, part 261 constituents (toxic constituents) that could reasonably be attributable to the hazardous waste at concentrations significantly higher than in residue generated without burning or processing of hazardous waste, using the following procedure. Toxic compounds that could reasonably be attributable to burning or processing the hazardous waste (constituents of concern) include toxic constituents in the hazardous waste, and the organic compounds listed in appendix VIII of this part that may be generated as products of incomplete combustion. For polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans, analyses must be performed to determine specific congeners and homologues, and the results converted to 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent values using the procedure specified in section 4.0 of appendix IX of this part.
              (i) Normal residue. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in normal residue shall be determined based on analyses of a minimum of 10 samples representing a minimum of 10 days of operation. Composite samples may be used to develop a sample for analysis provided that the compositing period does not exceed 24 hours. The upper tolerance limit (at 95% confidence with a 95% proportion of the sample distribution) of the concentration in the normal residue shall be considered the statistically-derived concentration in the normal residue. If changes in raw materials or fuels reduce the statistically-derived concentrations of the toxic constituents of concern in the normal residue, the statistically-derived concentrations must be revised or statistically-derived concentrations of toxic constituents in normal residue must be established for a new mode of operation with the new raw material or fuel. To determine the upper tolerance limit in the normal residue, the owner or operator shall use statistical procedures prescribed in “Statistical Methodology for Bevill Residue Determinations” in appendix IX of this part.
              (ii) Waste-derived residue. Waste-derived residue shall be sampled and analyzed as often as necessary to determine whether the residue generated during each 24-hour period has concentrations of toxic constituents that are higher than the concentrations established for the normal residue under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If so, hazardous waste burning has significantly affected the residue and the residue shall not be excluded from the definition of a hazardous waste. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in the waste-derived residue shall be determined based on analysis of one or more samples obtained over a 24-hour period. Multiple samples may be analyzed, and multiple samples may be taken to form a composite sample for analysis provided that the sampling period does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to characterize waste-derived residues generated over a 24-hour period, the concentration of each toxic constituent shall be the arithmetic mean of the concentrations in the samples. No results may be disregarded; or
              (2) Comparison of waste-derived residue concentrations with health-based limits—(i) Nonmetal constituents: The concentration of each nonmetal toxic constituent of concern (specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) in the waste-derived residue must not exceed the health-based level specified in appendix VII of this part, or the level of detection, whichever is higher. If a health-based limit for a constituent of concern is not listed in appendix VII of this part, then a limit of 0.002 micrograms per kilogram or the level of detection (which must be determined by using appropriate analytical procedures), whichever is higher, must be used. The levels specified in appendix VII of this part (and the default level of 0.002 micrograms per kilogram or the level of detection for constituents as identified in Note 1 of appendix VII of this chapter) are administratively stayed under the condition, for those constituents specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the owner or operator complies with alternative levels defined as the land disposal restriction limits specified in § 268.43 of this chapter for F039 nonwastewaters. In complying with those alternative levels, if an owner or operator is unable to detect a constituent despite documenting use of best good-faith efforts as defined by applicable Agency guidance or standards, the owner or operator is deemed to be in compliance for that constituent. Until new guidance or standards are developed, the owner or operator may demonstrate such good-faith efforts by achieving a detection limit for the constituent that does not exceed an order of magnitude above the level provided by § 268.43 of this chapter for F039 nonwastewaters. In complying with the § 268.43 of this chapter F039 nonwastewater levels for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans, analyses must be performed for total hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, total hexachlorodibenzofurans, total pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, total pentachlorodibenzofurans, total tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, and total tetrachlorodibenzofurans.
              
              
                Note to this paragraph (b)(2)(i):

                The administrative stay, under the condition that the owner or operator complies with alternative levels defined as the land disposal restriction limits specified in § 268.43 of this chapter for F039 nonwastewaters, remains in effect until further administrative action is taken and notice is published in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations.
              
              
              (ii) Metal constituents. The concentration of metals in an extract obtained using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure of § 261.24 of this chapter must not exceed the levels specified in appendix VII of this part; and
              (iii) Sampling and analysis. Waste-derived residue shall be sampled and analyzed as often as necessary to determine whether the residue generated during each 24-hour period has concentrations of toxic constituents that are higher than the health-based levels. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in the waste-derived residue shall be determined based on analysis of one or more samples obtained over a 24-hour period. Multiple samples may be analyzed, and multiple samples may be taken to form a composite sample for analysis provided that the sampling period does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to characterize waste-derived residues generated over a 24-hour period, the concentration of each toxic constituent shall be the arithmetic mean of the concentrations in the samples. No results may be disregarded; and
              (c) Records sufficient to document compliance with the provisions of this section shall be retained until closure of the boiler or industrial furnace unit. At a minimum, the following shall be recorded.
              (1) Levels of constituents in appendix VIII, part 261, that are present in waste-derived residues;
              (2) If the waste-derived residue is compared with normal residue under paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
              (i) The levels of constituents in appendix VIII, part 261, that are present in normal residues; and
              (ii) Data and information, including analyses of samples as necessary, obtained to determine if changes in raw materials or fuels would reduce the concentration of toxic constituents of concern in the normal residue.

                Unexploded ordnance (UXO) means military munitions that have been primed, fused, armed, or otherwise prepared for action, and have been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installation, personnel, or material and remain unexploded either by malfunction, design, or any other cause.
            
            
              § 266.202
              Definition of solid waste.
              (a) A military munition is not a solid waste when:
              (1) Used for its intended purpose, including:
              (i) Use in training military personnel or explosives and munitions emergency response specialists (including training in proper destruction of unused propellant or other munitions); or
              (ii) Use in research, development, testing, and evaluation of military munitions, weapons, or weapon systems; or
              (iii) Recovery, collection, and on-range destruction of unexploded ordnance and munitions fragments during range clearance activities at active or inactive ranges. However, “use for intended purpose” does not include the on-range disposal or burial of unexploded ordnance and contaminants when the burial is not a result of product use.
              (2) An unused munition, or component thereof, is being repaired, reused, recycled, reclaimed, disassembled, reconfigured, or otherwise subjected to materials recovery activities, unless such activities involve use constituting disposal as defined in 40 CFR 261.2(c)(1), or burning for energy recovery as defined in 40 CFR 261.2(c)(2).
              (b) An unused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs:
              (1) The munition is abandoned by being disposed of, burned, detonated (except during intended use as specified in paragraph (a) of this section), incinerated, or treated prior to disposal; or
              (2) The munition is removed from storage in a military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of being disposed of, burned, or incinerated, or treated prior to disposal, or
              (3) The munition is deteriorated or damaged (e.g., the integrity of the munition is compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot be put into serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes; or
              (4) The munition has been declared a solid waste by an authorized military official.
              (c) A used or fired military munition is a solid waste:
              (1) When transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is not a range, for the purposes of storage, reclamation, treatment, disposal, or treatment prior to disposal; or
              (2) If recovered, collected, and then disposed of by burial, or landfilling either on or off a range.

              (d) For purposes of RCRA section 1004(27), a used or fired military munition is a solid waste, and, therefore, is potentially subject to RCRA corrective action authorities under sections 3004(u) and (v), and 3008(h), or imminent and substantial endangerment authorities under section 7003, if the munition lands off-range and is not promptly rendered safe and/or retrieved. Any imminent and substantial threats associated with any remaining material must be addressed. If remedial action is infeasible, the operator of the range must maintain a record of the event for as long as any threat remains. The record must include the type of munition and its location (to the extent the location is known).
            
            
              § 266.203
              Standards applicable to the transportation of solid waste military munitions.
              (a) Criteria for hazardous waste regulation of waste non-chemical military munitions in transportation. (1) Waste military munitions that are being transported and that exhibit a hazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261, are listed or identified as a hazardous waste (and thus are subject to regulation under 40 CFR parts 260 through 270), unless all the following conditions are met:
              (i) The waste military munitions are not chemical agents or chemical munitions;
              (ii) The waste military munitions must be transported in accordance with the Department of Defense shipping controls applicable to the transport of military munitions;
              (iii) The waste military munitions must be transported from a military owned or operated installation to a military owned or operated treatment, storage, or disposal facility; and
              (iv) The transporter of the waste must provide oral notice to the Director within 24 hours from the time the transporter becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military munitions, or any failure to meet a condition of paragraph (a)(1) of this section that may endanger health or the environment. In addition, a written submission describing the circumstances shall be provided within 5 days from the time the transporter becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military munitions or any failure to meet a condition of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (2) If any waste military munitions shipped under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not received by the receiving facility within 45 days of the day the waste was shipped, the owner or operator of the receiving facility must report this non-receipt to the Director within 5 days.
              (3) The exemption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section from regulation as hazardous waste shall apply only to the transportation of non-chemical waste military munitions. It does not affect the regulatory status of waste military munitions as hazardous wastes with regard to storage, treatment or disposal.
              (4) The conditional exemption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies only so long as all of the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met.
              (b) Reinstatement of exemption. If any waste military munition loses its exemption under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an application may be filed with the Director for reinstatement of the exemption from hazardous waste transportation regulation with respect to such munition as soon as the munition is returned to compliance with the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the Director finds that reinstatement of the exemption is appropriate based on factors such as the transporter's provision of a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances of the violation, or a demonstration that the violations are not likely to recur, the Director may reinstate the exemption under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the Director does not take action on the reinstatement application within 60 days after receipt of the application, then reinstatement shall be deemed granted, retroactive to the date of the application. However, the Director may terminate a conditional exemption reinstated by default in the preceding sentence if the Director finds that reinstatement is inappropriate based on factors such as the transporter's failure to provide a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances of the violation, or failure to demonstrate that the violations are not likely to recur. In reinstating the exemption under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Director may specify additional conditions as are necessary to ensure and document proper transportation to protect human health and the environment.
              (c) Amendments to DOD shipping controls. The Department of Defense shipping controls applicable to the transport of military munitions referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section are Government Bill of Lading (GBL) (GSA Standard Form 1109), requisition tracking form DD Form 1348, the Signature and Talley Record (DD Form 1907), Special Instructions for Motor Vehicle Drivers (DD Form 836), and the Motor Vehicle Inspection Report (DD Form 626) in effect on November 8, 1995, except as provided in the following sentence. Any amendments to the Department of Defense shipping controls shall become effective for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the date the Department of Defense publishes notice in the Federal Register that the shipping controls referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section have been amended.
            
            
              § 266.204
              Standards applicable to emergency responses.
              Explosives and munitions emergencies involving military munitions or explosives are subject to 40 CFR 262.10(i), 263.10(e), 264.1(g)(8), 265.1(c)(11), and 270.1(c)(3), or alternatively to 40 CFR 270.61.
            
            
              § 266.205
              Standards applicable to the storage of solid waste military munitions.
              (a) Criteria for hazardous waste regulation of waste non-chemical military munitions in storage. (1) Waste military munitions in storage that exhibit a hazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261, are listed or identified as a hazardous waste (and thus are subject to regulation under 40 CFR Parts 260 through 279), unless all the following conditions are met:
              (i) The waste military munitions are not chemical agents or chemical munitions.
              (ii) The waste military munitions must be subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB).
              (iii) The waste military munitions must be stored in accordance with the DDESB storage standards applicable to waste military munitions.
              (iv) Within 90 days of August 12, 1997 or within 90 days of when a storage unit is first used to store waste military munitions, whichever is later, the owner or operator must notify the Director of the location of any waste storage unit used to store waste military munitions for which the conditional exemption in paragraph (a)(1) is claimed.
              (v) The owner or operator must provide oral notice to the Director within 24 hours from the time the owner or operator becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military munitions, or any failure to meet a condition of paragraph (a)(1) that may endanger health or the environment. In addition, a written submission describing the circumstances shall be provided within 5 days from the time the owner or operator becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military munitions or any failure to meet a condition of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (vi) The owner or operator must inventory the waste military munitions at least annually, must inspect the waste military munitions at least quarterly for compliance with the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and must maintain records of the findings of these inventories and inspections for at least three years.
              (vii) Access to the stored waste military munitions must be limited to appropriately trained and authorized personnel.
              (2) The conditional exemption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section from regulation as hazardous waste shall apply only to the storage of non-chemical waste military munitions. It does not affect the regulatory status of waste military munitions as hazardous wastes with regard to transportation, treatment or disposal.
              (3) The conditional exemption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies only so long as all of the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met.
              (b) Notice of termination of waste storage. The owner or operator must notify the Director when a storage unit identified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section will no longer be used to store waste military munitions.

              (c) Reinstatement of conditional exemption. If any waste military munition loses its conditional exemption under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an application may be filed with the Director for reinstatement of the conditional exemption from hazardous waste storage regulation with respect to such munition as soon as the munition is returned to compliance with the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the Director finds that reinstatement of the conditional exemption is appropriate based on factors such as the owner's or operator's provision of a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances of the violation, or a demonstration that the violations are not likely to recur, the Director may reinstate the conditional exemption under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the Director does not take action on the reinstatement application within 60 days after receipt of the application, then reinstatement shall be deemed granted, retroactive to the date of the application. However, the Director may terminate a conditional exemption reinstated by default in the preceding sentence if he/she finds that reinstatement is inappropriate based on factors such as the owner's or operator's failure to provide a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances of the violation, or failure to demonstrate that the violations are not likely to recur. In reinstating the conditional exemption under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Director may specify additional conditions as are necessary to ensure and document proper storage to protect human health and the environment.
              (d) Waste chemical munitions. (1) Waste military munitions that are chemical agents or chemical munitions and that exhibit a hazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261, are listed or identified as a hazardous waste and shall be subject to the applicable regulatory requirements of RCRA subtitle C.
              (2) Waste military munitions that are chemical agents or chemical munitions and that exhibit a hazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261, are not subject to the storage prohibition in RCRA section 3004(j), codified at 40 CFR 268.50.

              (e) Amendments to DDESB storage standards. The DDESB storage standards applicable to waste military munitions, referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, are DOD 6055.9-STD (“DOD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards”), in effect on November 8, 1995, except as provided in the following sentence. Any amendments to the DDESB storage standards shall become effective for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the date the Department of Defense publishes notice in the Federal Register that the DDESB standards referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section have been amended.

              Storage and Treatment Conditional Exemption and Eligibility
              
                § 266.220
                What does a storage and treatment conditional exemption do?
                The storage and treatment conditional exemption exempts your low-level mixed waste from the regulatory definition of hazardous waste in 40 CFR 261.3 if your waste meets the eligibility criteria in § 266.225 and you meet the conditions in § 266.230.
              
              
                § 266.225
                What wastes are eligible for the storage and treatment conditional exemption?
                Low-level mixed waste (LLMW), defined in § 266.210, is eligible for this conditional exemption if it is generated and managed by you under a single NRC or NRC Agreement State license. (Mixed waste generated at a facility with a different license number and shipped to your facility for storage or treatment requires a permit and is ineligible for this exemption. In addition, NARM waste is ineligible this exemption.)
              
              
                § 266.230
                What conditions must you meet for your LLMW to qualify for and maintain a storage and treatment exemption?

                (a) For your LLMW to qualify for the exemption you must notify us in writing by certified delivery that you are claiming a conditional exemption for the LLMW stored on your facility. The dated notification must include your name, address, RCRA identification number, NRC or NRC Agreement State license number, the waste code(s) and storage unit(s) for which you are seeking an exemption, and a statement that you meet the conditions of this subpart. Your notification must be signed by your authorized representative who certifies that the information in the notification is true, accurate, and complete. You must notify us of your claim either within 90 days of the effective date of this rule in your State, or within 90 days of when a storage unit is first used to store conditionally exempt LLMW.
                (b) To qualify for and maintain an exemption for your LLMW you must:
                (1) Store your LLMW waste in tanks or containers in compliance with the requirements of your license that apply to the proper storage of low-level radioactive waste (not including those license requirements that relate solely to recordkeeping);
                (2) Store your LLMW in tanks or containers in compliance with chemical compatibility requirements of a tank or container in 40 CFR 264.177, or 264.199 or 40 CFR 265.177, or 265.199;
                (3) Certify that facility personnel who manage stored conditionally exempt LLMW are trained in a manner that ensures that the conditionally exempt waste is safely managed and includes training in chemical waste management and hazardous materials incidents response that meets the personnel training standards found in 40 CFR 265.16(a)(3);
                (4) Conduct an inventory of your stored conditionally exempt LLMW at least annually and inspect it at least quarterly for compliance with subpart N of this part; and
                (5) Maintain an accurate emergency plan and provide it to all local authorities who may have to respond to a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents. Your plan must describe emergency response arrangements with local authorities; describe evacuation plans; list the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all facility personnel qualified to work with local authorities as emergency coordinators; and list emergency equipment.
              
            
            
              Treatment
              
                § 266.235
                What waste treatment does the storage and treatment conditional exemption allow?
                You may treat your low-level mixed waste at your facility within a tank or container in accordance with the terms of your NRC or NRC Agreement State license. Treatment that cannot be done in a tank or container without a RCRA permit (such as incineration) is not allowed under this exemption.
              
            
            
              Loss of Conditional Exemption
              
                § 266.240
                How could you lose the conditional exemption for your LLMW and what action must you take?
                (a) Your LLMW will automatically lose the storage and treatment conditional exemption if you fail to meet any of the conditions specified in § 266.230. When your LLMW loses the exemption, you must immediately manage that waste which failed the condition as RCRA hazardous waste, and the storage unit storing the LLMW immediately becomes subject to RCRA hazardous waste container and/or tank storage requirements.
                (1) If you fail to meet any of the conditions specified in § 266.230 you must report to us and the NRC, or the oversight agency in the NRC Agreement State, in writing by certified delivery within 30 days of learning of the failure. Your report must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete. This report must include:
                (i) The specific condition(s) you failed to meet;
                (ii) A description of the LLMW (including the waste name, hazardous waste codes and quantity) and storage location at the facility; and
                (iii) The date(s) on which you failed to meet the condition(s).

                (2) If the failure to meet any of the conditions may endanger human health or the environment, you must also immediately notify us orally within 24 hours and follow up with a written notification within five days. Failures that may endanger human health or the environment include, but are not limited to, discharge of a CERCLA reportable quantity or other leaking or exploding tanks or containers, or detection of radionuclides above background or hazardous constituents in the leachate collection system of a storage area. If the failure may endanger human health or the environment, you must follow the provisions of your emergency plan.
                
                (b) We may terminate your conditional exemption for your LLMW, or require you to meet additional conditions to claim a conditional exemption, for serious or repeated noncompliance with any requirement(s) of subpart N of this part.
              
              
                § 266.245
                If you lose the storage and treatment conditional exemption for your LLMW, can the exemption be reclaimed?
                (a) You may reclaim the storage and treatment exemption for your LLMW if:
                (1) You again meet the conditions specified in § 266.230; and
                (2) You send us a notice by certified delivery that you are reclaiming the exemption for your LLMW. Your notice must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the information contained in your notice is true, complete, and accurate. In your notice you must do the following:
                (i) Explain the circumstances of each failure.
                (ii) Certify that you have corrected each failure that caused you to lose the exemption for your LLMW and that you again meet all the conditions as of the date you specify.
                (iii) Describe plans that you have implemented, listing specific steps you have taken, to ensure the conditions will be met in the future.
                (iv) Include any other information you want us to consider when we review your notice reclaiming the exemption.
                (b) We may terminate a reclaimed conditional exemption if we find that your claim is inappropriate based on factors including, but not limited to, the following: you have failed to correct the problem; you explained the circumstances of the failure unsatisfactorily; or you failed to implement a plan with steps to prevent another failure to meet the conditions of § 266.230. In reviewing a reclaimed conditional exemption under this section, we may add conditions to the exemption to ensure that waste management during storage and treatment of the LLMW will protect human health and the environment.
              
            
            
              Recordkeeping
              
                § 266.250
                What records must you keep at your facility and for how long?
                (a) In addition to those records required by your NRC or NRC Agreement State license, you must keep records as follows:
                (1) Your initial notification records, return receipts, reports to us of failure(s) to meet the exemption conditions, and all records supporting any reclaim of an exemption;
                (2) Records of your LLMW annual inventories, and quarterly inspections;
                (3) Your certification that facility personnel who manage stored mixed waste are trained in safe management of LLMW including training in chemical waste management and hazardous materials incidents response; and
                (4) Your emergency plan as specified in § 266.230(b).
                (b) You must maintain records concerning notification, personnel trained, and your emergency plan for as long as you claim this exemption and for three years thereafter, or in accordance with NRC regulations under 10 CFR part 20 (or equivalent NRC Agreement State regulations), whichever is longer. You must maintain records concerning your annual inventory and quarterly inspections for three years after the waste is sent for disposal, or in accordance with NRC regulations under 10 CFR part 20 (or equivalent NRC Agreement State regulations), whichever is longer.
              
            
            
              Reentry Into RCRA
              
                § 266.255
                When is your LLMW no longer eligible for the storage and treatment conditional exemption?
                (a) When your LLMW has met the requirements of your NRC or NRC Agreement State license for decay-in-storage and can be disposed of as non-radioactive waste, then the conditional exemption for storage no longer applies. On that date your waste is subject to hazardous waste regulation under the relevant sections of 40 CFR parts 260 through 271, and the time period for accumulation of a hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 262.16 or 262.17 begins.

                (b) When your conditionally exempt LLMW, which has been generated and stored under a single NRC or NRC Agreement State license number, is removed from storage, it is no longer eligible for the storage and treatment exemption. However, your waste may be eligible for the transportation and disposal conditional exemption at § 266.305.

              Storage Unit Closure
              
                § 266.260
                Do closure requirements apply to units that stored LLMW prior to the effective date of Subpart N?
                Interim status and permitted storage units that have been used to store only LLMW prior to the effective date of subpart N of this part and, after that date, store only LLMW which becomes exempt under this subpart N, are not subject to the closure requirements of 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. Storage units (or portions of units) that have been used to store both LLMW and non-mixed hazardous waste prior to the effective date of subpart N or are used to store both after that date remain subject to closure requirements with respect to the non-mixed hazardous waste.

                § 266.355
                How could you lose the transportation and disposal conditional exemption for your waste and what actions must you take?
                (a) Any waste will automatically lose the transportation and disposal exemption if you fail to manage it in accordance with all of the conditions specified in § 266.315.
                (1) When you fail to meet any of the conditions specified in § 266.315 for any of your wastes, you must report to us, in writing by certified delivery, within 30 days of learning of the failure. Your report must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete. This report must include:
                (i) The specific condition(s) that you failed to meet for the waste;
                (ii) A description of the waste (including the waste name, hazardous waste codes and quantity) that lost the exemption; and
                (iii) The date(s) on which you failed to meet the condition(s) for the waste.
                (2) If the failure to meet any of the conditions may endanger human health or the environment, you must also immediately notify us orally within 24 hours and follow up with a written notification within 5 days.
                (b) We may terminate your ability to claim a conditional exemption for your waste, or require you to meet additional conditions to claim a conditional exemption, for serious or repeated noncompliance with any requirement(s) of subpart N of this part.
              
              
                § 266.360
                If you lose the transportation and disposal conditional exemption for a waste, can the exemption be reclaimed?
                (a) You may reclaim the transportation and disposal exemption for a waste after you have received a return receipt confirming that we have received your notification of the loss of the exemption specified in § 266.355(a) and if:
                (1) You again meet the conditions specified in § 266.315 for the waste; and
                (2) You send a notice, by certified delivery, to us that you are reclaiming the exemption for the waste. Your notice must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete. The notice must:
                (i) Explain the circumstances of each failure.
                (ii) Certify that each failure that caused you to lose the exemption for the waste has been corrected and that you again meet all conditions for the waste as of the date you specify.
                (iii) Describe plans you have implemented, listing the specific steps that you have taken, to ensure that conditions will be met in the future.
                (iv) Include any other information you want us to consider when we review your notice reclaiming the exemption.
                (b) We may terminate a reclaimed conditional exemption if we find that your claim is inappropriate based on factors including, but not limited to: you have failed to correct the problem; you explained the circumstances of the failure unsatisfactorily; or you failed to implement a plan with steps to prevent another failure to meet the conditions of § 266.315. In reviewing a reclaimed conditional exemption under this section, we may add conditions to the exemption to ensure that transportation and disposal activities will protect human health and the environment.

              § 266.502
              Standards for healthcare facilities managing non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.
              (a) Notification and withdrawal from this subpart for healthcare facilities managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals—(1) Notification. A healthcare facility must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a healthcare facility operating under this subpart. A healthcare facility is not required to fill out Box 10.B. (Waste Codes for Federally Regulated Hazardous Waste) of the Site Identification Form with respect to its hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility must submit a separate notification (Site Identification Form) for each site or EPA identification number.
              (i) A healthcare facility that already has an EPA identification number must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a healthcare facility as part of its next Biennial Report, if it is required to submit one; or if not required to submit a Biennial Report, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.
              (ii) A healthcare facility that does not have an EPA identification number must obtain one by notifying the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a healthcare facility as part of its next Biennial Report, if it is required to submit one; or if not required to submit a Biennial Report, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.
              (iii) A healthcare facility must keep a copy of its notification on file for as long as the healthcare facility is subject to this subpart.
              (2) Withdrawal. A healthcare facility that operated under this subpart but is no longer subject to this subpart, because it is a very small quantity generator under § 262.14, and elects to withdraw from this subpart, must notify the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12) that it is no longer operating under this subpart. A healthcare facility is not required to fill out Box 10.B. (Waste Codes for Federally Regulated Hazardous Waste) of the Site Identification Form with respect to its hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility must submit a separate notification (Site Identification Form) for each EPA identification number.
              (i) A healthcare facility must submit the Site Identification Form notifying that it is withdrawing from this subpart before it begins operating under the conditional exemption of § 262.14.
              (ii) A healthcare facility must keep a copy of its withdrawal on file for three years from the date of signature on the notification of its withdrawal.
              (b) Training of personnel managing non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities. A healthcare facility must ensure that all personnel that manage non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are thoroughly familiar with proper waste handling and emergency procedures relevant to their responsibilities during normal facility operations and emergencies.
              (c) Hazardous waste determination for non-creditable pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility that generates a solid waste that is a non-creditable pharmaceutical must determine whether that pharmaceutical is a hazardous waste pharmaceutical (i.e., it exhibits a characteristic identified in 40 CFR part 261 subpart C or is listed in 40 CFR part 261 subpart D) in order to determine whether the waste is subject to this subpart. A healthcare facility may choose to manage its non-hazardous waste pharmaceuticals as non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under this subpart.
              (d) Standards for containers used to accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities. (1) A healthcare facility must place non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a container that is structurally sound, compatible with its contents, and that lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.
              (2) A healthcare facility that manages ignitable or reactive non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, or that mixes or commingles incompatible non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals must manage the container so that it does not have the potential to:
              (i) Generate extreme heat or pressure, fire or explosion, or violent reaction;
              (ii) Produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health;
              (iii) Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions;
              (iv) Damage the structural integrity of the container of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals; or
              (v) Through other like means threaten human health or the environment.
              (3) A healthcare facility must keep containers of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals closed and secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized access to its contents.

              (4) A healthcare facility may accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and non-hazardous non-creditable waste pharmaceuticals in the same container, except that non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals prohibited from being combusted because of the dilution prohibition of § 268.3(c) must be accumulated in separate containers and labeled with all applicable hazardous waste numbers (i.e., hazardous waste codes).
              (e) Labeling containers used to accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities. A healthcare facility must label or clearly mark each container of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals with the phrase “Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals.”
              (f) Maximum accumulation time for non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities. (1) A healthcare facility may accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for one year or less without a permit or having interim status.
              (2) A healthcare facility that accumulates non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on-site must demonstrate the length of time that the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals have been accumulating, starting from the date it first becomes a waste. A healthcare facility may make this demonstration by any of the following methods:
              (i) Marking or labeling the container of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals with the date that the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals became a waste;
              (ii) Maintaining an inventory system that identifies the date the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals being accumulated first became a waste;
              (iii) Placing the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a specific area and identifying the earliest date that any of the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in the area became a waste.
              (g) Land disposal restrictions for non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. The non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals generated by a healthcare facility are subject to the land disposal restrictions of 40 CFR part 268. A healthcare facility that generates non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals must comply with the land disposal restrictions in accordance with § 268.7(a) requirements, except that it is not required to identify the hazardous waste numbers (i.e., hazardous waste codes) on the land disposal restrictions notification.
              (h) Procedures for healthcare facilities for managing rejected shipments of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility that sends a shipment of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to a designated facility with the understanding that the designated facility can accept and manage the waste, and later receives that shipment back as a rejected load in accordance with the manifest discrepancy provisions of § 264.72 or § 265.72 of this chapter may accumulate the returned non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for up to an additional 90 days provided the rejected or returned shipment is managed in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. Upon receipt of the returned shipment, the healthcare facility must:
              (1) Sign either:
              (i) Item 18c of the original manifest, if the original manifest was used for the returned shipment; or
              (ii) Item 20 of the new manifest, if a new manifest was used for the returned shipment;
              (2) Provide the transporter a copy of the manifest;
              (3) Within 30 days of receipt of the rejected shipment, send a copy of the manifest to the designated facility that returned the shipment to the healthcare facility; and
              (4) Within 90 days of receipt of the rejected shipment, transport or offer for transport the returned shipment in accordance with the shipping standards of § 266.508(a).
              (i) Reporting by healthcare facilities for non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals—(1) Biennial reporting by healthcare facilities. Healthcare facilities are not subject to biennial reporting requirements under § 262.41, with respect to non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals managed under this subpart.
              (2) Exception reporting by healthcare facilities for a missing copy of the manifest—(i) For shipments from a healthcare facility to a designated facility. (A) If a healthcare facility does not receive a copy of the manifest with the signature of the owner or operator of the designated facility within 60 days of the date the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals were accepted by the initial transporter, the healthcare facility must submit:
              (1) A legible copy of the original manifest, indicating that the healthcare facility has not received confirmation of delivery, to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the healthcare facility is located; and
              (2) A handwritten or typed note on the manifest itself, or on an attached sheet of paper, stating that the return copy was not received and explaining the efforts taken to locate the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and the results of those efforts.
              (B) [Reserved]
              (ii) For shipments rejected by the designated facility and shipped to an alternate facility.

              Residues of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in empty containers.
              (a) Stock, dispensing and unit-dose containers. A stock bottle, dispensing bottle, vial, or ampule (not to exceed 1 liter or 10,000 pills); or a unit-dose container (e.g., a unit-dose packet, cup, wrapper, blister pack, or delivery device) is considered empty and the residues are not regulated as hazardous waste provided the pharmaceuticals have been removed from the stock bottle, dispensing bottle, vial, ampule, or the unit-dose container using the practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container.
              (b) Syringes. A syringe is considered empty and the residues are not regulated as hazardous waste under this subpart provided the contents have been removed by fully depressing the plunger of the syringe. If a syringe is not empty, the syringe must be placed with its remaining hazardous waste pharmaceuticals into a container that is managed and disposed of as a non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical under this subpart and any applicable federal, state, and local requirements for sharps containers and medical waste.
              (c) Intravenous (IV) bags. An IV bag is considered empty and the residues are not regulated as hazardous waste provided the pharmaceuticals in the IV bag have been fully administered to a patient. If an IV bag is not empty, the IV bag must be placed with its remaining hazardous waste pharmaceuticals into a container that is managed and disposed of as a non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical under this subpart, unless the IV bag held non-acute hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and is empty as defined in § 261.7(b)(1).
              (d) Other containers, including delivery devices. Hazardous waste pharmaceuticals remaining in all other types of unused, partially administered, or fully administered containers must be managed as non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under this subpart, unless the container held non-acute hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and is empty as defined in § 261.7(b)(1) or (2).

              § 266.509
              Shipping potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals from a healthcare facility or a reverse distributor to a reverse distributor.
              (a) Shipping potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility or a reverse distributor who transports or offers for transport potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals off-site to a reverse distributor must comply with all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR part 171 through 180 for any potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical that meets the definition of hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8. For purposes of the Department of Transportation regulations, a material is considered a hazardous waste if it is subject to the Hazardous Waste Manifest Requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency specified in 40 CFR part 262. Because a potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical does not require a manifest, it is not considered hazardous waste under the Department of Transportation regulations.
              (b) Delivery confirmation. Upon receipt of each shipment of potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the receiving reverse distributor must provide confirmation (paper or electronic) to the healthcare facility or reverse distributor that initiated the shipment that the shipment of potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals has arrived at its destination and is under the custody and control of the reverse distributor.
              (c) Procedures for when delivery confirmation is not received within 35 calendar days. If a healthcare facility or reverse distributor initiates a shipment of potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to a reverse distributor and does not receive delivery confirmation within 35 calendar days from the date that the shipment of potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals was sent, the healthcare facility or reverse distributor that initiated the shipment must contact the carrier and the intended recipient (i.e., the reverse distributor) promptly to report that the delivery confirmation was not received and to determine the status of the potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.
              (d) Exporting potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility or reverse distributor that sends potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to a foreign destination must comply with the applicable sections of 40 CFR part 262 subpart H, except the manifesting requirement of § 262.83(c), in addition to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
              (e) Importing potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. Any person that imports potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals into the United States is subject to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section in lieu of 40 CFR part 262 subpart H.

              (a) Standards for reverse distributors managing potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals—(1) Notification. A reverse distributor must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a reverse distributor operating under this subpart.
              (i) A reverse distributor that already has an EPA identification number must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a reverse distributor, as defined in § 266.500, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.

              (ii) A reverse distributor that does not have an EPA identification number must obtain one by notifying the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a reverse distributor, as defined in § 266.500, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.
              
              (2) Inventory by the reverse distributor. A reverse distributor must maintain a current inventory of all the potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are accumulated on site.
              (i) A reverse distributor must inventory each potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical within 30 calendar days of each waste arriving at the reverse distributor.
              (ii) The inventory must include the identity (e.g., name or national drug code) and quantity of each potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical.
              (iii) If the reverse distributor already meets the inventory requirements of this paragraph because of other regulatory requirements, such as State Board of Pharmacy regulations, the facility is not required to provide a separate inventory pursuant to this section.
              (3) Evaluation by a reverse distributor that is not a manufacturer. A reverse distributor that is not a pharmaceutical manufacturer must evaluate a potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical within 30 calendar days of the waste arriving at the reverse distributor to establish whether it is destined for another reverse distributor for further evaluation or verification of manufacturer credit or for a permitted or interim status treatment, storage, or disposal facility.
              (i) A potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical that is destined for another reverse distributor is still considered a “potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical” and must be managed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
              (ii) A potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical that is destined for a permitted or interim status treatment, storage or disposal facility is considered an “evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical” and must be managed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
              (4) Evaluation by a reverse distributor that is a manufacturer. A reverse distributor that is a pharmaceutical manufacturer must evaluate a potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical to verify manufacturer credit within 30 calendar days of the waste arriving at the facility and following the evaluation must manage the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
              (5) Maximum accumulation time for hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at a reverse distributor. (i) A reverse distributor may accumulate potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for 180 calendar days or less. The 180 days start after the potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical has been evaluated and applies to all hazardous waste pharmaceuticals accumulated on site, regardless of whether they are destined for another reverse distributor (i.e., potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals) or a permitted or interim status treatment, storage, or disposal facility (i.e., evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals).
              (ii) Aging pharmaceuticals. Unexpired pharmaceuticals that are otherwise creditable but are awaiting their expiration date (i.e., aging in a holding morgue) can be accumulated for up to 180 days after the expiration date, provided that the unexpired pharmaceuticals are managed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and the container labeling and management standards in 266.510(c)(4)(i) through (vi).
              (6) Security at the reverse distributor facility. A reverse distributor must prevent unknowing entry and minimize the possibility for the unauthorized entry into the portion of the facility where potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are kept.
              (i) Examples of methods that may be used to prevent unknowing entry and minimize the possibility for unauthorized entry include, but are not limited to:
              (A) A 24-hour continuous monitoring surveillance system;
              (B) An artificial barrier such as a fence; or

              (C) A means to control entry, such as keycard access.
              
              (ii) If the reverse distributor already meets the security requirements of this paragraph because of other regulatory requirements, such as Drug Enforcement Administration or State Board of Pharmacy regulations, the facility is not required to provide separate security measures pursuant to this section.
              (7) Contingency plan and emergency procedures at a reverse distributor. A reverse distributor that accepts potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals from off site must prepare a contingency plan and comply with the other requirements of 40 CFR part 262 subpart M.
              (8) Closure of a reverse distributor. When closing an area where a reverse distributor accumulates potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals or evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the reverse distributor must comply with § 262.17(a)(8)(ii) and (iii).
              (9) Reporting by a reverse distributor—(i) Unauthorized waste report. A reverse distributor must submit an unauthorized waste report if the reverse distributor receives waste from off site that it is not authorized to receive (e.g., non-pharmaceutical hazardous waste, regulated medical waste). The reverse distributor must prepare and submit an unauthorized waste report to the EPA Regional Administrator within 45 calendar days after the unauthorized waste arrives at the reverse distributor and must send a copy of the unauthorized waste report to the healthcare facility (or other entity) that sent the unauthorized waste. The reverse distributor must manage the unauthorized waste in accordance with all applicable regulations. The unauthorized waste report must be signed by the owner or operator of the reverse distributor, or its authorized representative, and contain the following information:
              (A) The EPA identification number, name and address of the reverse distributor;

              (C) Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions;
              
              (D) Damage the structural integrity of the container of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals; or
              (E) Through other like means threaten human health or the environment; and

              (vi) Accumulate evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are prohibited from being combusted because of the dilution prohibition of § 268.3(c) (e.g., arsenic trioxide (P012)) in separate containers from other evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at the reverse distributor.
              (5) Hazardous waste numbers. Prior to shipping evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals off site, all containers must be marked with the applicable hazardous waste numbers (i.e., hazardous waste codes). A nationally recognized electronic system, such as bar coding or radio frequency identification, may be used to identify the EPA Hazardous Waste Number(s).
              (6) Shipments. A reverse distributor must ship evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are destined for a permitted or interim status treatment, storage or disposal facility in accordance with the applicable shipping standards in § 266.508(a) or (b).
              (7) Procedures for a reverse distributor for managing rejected shipments. A reverse distributor that sends a shipment of evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to a designated facility with the understanding that the designated facility can accept and manage the waste, and later receives that shipment back as a rejected load in accordance with the manifest discrepancy provisions of § 264.72 or § 265.72 of this chapter, may accumulate the returned evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for up to an additional 90 days in the on-site accumulation area provided the rejected or returned shipment is managed in accordance with § 266.510(a) and (c). Upon receipt of the returned shipment, the reverse distributor must:
              (i) Sign either:
              (A) Item 18c of the original manifest, if the original manifest was used for the returned shipment; or
              (B) Item 20 of the new manifest, if a new manifest was used for the returned shipment;
              (ii) Provide the transporter a copy of the manifest;
              (iii) Within 30 days of receipt of the rejected shipment of the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, send a copy of the manifest to the designated facility that returned the shipment to the reverse distributor; and
              (iv) Within 90 days of receipt of the rejected shipment, transport or offer for transport the returned shipment of evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in accordance with the applicable shipping standards of § 266.508(a) or (b).
              (8) Land disposal restrictions. Evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are subject to the land disposal restrictions of 40 CFR part 268. A reverse distributor that accepts potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals from off site must comply with the land disposal restrictions in accordance with § 268.7(a) requirements.
              (9) Reporting by a reverse distributor for evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals—(i) Biennial reporting by a reverse distributor.

              (A) For shipments from a reverse distributor to a designated facility. (1) If a reverse distributor does not receive a copy of the manifest with the signature of the owner or operator of the designated facility within 35 days of the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals were accepted by the initial transporter, the reverse distributor must contact the transporter or the owner or operator of the designated facility to determine the status of the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.
              (2) A reverse distributor must submit an exception report to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the reverse distributor is located if it has not received a copy of the manifest with the signature of the owner or operator of the designated facility within 45 days of the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical was accepted by the initial transporter. The exception report must include:
              (i) A legible copy of the manifest for which the reverse distributor does not have confirmation of delivery; and
              (ii) A cover letter signed by the reverse distributor, or its authorized representative, explaining the efforts taken to locate the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and the results of those efforts.
              (B) For shipments rejected by the designated facility and shipped to an alternate facility. (1) A reverse distributor that does not receive a copy of the manifest with the signature of the owner or operator of the alternate facility within 35 days of the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals were accepted by the initial transporter must contact the transporter or the owner or operator of the alternate facility to determine the status of the hazardous waste. The 35-day time frame begins the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are accepted by the transporter forwarding the hazardous waste shipment from the designated facility to the alternate facility.
              (2) A reverse distributor must submit an Exception Report to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the reverse distributor is located if it has not received a copy of the manifest with the signature of the owner or operator of the alternate facility within 45 days of the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals were accepted by the initial transporter. The 45-day timeframe begins the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are accepted by the transporter forwarding the hazardous waste pharmaceutical shipment from the designated facility to the alternate facility. The Exception Report must include:
              (i) A legible copy of the manifest for which the generator does not have confirmation of delivery; and
              (ii) A cover letter signed by the reverse distributor, or its authorized representative, explaining the efforts taken to locate the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and the results of those efforts.
              (10) Recordkeeping by a reverse distributor for evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. (i) A reverse distributor must keep a log (written or electronic) of the inspections of the on-site accumulation area, required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This log must be retained as a record for at least three years from the date of the inspection.
              (ii) A reverse distributor must keep a copy of each manifest signed in accordance with § 262.23(a) for three years or until it receives a signed copy from the designated facility that received the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical. This signed copy must be retained as a record for at least three years from the date the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical was accepted by the initial transporter.
              (iii) A reverse distributor must keep a copy of each biennial report for at least three years from the due date of the report.
              (iv) A reverse distributor must keep a copy of each exception report for at least three years from the submission of the report.
              (v) A reverse distributor must keep records to document personnel training, in accordance with § 262.17(a)(7)(iv).
              (vi) All records must be readily available upon request by an inspector. The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity, or as requested by the EPA Regional Administrator.
              (d) When a reverse distributor must have a permit. A reverse distributor is an operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility and is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 264, 265, and 267 and the permit requirements of 40 CFR part 270, if the reverse distributor:
              (1) Does not meet the conditions of this section;

              8. Alternate Methodology for Implementing Metals Controls.
              a. Sampling and analytical methods for multiple metals, hexavalent chromium, HCl and chlorine, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, and aldehydes and ketones can be found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes, Physical/Chemical Methods” (EPA Publication SW-846). Additional methods referenced in subpart H of part 266 but not included in this document can be found in 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, and SW-846.

              b. The CEM performance specifications of section 2.0, the relevant sampling Methods 0011, 0023A, 0050, 0051, 0060, and 0061 of SW-846, incorporated by reference in § 260.11, and the toxicity equivalency procedure for dioxins and furans of section 4.0 are required procedures for determining compliance with BIF regulations. For the determination of chloride from HCl/Cl2 emission sampling train, you must use appropriate methods. For the determination of carbonyl compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography, you must use appropriate methods. The CEM performance specifications are interim. The finalized CEM performance specifications will be published in 40 CFR parts 60 and 61.
              Section 2.0 Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems
              2.1 Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste
              2.1.1 Applicability and Principle

              2.1.1.1 Applicability. These performance specifications apply to carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs) installed on incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. The specifications include procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS at all times.
              2.1.1.2 Principle. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the specifications. Calibration drift, relative accuracy, calibration error, and response time tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.
              2.1.2 Definitions
              2.1.2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). A continuous monitor is one in which the sample to be analyzed passes the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption, and which evaluates the detector response to the sample at least once each 15 seconds and computes and records the results at least every 60 seconds. A CEMS consists of all the equipment used to acquire data and includes the sample extraction and transport hardware, the analyzer(s), and the data recording/processing hardware and software.
              2.1.2.2 Monitoring System Types. The specifications require CEMSs capable of accepting calibration gases. Alternative system designs may be used if approved by the Regional Administrator. There are two basic types of monitoring systems: extractive and in-situ.
              2.1.2.2.1 Extractive. Systems that use a pump or other mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic means to draw a sample of the stack or flue gas and convey it to a remotely located analyzer.
              2.1.2.2.2 In-situ. Systems that perform an analysis without removing a sample from the stack. Point in-situ analyzers place the sensing or detecting element directly in the flue gas stream. Cross-stack in-situ analyzers measure the parameter of interest by placing a source beam on one side of the stack and the detector (in single-pass instruments) or a retroreflector (in double-pass instruments) on the other side, and measuring the parameter of interest (e.g., CO) by the attenuation of the beam by the gas in its path.
              2.1.2.3 Instrument Measurement Range. The difference between the minimum and maximum concentration that can be measured by a specific instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumed to be zero and the range expressed only as the maximum.
              2.1.2.4 Span or Span Value. Full scale instrument measurement range.
              2.1.2.5 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. A CD test is performed to demonstrate the stability of the CEMS calibration over time.
              2.1.2.6 Response Time. The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input (e.g., change of calibration gas) and the time when the data recorder displays 95 percent of the final value.
              2.1.2.7 Accuracy. A measure of agreement between a measured value and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage difference between the true and measured values relative to the true value. For these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by conducting a calibration error (CE) test and a relative accuracy (RA) test. Certain facilities, such as those using solid waste or batch-fed processes, may observe long periods of almost no CO emissions with brief, high-level CO emission spikes. These facilities, as well as facilities whose CO emissions never exceed 5-10 ppm, may need to be exempted from the RA requirement because the RA test procedure cannot ensure acquisition of meaningful test results under these conditions. An alternative procedure for accuracy determination is described in section 2.1.9.
              2.1.2.8 Calibration Error (CE). The difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of the cylinder gas. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy and linearity of the monitoring equipment over the entire measurement range.

              2.1.2.9 Relative Accuracy (RA). A comparison of the CEMS response to a value measured by a performance test method (PTM). The RA test is used to validate the calibration technique and verify the ability of the CEMS to provide representative and accurate measurements.

              2.1.2.10 Performance Test Method (PTM). The sampling and analysis procedure used to obtain reference measurements for comparison to CEMS measurements. The applicable test methods are Method 10, 10A, or 10B (for the determination of CO) and Method 3 or 3A (for the determination of O2). These methods are found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              2.1.2.11 Performance Specification Test (PST) Period. The period during which CD, CE, response time, and RA tests are conducted.
              2.1.2.12 Centroidal Area. A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.
              2.1.3 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications
              2.1.3.1 CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations. The CEMS shall be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion situation in the firebox. The location should be as free from in-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be checked as described in Section 2.1.3.3 to determine whether the location would cause failure of the relative accuracy test.
              2.1.3.1.1 For extractive or point in-situ CEMSs, the measurement point should be within or centrally located over the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.
              2.1.3.1.2 For cross-stack CEMSs, the effective measurement path should (1) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area or (2) be centrally located over any part of the centroidal area.
              2.1.3.1.3 Both the CO and O2 monitors should be installed at the same general location. If this is not possible, they may be installed at different locations if the effluent gases at both sample locations are not stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between sampling locations.
              2.1.3.2 Performance Test Method (PTM) Measurement Location and Traverse Points.

              2.1.3.2.1 Select an accessible PTM measurement point at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of CO generation, or other point at which a change in the CO concentration may occur, and at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (e.g., air heater leakages) and CO and O2 are simultaneously measured at the same location, one half diameter may be used in place of two equivalent diameters. The CEMS and PTM locations need not be the same.
              2.1.3.2.2 Select traverse points that ensure acquisition of representative samples over the stack or duct cross section. At a minimum, establish a measurement line that passes through the centroidal area in the direction of any expected stratification. If this line interferes with the CEMS measurements, displace the line up to 30 cm (or 5 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is less) from the centroidal area. Locate three traverse points at 17, 50, and 83 percent of the measurement line. If the measurement line is no longer than 2.4 meters and pollutant stratification is not expected, the tester may choose to locate the three traverse points on the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. This option must not be used at a site located within eight equivalent diameters downstream of a flow disturbance. The tester may select other traverse points, provided that they can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator to provide a representative sample over the stack or duct cross-section. Conduct all necessary PTM tests within 3 cm of the selected traverse points. Sampling must not be performed within 3 cm of the duct or stack inner wall.

              2.1.3.3 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in method 1, appendix A, 40 CFR part 60. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.
              2.1.4 CEMS Performance and Equipment Specifications
              Table 2.1-1 summarizes the performance specifications for the CEMSs. Two sets of standards for CO are given; one for low-range and another for high-range measurements. The high-range specifications relate to measurement and quantification of short duration high concentration peaks, while the low-range specifications relate to the overall average operating condition of the burning device. The dual-range specifications can be met by using (1) one analyzer for each range, (2) a dual range unit, or (3) a single measurement range instrument capable of meeting both specifications with a single unit. Adjustments cannot be made to the analyzer between determinations of low- and high-level accuracy within the single measurement range. In the second case, when the concentration exceeds the span of the lower range, the data acquisition system recorder shall switch to the high range automatically.
              2.1.4.1 CEMS Span Value. In order to measure high and low concentrations with the same or similar degree of accuracy, the maximum ranges (span values) are specified for low and high range analyzers. The span values are listed in Table 2.1-2. Tier I and Tier II format definitions are established in 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.

For a single measurement range monitor, three CO calibration gas concentrations (or calibration filters for in-situ systems) shall be used, i.e., the zero and high-level concentrations of the low-range CO analyzer and the high-level concentration of the high-range CO analyzer.
              2.1.4.2.1 The zero level for the CO or O2 analyzer may be between zero and 20 percent of the span value, e.g., 0-40 ppm for low-range CO analyzer, 0-600 ppm for the high-range CO analyzer, and 0-5 percent for the O2 analyzer (for Tier I).

              2.1.4.2.2 The high-level concentration for the CO or O2 analyzer shall be between 50 and 90 percent of the span value, i.e., 100-180 ppm for the low-range CO analyzer, 1500-2700 ppm for the high-range CO analyzer, and 12.5-22.5 percent O2 for the O2 analyzer.

              2.1.4.3 Data Recorder Scale. The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be capable of recording all readings within the CEMS's measurement range and shall have a resolution of 0.5 percent of span value, i.e., 1 ppm CO for low-range CO analyzer, 15 ppm CO for high-range CO analyzer, and 0.1 percent O2 for the O2 analyzer.

              2.1.4.4 Response Time. The response time for the CO or O2 monitor shall not exceed 2 minutes to achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.

              2.1.4.5 Calibration Drift. The CEMS must allow the determination of CD at the zero and high-level values. The CD must be determined separately for CO and O2 monitors in terms of concentration. The CO CEMS calibration response must not drift or deviate from the reference value of the calibration gas (or calibration filters for in-situ systems) by more than 3 percent of the span value after each 24-hour period of the 7-day test, i.e., 6 ppm CO for the low-range analyzer (Tier I) and 90 ppm for the high-range analyzer, at both zero and high levels. The O2 monitor calibration response must not drift or deviate from the reference value by more than 0.5 percent O2 at both zero and high ­levels.
              

              2.1.4.6 Relative Accuracy. The result of the RA test of the CO CEMS (which incorporates the O2 monitor) must be no greater than 10 percent of the mean value of the PTM results or must be within 10 ppm CO of the PTM results, whichever is less restrictive. The ppm CO concentration shall be corrected to 7 percent O2 before calculating the RA.

              2.1.4.7 Calibration Error. The mean difference between the CEMS and reference values at all three test points (see Table 2.1-3) must be no greater than 5 percent of span value for CO monitors (i.e., 10 ppm CO for low range Tier I CO analyzers and 150 ppm CO for high range CO analyzers) and 0.5 percent for O2 analyzers.
              2.1.4.8 Measurement and Recording Frequency. The sample to be analyzed shall pass through the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption. The detector shall measure the sample concentration at least once every 15 seconds. An average emission rate shall be computed and recorded at least once every 60 seconds.
              2.1.4.9 Hourly Rolling Average Calculation. The CEMS shall calculate every minute an hourly rolling average, which is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values.
              2.1.4.10 Retest. If the CEMS produces results within the specified criteria, the test is successful. If the CEMS does not meet one or more of the criteria, the necessary corrections must be made and the performance tests repeated.
              2.1.5 Test Periods
              2.1.5.1 Pretest Preparation Period. Install the CEMS, prepare the PTM test site according to the specifications in section 2.1.3, and prepare the CEMS for operation and calibration according to the manufacturer's written instructions. A pretest conditioning period similar to that of the 7-day CD test is recommended to verify the operational status of the CEMS.
              2.1.5.2 Calibration Drift Test Period. While the facility is operating under normal conditions, determine the CD at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days according to the procedure given in section 2.1.6.1. All CD determinations must be made following a 24-hour period during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. If the combustion unit is taken out of service during the test period, record the onset and duration of the downtime and continue the calibration drift test when the unit resumes operation.

              2.1.5.3 Relative Accuracy Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure in section 2.1.6.4 while the facility is operating under normal conditions. RA testing for CO and O2 shall be conducted simultaneously so that the results can be calculated for CO corrected to 7 percent O2. The RA test shall be conducted during the CD test period. It is emphasized that during the CD test period, no adjustments or repairs may be made to the CEMS other than routine calibration adjustments performed immediately following the daily CD determination.
              2.1.5.4 Calibration Error Test and Response Time Test Periods. Conduct the CE and response time tests during the CD test period.
              2.1.6 Performance Specification Test Procedures
              2.1.6.1 Calibration Drift Test.
              2.1.6.1.1 Sampling Strategy. Conduct the CD test for all monitors at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days using calibration gases at the two (or three, if applicable) concentration levels specified in section 2.1.4.2. Introduce the calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas shall pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other CEMS components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference (calibration gas) value. To meet the specification, none of the differences shall exceed the limits specified in Table 2.1-1.
              2.1.6.1.2 Calculations. Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example is shown in Figure 2.1-1. Calculate the differences between the CEMS responses and the reference values.
              2.1.6.2 Response Time. Check the entire CEMS including sample extraction and transport, sample conditioning, gas analyses, and the data recording.
              2.1.6.2.1 Introduce zero gas into the system. For extractive systems, introduce the calibration gases at the probe as near to the sample location as possible. For in-situ system, introduce the zero gas at a point such that all components active in the analysis are tested. When the system output has stabilized (no change greater than 1 percent of full scale for 30 seconds), switch to monitor stack effluent and wait for a stable value. Record the time (upscale response time) required to reach 95 percent of the final stable value.
              2.1.6.2.2 Next, introduce a high-level calibration gas and repeat the above procedure. Repeat the entire procedure three times and determine the mean upscale and downscale response times. The longer of the two means is the system response time.
              2.1.6.3 Calibration Error Test Procedure.

              2.1.6.3.1 Sampling Strategy. Challenge each monitor (both low- and high-range CO and O2) with zero gas and EPA Protocol 1 cylinder gases at three measurement points within the ranges specified in Table 2.1-3.

              2.1.6.3.1.1 If a single measurement range is used, the calibration gases used in the daily CD checks (if they are Protocol 1 cylinder gases and meet the criteria in section 2.1.6.3.1) may be used for determining CE.

              2.1.6.3.1.2 Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode as nearly as possible. The calibration gas shall be injected into the sample system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical and should pass through all CEMS components used during normal sampling. Challenge the CEMS three non-consecutive times at each measurement point and record the responses. The duration of each gas injection should be sufficient to ensure that the CEMS surfaces are conditioned.
              2.1.6.3.2 Calculations. Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example data sheet is shown in Figure 2.1-2. Average the differences between the instrument response and the certified cylinder gas value for each gas. Calculate three CE results (five CE results for a single-range CO CEMS) according to Equation 5 (section 2.1.7.5). No confidence coefficient is used in CE calculations.
              2.1.6.4 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.

              2.1.6.4.1 Sampling Strategy for PTM tests. Conduct the PTM tests in such a way that they will yield measurements representative of the emissions from the source and can be correlated to the CEMS data. Although it is preferable to conduct the CO, diluent, and moisture (if needed) simultaneously, moisture measurements that are taken within a 60-minute period which includes the simultaneous CO and O2 measurements may be used to calculate the dry CO concentration.
              
              
                Note:
                At times, CEMS RA tests may be conducted during incinerator performance tests. In these cases, PTM results obtained during CEMS RA tests may be used to determine compliance with incinerator emissions limits as long as the source and test conditions are consistent with the applicable regulations.

              2.1.6.4.2 Performance Test Methods.

              2.1.6.4.2.1 Unless otherwise specified in the regulations, method 3 or 3A and method 10, 10A, or 10B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) are the test methods for O2 and CO, respectively. Make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for 7 minutes at each of three traverse points (see section 3.2).

              2.1.6.4.2.2 When the installed CEMS uses a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer, method 10 shall use the alternative interference trap specified in section 10.1 of the method. An option, which may be approved by the Administrator in certain cases, would allow the test to be conducted using method 10 without the interference trap. Under this option, a laboratory interference test is performed for the analyzer prior to the field test. The laboratory interference test includes the analysis of SO2, NO, and CO2 calibration gases over the range of expected effluent concentrations. Acceptable performance is indicated if the CO analyzer response to each of the gases is less than 1 percent of the applicable measurement range of the analyzer.
              2.1.6.4.3 Number of PTM Tests. Conduct a minimum of nine sets of all necessary PTM tests. If more than nine sets are conducted, a maximum of three sets may be rejected at the tester's discretion. The total number of sets used to determine the RA must be greater than or equal to nine. All data, including the rejected data, must be reported.

              2.1.6.4.4 Correlation of PTM and CEMS Data. The time and duration of each PTM test run and the CEMS response time should be considered in correlating the data. Use the CEMS final output (the one used for reporting) to determine an integrated average CO concentration for each PTM test run. Confirm that the pair of results are on a consistent moisture and O2 concentration basis. Each integrated CEMS value should then be compared against the corresponding average PTM value. If the CO concentration measured by the CEMS is normalized to a specified diluent concentration, the PTM results shall be normalized to the same value.
              2.1.6.4.5 Calculations. Summarize the results on a data sheet. Calculate the mean of the PTM values and calculate the arithmetic differences between the PTM and the CEMS data sets. The mean of the differences, standard deviation, confidence coefficient, and CEMS RA should be calculated using Equations 1 through 4.

              2.1.7.1 Arithmetic Mean (d). Calculate d of the difference of a data set using Equation 1.

              2.1.8 Reporting
              At a minimum, summarize in tabular form the results of the CD, RA, response time, and CE test, as appropriate. Include all data sheets, calculations, CEMS data records, and cylinder gas or reference material certifications.
              2.1.9 Alternative Procedure
              2.1.9.1 Alternative RA Procedure Rationale. Under some operating conditions, it may not be possible to obtain meaningful results using the RA test procedure. This includes conditions where consistent, very low CO emissions or low CO emissions interrupted periodically by short duration, high level spikes are observed. It may be appropriate in these circumstances to waive the PTM RA test and substitute the following procedure.
              2.1.9.2 Alternative RA Procedure. Conduct a complete CEMS status check following the manufacturer's written instructions. The check should include operation of the light source, signal receiver, timing mechanism functions, data acquisition and data reduction functions, data recorders, mechanically operated functions (mirror movements, calibration gas valve operations, etc.), sample filters, sample line heaters, moisture traps, and other related functions of the CEMS, as applicable. All parts of the CEMS must be functioning properly before the RA requirement can be waived. The instruments must also have successfully passed the CE and CD requirements of the performance specifications. Substitution of the alternative procedure requires approval of the Regional Administrator.
              2.1.10 Quality Assurance (QA)
              Proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS is the responsibility of the owner or operator. The owner or operator must establish a QA program to evaluate and monitor CEMS performance. As a minimum, the QA program must include:
              2.1.10.1 A daily calibration check for each monitor. The calibration must be adjusted if the check indicates the instrument's CD exceeds the specification established in section 2.1.4.5. The gases shall be injected as close to the probe as possible to provide a check of the entire sampling system. If an alternative calibration procedure is desired (e.g., direct injections or gas cells), subject to Administrator approval, the adequacy of this alternative procedure may be demonstrated during the initial 7-day CD test. Periodic comparisons of the two procedures are suggested.
              2.1.10.2 A daily system audit. The audit must include a review of the calibration check data, an inspection of the recording system, an inspection of the control panel warning lights, and an inspection of the sample transport and interface system (e.g., flowmeters, filters), as appropriate.
              2.1.10.3 A quarterly calibration error (CE) test. Quarterly RA tests may be substituted for the CE test when approved by the Director on a case-by-case basis.
              2.1.10.4 An annual performance specification test.

              2.2 Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring of Hydrocarbons for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste
              2.2.1 Applicability and Principle
              2.2.1.1 Applicability. These performance specifications apply to hydrocarbon (HC) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs) installed on incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. The specifications include procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS at all times.

              2.2.1.2 Principle. A gas sample is extracted from the source through a heated sample line and heated filter (except as provided by section 2.2.10) to a flame ionization detector (FID). Results are reported as volume concentration equivalents of propane. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the specifications. Calibration drift, calibration error, and response time tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.
              2.2.2 Definitions
              2.2.2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). The total equipment used to acquire data, which includes sample extraction and transport hardware, analyzer, data recording and processing hardware, and software. The system consists of the following major subsystems:
              2.2.2.1.1 Sample Interface. That portion of the system that is used for one or more of the following: Sample acquisition, sample transportation, sample conditioning, or protection of the analyzer from the effects of the stack effluent.
              2.2.2.1.2 Organic Analyzer. That portion of the system that senses organic concentration and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration.
              2.2.2.1.3 Data Recorder. That portion of the system that records a permanent record of the measurement values. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities.
              2.2.2.2 Instrument Measurement Range. The difference between the minimum and maximum concentration that can be measured by a specific instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumed to be zero and the range expressed only as the maximum.
              2.2.2.3 Span or Span Value. Full scale instrument measurement range.
              2.2.2.4 Calibration Gas. A known concentration of a gas in an appropriate diluent gas.
              2.2.2.5 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. A CD test is performed to demonstrate the stability of the CEMS calibration over time.
              2.2.2.6 Response Time. The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input (e.g., change of calibration gas) and the time when the data recorder displays 95 percent of the final value.
              2.2.2.7 Accuracy. A measurement of agreement between a measured value and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage difference between the true and measured values relative to the true value. For these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by conducting a calibration error (CE) test.
              2.2.2.8 Calibration Error (CE). The difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of the cylinder gas. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy and linearity of the monitoring equipment over the entire measurement range.
              2.2.2.9 Performance Specification Test (PST) Period. The period during which CD, CE, and response time tests are conducted.
              2.2.2.10 Centroidal Area. A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.
              2.2.3 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications
              2.2.3.1 CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations. The CEMS shall be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion situation in the firebox. The location should be as free from in-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be investigated as described in section 2.2.3.2. The measurement point shall be within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.

              2.2.3.2 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, method 1. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.
              2.2.4 CEMS Performance and Equipment Specifications
              If this method is applied in highly explosive areas, caution and care shall be exercised in choice of equipment and installation.

              2.2.4.1 Flame Ionization Detector (FID) Analyzer. A heated FID analyzer capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements of these specifications. Heated systems shall maintain the temperature of the sample gas between 150 °C (300 °F) and 175 °C (350 °F) throughout the system. This requires all system components such as the probe, calibration valve, filter, sample lines, pump, and the FID to be kept heated at all times such that no moisture is condensed out of the system.
              
              
                Note:
                As specified in the regulations, unheated HC CEMs may be considered an acceptable interim alternative monitoring technique. For additional notes, see section 2.2.10. The essential components of the measurement system are described below:
              
              
              2.2.4.1.1 Sample Probe. Stainless steel, or equivalent, to collect a gas sample from the centroidal area of the stack cross-section.

              2.2.4.1.2 Sample Line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport the sample to the analyzer.
              
              
                Note:
                Mention of trade names or specific products does not constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
              
              
              2.2.4.1.3 Calibration Valve Assembly. A heated three-way valve assembly to direct the zero and calibration gases to the analyzer is recommended. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route calibration gas to the analyzers are applicable.
              2.2.4.1.4 Particulate Filter. An in-stack or out-of-stack sintered stainless steel filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated.
              2.2.4.1.5 Fuel. The fuel specified by the manufacturer (e.g., 40 percent hydrogen/60 percent helium, 40 percent hydrogen/60 percent nitrogen gas mixtures, or pure hydrogen) should be used.
              2.2.4.1.6 Zero Gas. High purity air with less than 0.1 parts per million by volume (ppm) HC as methane or carbon equivalent or less than 0.1 percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
              2.2.4.1.7 Calibration Gases. Appropriate concentrations of propane gas (in air or nitrogen). Preparation of the calibration gases should be done according to the procedures in EPA Protocol 1. In addition, the manufacturer of the cylinder gas should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change by more than ±2 percent from the certified value.
              2.2.4.2 CEMS Span Value. 100 ppm propane.
              2.2.4.3 Daily Calibration Gas Values. The owner or operator must choose calibration gas concentrations that include zero and high-level calibration values.
              2.2.4.3.1 The zero level may be between 0 and 20 ppm (zero and 20 percent of the span value).
              2.2.4.3.2 The high-level concentration shall be between 50 and 90 ppm (50 and 90 percent of the span value).
              2.2.4.4 Data Recorder Scale. The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be capable of recording all readings within the CEMS's measurement range and shall have a resolution of 0.5 ppm (0.5 percent of span value).
              2.2.4.5 Response Time. The response time for the CEMS must not exceed 2 minutes to achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.
              2.2.4.6 Calibration Drift. The CEMS must allow the determination of CD at the zero and high-level values. The CEMS calibration response must not differ by more than ±3 ppm (±3 percent of the span value) after each 24-hour period of the 7-day test at both zero and high levels.
              2.2.4.7 Calibration Error. The mean difference between the CEMS and reference values at all three test points listed below shall be no greater than 5 ppm (±5 percent of the span value).
              2.2.4.7.1 Zero Level. Zero to 20 ppm (0 to 20 percent of span value).
              2.2.4.7.2 Mid-Level. 30 to 40 ppm (30 to 40 percent of span value).
              2.2.4.7.3 High-Level. 70 to 80 ppm (70 to 80 percent of span value).
              2.2.4.8 Measurement and Recording Frequency. The sample to be analyzed shall pass through the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption. The detector shall measure the sample concentration at least once every 15 seconds. An average emission rate shall be computed and recorded at least once every 60 seconds.
              2.2.4.9 Hourly Rolling Average Calculation. The CEMS shall calculate every minute an hourly rolling average, which is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values.
              2.2.4.10 Retest. If the CEMS produces results within the specified criteria, the test is successful. If the CEMS does not meet one or more of the criteria, necessary corrections must be made and the performance tests repeated.
              2.2.5 Performance Specification Test (PST) Periods

              2.2.5.1 Pretest Preparation Period. Install the CEMS, prepare the PTM test site according to the specifications in section 2.2.3, and prepare the CEMS for operation and calibration according to the manufacturer's written instructions. A pretest conditioning period similar to that of the 7-day CD test is recommended to verify the operational status of the CEMS.
              2.2.5.2 Calibration Drift Test Period. While the facility is operating under normal conditions, determine the magnitude of the CD at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days according to the procedure given in section 2.2.6.1. All CD determinations must be made following a 24-hour period during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. If the combustion unit is taken out of service during the test period, record the onset and duration of the downtime and continue the CD test when the unit resumes operation.
              2.2.5.3 Calibration Error Test and Response Time Test Periods. Conduct the CE and response time tests during the CD test period.
              2.2.6 Performance Specification Test Procedures
              2.2.6.1 Calibration Drift Test.
              2.2.6.1.1 Sampling Strategy. Conduct the CD test at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days using calibration gases at the two daily concentration levels specified in section 2.2.4.3. Introduce the two calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas shall pass through all CEM components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference (calibration gas) value. To meet the specification, none of the differences shall exceed 3 ppm.
              2.2.6.1.2 Calculations. Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example is shown in Figure 2.2-1. Calculate the differences between the CEMS responses and the reference values.
              2.2.6.2 Response Time. The entire system including sample extraction and transport, sample conditioning, gas analyses, and the data recording is checked with this procedure.
              2.2.6.2.1 Introduce the calibration gases at the probe as near to the sample location as possible. Introduce the zero gas into the system. When the system output has stabilized (no change greater than 1 percent of full scale for 30 sec), switch to monitor stack effluent and wait for a stable value. Record the time (upscale response time) required to reach 95 percent of the final stable value.
              2.2.6.2.2 Next, introduce a high-level calibration gas and repeat the above procedure. Repeat the entire procedure three times and determine the mean upscale and downscale response times. The longer of the two means is the system response time.
              2.2.6.3 Calibration Error Test Procedure.
              2.2.6.3.1 Sampling Strategy. Challenge the CEMS with zero gas and EPA Protocol 1 cylinder gases at measurement points within the ranges specified in section 2.2.4.7.
              2.2.6.3.1.1 The daily calibration gases, if Protocol 1, may be used for this test.

              2.2.9 Quality Assurance (QA)
              Proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS is the responsibility of the owner or operator. The owner or operator must establish a QA program to evaluate and monitor CEMS performance. As a minimum, the QA program must include:
              2.2.9.1 A daily calibration check for each monitor. The calibration must be adjusted if the check indicates the instrument's CD exceeds 3 ppm. The gases shall be injected as close to the probe as possible to provide a check of the entire sampling system. If an alternative calibration procedure is desired (e.g., direct injections or gas cells), subject to Administrator approval, the adequacy of this alternative procedure may be demonstrated during the initial 7-day CD test. Periodic comparisons of the two procedures are suggested.

              2.2.9.2 A daily system audit. The audit must include a review of the calibration check data, an inspection of the recording system, an inspection of the control panel warning lights, and an inspection of the sample transport and interface system (e.g., flowmeters, filters), as appropriate.
              2.2.9.3 A quarterly CE test. Quarterly RA tests may be substituted for the CE test when approved by the Director on a case-by-case basis.
              2.2.9.4 An annual performance specification test.
              2.2.10 Alternative Measurement Technique
              The regulations allow gas conditioning systems to be used in conjunction with unheated HC CEMs during an interim period. This gas conditioning may include cooling to not less than 40 °F and the use of condensate traps to reduce the moisture content of sample gas entering the FID to less than 2 percent. The gas conditioning system, however, must not allow the sample gas to bubble through the condensate as this would remove water soluble organic compounds. All components upstream of the conditioning system should be heated as described in section 2.2.4 to minimize operating and maintenance problems.

              Section 4.0 Procedure for Estimating the Toxicity Equivalence of Chlorinated Dibenzo-P-Dioxin and Dibenzofuran Congeners
              PCDDs and PCDFs must be determined using whichever is the most recent version between of SW-846 Method 0023A (incorporated by reference, in § 260.11) as identified, or OAQPS Method 23 of appendix A to part 60. In this method, individual congeners or homologues 1
                 are measured and then summed to yield a total PCDD/PCDF value. No toxicity factors are specified in the method to compute risks from such emissions.
              
                
                  1 The term “congener” refers to any one particular member of the same chemical family; e.g., there are 75 congeners of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. The term “homologue” refers to a group of structurally related chemicals that have the same degree of chlorination. For example, there are eight homologues of CDs, monochlorinated through octachlorinated. Dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans that are chlorinated at the 2,3,7, and 8 positions are denoted as “2378” congeners, except when 2,3,7,8-TCDD is uniquely referred to: e.g., 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF are both referred to as “2378-PeCDFs.”
              
              For the purpose of estimating risks posed by emissions from boilers and industrial furnaces, however, specific congeners and homologues must be measured using the specified method and then multiplied by the assigned toxicity equivalence factors (TEFs), using procedures described in “Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Dibenzofurans (CDDs and CDFs) and 1989 Update,” EPA/625/3-89/016, March 1989. The resulting 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents value is used in the subsequent risk calculations and modeling efforts as discussed in the BIF final rule.
              The procedure for calculating the 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent is as follows:
              1. Using method 23, determine the concentrations of 2,7,3,8-congeners of various PCDDs and PCDFs in the sample.
              2. Multiply the congener concentrations in the sample by the TEF listed in Table 4.0-1 to express the congener concentrations in terms of 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent. Note that congeners not chlorinated at 2,3,7, and 8 positions have a zero toxicity factor in this table.
              3. Add the products obtained in step 2, to obtain the total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent in the sample.
              Sample calculations are provided in EPA document No. EPA/625/3-89/016, March 1989, which can be obtained from the EPA, ORD Publications Office, Cincinnati, Ohio (Phone no. 513-569-7562).

              Section 5.0 Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality Screening Procedure
              The HWCAQSP is a combined calculation/reference table approach for conservatively estimating short-term and annual average facility impacts for stack emissions. The procedure is based on extensive short-term modeling of 11 generic source types and on a set of adjustment factors for estimating annual average concentrations from short-term concentrations. Facility impacts may be determined based on the selected worst-case stack or on multiple stacks, in which the impacts from each stack are estimated separately and then added to produce the total facility impact.
              This procedure is most useful for facilities with multiple stacks, large source-to-property boundary distances, and complex terrain between 1 and 5 km from the facility. To ensure a sufficient degree of conservatism, the HWCAQSP may not be used if any of the five screening procedure limitations listed below are true:
              • The facility is located in a narrow valley less than 1 km wide;
              • The facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is located such that the terrain rises to the stack height within 1 km of the facility;
              • The facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is located within 5 km of the shoreline of a large body of water;
              • The facility property line is within 200 m of the stack and the physical stack height is less than 10 m; or
              • On-site receptors are of concern, and stack height is less than 10 m.
              If any of these criteria are met or the Director determines that this procedure is not appropriate, then detailed site-specific modeling or modeling using the “Screening Procedures for Estimating the Air Quality Impact of Stationary Sources,” EPA-450/4-88-010, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, August 1988, is required. Detailed site-specific dispersion modeling must conform to the EPA “Guidance on Air Quality Models (Revised)”, EPA 450/2-78-027R, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 1986. This document provides guidance on both the proper selection and regulatory application of air quality models.
              Introduction
              The Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality Screening Procedure (HWCAQSP) (also referred to hereafter as “the screening procedure” or “the procedure”) provides a quick, easy method for estimating maximum (hourly) and annual average ambient air impacts associated with the combustion of hazardous waste. The methodology is conservative in nature and estimates dispersion coefficients 1
                 based on facility-specific information.
              
                
                  1 The term dispersion coefficient refers to the change in ambient air concentration (µg/m3) resulting from a source with an emission rate of 1 g/sec.
              
              The screening procedure can be used to determine emissions limits at sites where the nearest meteorological (STAR) station is not representative of the meteorology at the site. If the screen shows that emissions from the site are adequately protective, then the need to collect site-specific meteorological data can be eliminated.
              The screening procedure is generally most helpful for facilities meeting one or more of the following conditions:
              • Multiple stacks with substantially different release specifications (e.g., stack heights differ by >50 percent, exit temperatures differ by >50 °K, or the exit flow rates differ by more than a factor of 2),

              • Terrain located between 1 km and 5 km from the site increases in elevation by more than the physical height of the shortest stack (i.e., the facility is located in complex terrain), or
              • Significant distance between the facility's stacks and the site boundary [guidance on determining whether a distance is “significant” is provided in Step 6(B) of the procedure].
              Steps 1 through 9 of the screening procedure present a simplified method for determining emissions based on the use of the “worst-case” stack. If the simplified method shows that desired feed rates result in emissions that exceed allowable limits for one or more pollutants, a refined analysis to examine the emissions from each stack can be conducted. This multiple-stack method is presented in Step 10.

              The steps involved in screening methodology are as follows:
              
              Step 1. Define Source Characteristics
              
              Step 2. Determine the Applicability of the Screening Procedure
              Step 3. Select the Worst-Case Stack
              Step 4. Verify Good Engineering Practice (GEP) Criteria
              Step 5. Determine the Effective Stack Height and Terrain-Adjusted Effective Stack Height
              Step 6. Classify the Site as Urban or Rural
              Step 7. Determine Maximum Dispersion Coefficients
              Step 8. Estimate Maximum Ambient Air Concentrations
              Step 9. Determine Compliance With Regulatory Limits
              
              
                
                  2 Worksheet space is provided for three stacks. If the facility has additional stacks, copy the form and revise stack identification numbers for 4, 5, etc.

              If the answer is “no” to all the preceding questions, then the HWCAQSP is acceptable. If the answer to any question is “yes”, the procedure is not acceptable.
              Step 3: Select the Worst-Case Stack
              If the facility has several stacks, a worst-case stack must be chosen to conservatively represent release conditions at the facility. Follow the steps below to identify the worst-case stack.
              Apply the following equation to each stack:
              
              K = HVT
              
              where:
              
              K = an arbitrary parameter accounting for the relative influence of the stack height and plume rise.
              H = Physical stack height (m)
              V = Flow rate (m3/sec)
              T = Exhaust temperature (°K)
              
              Complete the following table to compute the “K” value for each stack:
              
                
                  Stack No.

              Select the stack with the lowest “K” value. This is the worst-case stack that will be used for Steps 4 through 9.
              
              Worst-Case Stack is identified as Stack No. ___
              Step 4: Verify Good Engineering Practice (GEP) Criteria

              Confirm that the selected worst-case stack meets Good Engineering Practice (GEP) criteria. The stack height to be used in the subsequent steps of this procedure must not be greater than the maximum GEP. Maximum and minimum GEP stack heights are defined as follows:
              
              CEP (minimum) = H + (1.5 × L)
              GEP (maximum) = greater of 65 m or H + (1.5 × L)
              
              where:
              
              H = height of the building selected in Step 1 measured from ground level elevation at the base of the stack
              L = the lesser dimension of the height or projected width of the building selected in Step 1
              Record the following data for the worst-case stack:
              Stack height (m)=_____
              H(m)=_____
              L(m)=_____
              
              Then compute the following:
              
              GEP (minimum) (m)=_____
              GEP (maximum) (m)=_____
              
              • If the physical height of the worst-case stack exceeds the maximum GEP, then use the maximum GEP stack height for the subsequent steps of this analysis;
              • If the physical height of the worst-case stack is less than the minimum GEP, then use generic source number 11 as the selected source for further analysis and proceed directly to Step 6;
              • If the physical height of the worst-case stack is between the minimum and maximum GEP, then use the actual physical stack height for the subsequent steps of this analysis.
              Step 5: Determine the Effective Stack Height and the Terrain-Adjusted Effective Stack Height (TAESH)
              The effective stack height is an important factor in dispersion modeling. The effective stack height is the physical height of the stack plus plume rise. As specified in Step 4, the stack height used to estimate the effective stack height must not exceed GEP requirements. Plume rise is a function of the stack exit gas temperature and flow rate.
              In this analysis, the effective stack height is used to select the generic source that represents the dispersion characteristics of the facility. For facilities located in flat terrain and for all facilities with worst-case stacks less than or equal to 10 meters in height, generic source numbers are selected strictly on the basis of effective stack height. In all other cases, the effective stack height is further adjusted to take into account the terrain rise near the facility. This “terrain-adjusted effective stack height” (TAESH) is then used to select the generic source number that represents the dispersion characteristics of the facility. Follow the steps below to identify the effective stack height, the TAESH (where applicable), and the corresponding generic source number.
              (A) Go to Table 5.0-1 and find the plume rise value corresponding to the stack temperature and exit flow rate for the worst-case stack determined in Step 3.
              Plume rise=____(m)
              (B) Add the plume rise to the GEP stack height of the worst-case stack determined in Steps 3 and 4.

                  Effective stack height (m)

                   + 
                  ____
                  =
                  ____
                
              
              (C) Go to the first column of Table 5.0-2 and identify the range of effective stack heights that includes the effective stack height estimated in Step 5(B). Record the generic source number that corresponds to this range.
              Generic source number=_____
              (D) If the source is located in flat terrain 3
                , or if the generic source number identified in Step 5(C) above is 1 or 11 (regardless of terrain classification), use the generic source number determined in Step 5(C) and proceed directly to Step 6. Otherwise, continue to Step 5(E).
              
                
                  3 The terrain is considered flat and terrain adjustment factors are not used if the maximum terrain rise within 5 km of the facility (see Step 1) is less than 10 percent of the physical stack height of the worst-case stack.
              

              (E) For those situations where the conditions in Step 5(D) do not apply, the effective stack height must be adjusted for terrain. The TAESH for each distance range is computed by subtracting the terrain rise within the distance range from the effective stack height. 4
                
              
              
                
                  4 Refer to Step 1 for terrain adjustment data. Note that the distance from the source to the outer radii of each range is used. For example, for the range >0.5-2.5 km, the maximum terrain rise in the range 0.0-2.5 km is used.

              Step 6: Classify the Site as Urban or Rural
              (A) Classify the land use near the facility as either urban or rural by determining the percentage of urban land use types (as defined in Table 3; for further guidance see the footnoted references) that fall within 3 km of the facility. 5
                
              
              
                
                  5 The delineation of urban and rural areas can be difficult for the residential-type areas listed in Table 5.0-3. The degree of resolution in Table 5.0-3 for residential areas often cannot be identified without conducting site area inspections. This process can require extensive analysis, which, for many applications, can be greatly streamlined without sacrificing confidence in selecting the appropriate urban or rural classification. The fundamental simplifying assumption is based on the premise that many applications will have clear-cut urban/rural designations, i.e., most will be in rural settings that can be definitively characterized through a review of aerial photographs, zoning maps, or U.S. Geological Survey topographical maps.

              (m): __
              Minimum distance from any stack to property boundary (m): __
              
              If the minimum distance between any stack and the nearest facility boundary is greater than the threshold distance, the surrounding buffer distance is considered significant and the facility is likely to benefit from use of the HWCAQSP relative to the Tier I and II limits (see discussion of benefits from using HWCAQSP in Introduction section).
              Step 7: Determine Maximum Dispersion Coefficients
              (A) Determine maximum average hourly dispersion coefficients. Based on the results of Step 6(A), select either Table 5.0-4 (urban) or Table 5.0-5 (rural) to determine the maximum average hourly dispersion coefficient. 6

                 For flat terrain [defined in Step 5(D)] and for all sites with generic source numbers 1 or 11, use Step 7(A) (1). For rolling or complex terrain (excluding generic sources numbers 1 and 11), use Step 7(A) (2).
              
                
                  6 For the distance range 6 to 20 kilometers, generic source number 1 is used to conservatively represent the maximum dispersion coefficient.
              
              (1) Search down the appropriate generic source number column [based on Step 5(C)], beginning at the minimum fenceline distance listed in Step 6(B). 7
                 Record the maximum average hourly dispersion coefficient encountered.
              
                
                  7 Exclude all distances that are closer to the facility than the property boundary. For example, if the actual distance to the nearest property boundary is 265 meters, begin at the 300 meter distance in Tables 5.0-4 and 5.0-5.
              
              Maximum Average Hourly Dispersion Coefficient=__(µg/m3/g/sec)
              (2) For each of the three distance-based generic source numbers listed in Step 5(E), search down the appropriate generic source number columns, beginning at the minimum fenceline distance listed in Step 6(B). Note that different columns may be used for each of the three distance ranges if there is a need for terrain adjustment. Record the maximum dispersion coefficient for each generic source number.

              (B) Determine annual/hourly ratio for rural analysis. The maximum average annual dispersion coefficient is approximated by multiplying the maximum hourly dispersion coefficient (identified in Step 7(A)) by the appropriate ratio selection from Table 5.0-6. The generic source number(s) [from Steps 5(C) or 5(E)], urban/rural designation (from Step 6), and the terrain type are used to select the appropriate scaling factor. Use the noncomplex terrain designation for all sources located in flat terrain, for all sources where the physical stack height of the worst-case stack is less than or equal to 10 m, for all sources where the worst-case stack is less than the minimum GEP, and for those sources where all of the TAESH values in Step 5(E) are greater than zero. Use the complex terrain designation in all other situations.
              (C) Determine maximum average annual dispersion coefficient. The maximum average annual dispersion coefficient is determined by multiplying the maximum hourly dispersion coefficient (Step 7(A)) by its corresponding annual/hourly ratio (Step 7(B)).

              Step 9: Determine Compliance with Regulatory Limits—see procedures prescribed in subpart H of 40 CFR part 266.
              Step 10: Multiple Stack Method (Optional)
              This option is a special case procedure that may be helpful when (1) the facility exceeded the regulatory limits for one or more pollutants, as detailed in Step 9, and (2) the facility has multiple stacks with substantially different emission rates and effective release heights. Only those pollutants that fail the Step 9 screening limits need to be addressed in this exercise.
              This procedure assesses the environmental impacts from each stack and then sums the results to estimate total impacts. This option is conceptually the same as the basic approach (Steps 1 through 9) and does not involve complex calculations. However, it is more time-consuming and is recommended only if the basic approach fails to meet the risk criteria. The procedure is outlined below.
              (A) Compute effective stack heights for each stack. 8
                
              
              
                
                  8 Follow the procedure outlined in Step 4 of the basic screening procedure to determine the GEP for each stack. If a stack's physical height exceeds the maximum GEP, use the maximum GEP values. If a stack's physical height is less than the minimum GEP, use generic source number 11 in the subsequent steps of this analysis. Follow the procedure in Steps 5(A) and 5(B) to determine the effective height of each stack.

              (B) Determine if this multiple-stack screening procedure will likely produce less conservative results than the procedure in Steps 1 through 9. To do this, compute the ratio of maximum-to-minimum effective stack height:
              
                EC06NO91.012
              

              If the above ratio is greater than 1.25, proceed with the remaining steps. Otherwise, this option is less likely to significantly reduce the degree of conservatism in the screening method.
              
              (C) Determine if terrain adjustment is needed and select generic source numbers. Select the shortest stack height and maximum terrain rise out to 5 km from Step 1 and determine if the facility is in flat terrain.

              Maximum terrain rise in meters out to 5 km=

              If the value above is greater than 10 percent, the terrain is considered nonflat; proceed to Step 10(D). If the ratio is less than or equal to 10 percent, the terrain is considered flat. Identify the generic source numbers based on effective stack heights computed in Step 10(A). Refer to Table 5.0-2 provided earlier to identify generic source numbers. Record the generic source numbers identified and proceed to Step 10(F).

              For those stacks where the terrain rise within a distance range is greater than the effective stack height (i.e., HE−TR is less than zero), the TAESH for that distance range is set equal to zero, and generic source number 1 should be used for that distance range for all subsequent distance ranges. Additionally, for all stacks with a physical stack height of less than or equal to 10 meters, use generic source number 1 for all distance ranges. 10
                 For the remaining stacks, proceed to Step 10(D)(2).

              (E) Identify maximum average hourly dispersion coefficients. Based on the land use classification of the site (e.g., urban or rural), use either Table 5.0-4 or Table 5.0-5 to determine the appropriate dispersion coefficient for each distance range for each stack. Begin at the minimum fenceline distance indicated in Step 7(B) and record on Worksheet 5.0-1 the dispersion coefficient for each stack/distance range. For stacks located in facilities in flat terrain, the generic source numbers were computed in Step 10(C). For stacks located in facilities in rolling and complex terrain, the generic source numbers were computed in Step 10(D). For flat terrain applications and for stacks with a physical height of less than or equal to 10 meters, only one generic source number is used per stack for all distance ranges. For other situations up to three generic source numbers may be needed per stack (i.e., a unique generic source number per distance range). In Tables 5.0-4 and 5.0-5, the dispersion coefficients for distances of 6 km to 20 km are the same for all generic source numbers in order to conservatively represent terrain beyond 5 km (past the limits of the terrain analysis).

              (F) Estimate maximum hourly ambient air concentrations. In this step, pollutant-specific emission rates are multiplied by appropriate dispersion coefficients to estimate ambient air concentrations. For each stack, emissions are multiplied by the dispersion coefficient selected in Step 10(E) and summed across all stacks to estimate ambient air concentrations at various distances from the facility. From these summed concentrations, the maximum hourly ambient air concentration is selected. First, select the maximum emission rate of the pollutant. 11

              (G) Determine the complex/noncomplex designation for each stack. For each stack, subtract the maximum terrain rise within 5 km of the site from the physical stack height and designate the stack as either complex or noncomplex. If the stack height minus the maximum terrain rise (within 5 km) is greater than zero or if the stack is less than 10 meters in physical height, then assign the stack a noncomplex designation. If the stack height minus the maximum terrain rise (within 5 km) is less than or equal to zero, then assign the stack a complex designation.
              
              Perform the following computation for each stack and record the information in the spaces provided. Check in the spaces provided whether the stack designation is complex or noncomplex.

                  14 As an option, the user can identify the stack with the highest ratio for each distance range (rather than the absolute highest). In this case, extra sheets would be needed to show estimated annual average concentrations from each stack by multiplying emission rate times maximum hourly dispersion coefficient times maximum annual/hourly ratio for applicable distance range. Then sum across all stacks for each downwind distance.

              Section 6.0 Simplified Land Use Classification Procedure for Compliance With Tier I and Tier II Limits
              6.1 Introduction
              This section provides a simplified procedure to classify areas in the vicinity of boilers and industrial furnace sites as urban or rural in order to set risk-based emission limits under subpart H of 40 CFR part 266. Urban/rural classification is needed because dispersion rates differ between urban and rural areas and thus, the risk per unit emission rate differs accordingly. The combination of greater surface roughness (more buildings/structures to generate turbulent mixing) and the greater amount of heat released from the surface in an urban area (generates buoyancy-induced mixing) produces greater rates of dispersion. The emission limit tables in the regulation, therefore, distinguish between urban and rural areas.
              EPA guidance (EPA 1986) 1 provides two alternative procedures to determine whether the character of an area is predominantly urban or rural. One procedure is based on land use typing and the other is based on population density. Both procedures require consideration of characteristics within a 3-km radius from a source, in this case the facility stack(s). The land use typing method is preferred because it more directly relates to the surface characteristics that affect dispersion rates. The remainder of this discussion is, therefore, focused on the land use method.

              While the land use method is more direct, it can also be labor-intensive to apply. For this discussion, the land use method has been simplified so that it is consistent with EPA guidance (EPA 1986; Auer 1978), while streamlining the process for the majority of applications so that a clear-cut decision can be made without the need for detailed analysis. Table 6.0-1 summarizes the simplified approach for classifying areas as urban or rural. As shown, the applicant always has the option of applying standard (i.e., more detailed) analyses to more accurately distinguish between urban and rural areas. However, the procedure presented here allows for simplified determinations, where appropriate, to expedite the permitting process.

              6.2 Simplified Land Use Process
              The land use approach considers four primary land use types: industrial (I), commercial (C), residential (R), and agricultural (A). Within these primary classes, subclasses are identified, as shown in table 6.0-1. The goal is to estimate the percentage of the area within a 3-km radius that is urban type and the percentage that is rural type. Industrial and commercial areas are classified as urban; agricultural areas are classified as rural.
              The delineation of urban and rural areas, however, can be more difficult for the residential type areas shown in table 6.0-1. The degree of resolution shown in table 6.0-1 for residential areas often cannot be identified without conducting site area inspections and/or referring to zoning maps. This process can require extensive analysis, which, for many applications, can be greatly streamlined without sacrificing confidence in selecting the appropriate urban or rural classification.
              The fundamental simplifying assumption is based on the premise that many applications will have clear-cut urban/rural designations, i.e., most will be in rural settings that can be definitively characterized through a brief review of topographical maps. The color coding on USGS topographical maps provides the most effective means of simplifying the typing scheme. The suggested typing designations for the color codes found on topographical maps are as follows:
              
                Green Wooded areas (rural).
              
                White White areas generally will be treated as rural. This code applies to areas that are unwooded and do not have densely packed structures which would require the pink code (house omission tint). Parks, industrial areas, and unforested rural land will appear as white on the topographical maps. Of these categories, only the industrial areas could potentially be classified as urban based on EPA 1986 or Auer 1978. Industrial areas can be easily identified in most cases by the characteristics shown in Figure 6.0-1. For this simplified procedure, white areas that have an industrial classification will be treated as urban areas.

              Section 7.0 Statistical Methodology for Bevill Residue Determinations
              This section describes the statistical comparison of waste-derived residue to normal residue for use in determining eligibility for the Bevill exemption under 40 CFR 266.112.
              7.1 Comparison of Waste-Derived Residue to Normal Residue
              To be eligible for the Bevill exclusion from the definition of hazardous waste under 40 CFR 266.112(b)(1), waste-derived residue must not contain Appendix VIII, Part 261, constituents that could reasonably be attributable to the hazardous waste (toxic constituents) at concentrations significantly higher than in residue generated without burning or processing hazardous waste (normal residue). Concentrations of toxic constituents in normal residue are determined based on analysis of a minimum of 10 samples representing a minimum of 10 days of operation. The statistically-derived concentrations in normal residue are determined as the upper tolerance limit (95% confidence with a 95% proportion of the sample distribution) of the normal residue concentrations. The upper tolerance limit is to be determined as described in Section 7.2 below. If changes in raw materials or fuels could lower the statistically-derived concentrations of toxic constituents of concern, the statistically-derived baseline must be re-established for any such mode of operation with the new raw material or fuel.
              Concentrations of toxic constituents in waste-derived residue are determined based on the analysis of one or more samples collected over a compositing period of not more than 24 hours. Multiple samples of the waste-derived residue may be analyzed or subsamples may be composited for analysis, provided that the sampling period does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to characterize the waste-derived residue generated over a 24-hour period, the arithmetic mean of the concentrations must be used as the waste-derived concentration for each constituent.

              The concentration of a toxic constituent in the waste-derived residue is not considered to be significantly higher than in the normal residue (i.e., the residue passes the Bevill test for that constituent) if the concentration in the waste-derived residue does not exceed the statistically-derived concentration.
              7.2 Calculation of the Upper Tolerance Limit

              The 95% confidence with 95% proportion of the sample distribution (upper tolerance limit) is calculated for a set of values assuming that the values are normally distributed. The upper tolerance limit is a one-sided calculation and is an appropriate statistical test for cases in which a single value (the waste-derived residue concentration) is compared to the distribution of a range of values (the minimum of 10 measurements of normal residue concentrations). The upper tolerance limit value is determined as follows:
              
              UTL = X + (K)(S)
              
              where
              

              X = mean of the normal residue concentrations, X = X i/n,
              K = coefficient for sample size n, 95% confidence and 95% proportion,
              S = standard deviation of the normal residue concentrations,
              S = (Σ(Xi − X)2/(n − 1))0.5, and
              n = sample size.
              
              The values of K at the 95% confidence and 95% proportion, and sample size n are given in Table 7.0-1.
              For example, a normal residue test results in 10 samples with the following analytical results for toxic constituent A:
              
                
                  Sample No.

                  10
                
              

              The mean and the standard deviation of these measurements, calculated using the above equations, are 11.5 and 2.9, respectively. Assuming that the values are normally distributed, the upper tolerance limit (UTL) is given by:
              
              UTL = 11.5 + (2.911)(2.9) = 19.9 ppm
              
              Thus, if the concentration of constituent A in the waste-derived residue is below 19.9 ppm, then the waste-derived residue is eligible for the Bevill exclusion for constituent A.
              7.3 Normal Distribution Assumption

              As noted in Section 7.2 above, this statistical approach (use of the upper tolerance limit) for calculation of the concentration in normal residue is based on the assumption that the concentration data are distributed normally. The Agency is aware that concentration data of this type may not always be distributed normally, particularly when concentrations are near the detection limits. There are a number of procedures that can be used to test the distribution of a data set. For example, the Shapiro-Wilk test, examination of a histogram or plot of the data on normal probability paper, and examination of the coefficient of skewness are methods that may be applicable, depending on the nature of the data (References 1 and 2).
              
              If the concentration data are not adequately represented by a normal distribution, the data may be transformed to attain a near normal distribution. The Agency has found that concentration data, especially when near detection levels, often exhibit a lognormal distribution. The assumption of a lognormal distribution has been used in various programs at EPA, such as in the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery Land Disposal Restrictions program for determination of BDAT treatment standards. The transformed data may be tested for normality using the procedures identified above. If the transformed data are better represented by a normal distribution than the untransformed data, the transformed data should be used in determining the upper tolerance limit using the procedures in Section 7.2 above.
              In all cases where the owner or operator wishes to use other than an assumption of normally distributed data or believes that use of an alternate statistical approach is appropriate to the specific data set, he/she must provide supporting rationale in the operating record that demonstrates that the data treatment is based upon sound statistical practice.
              7.4 Nondetect Values
              The Agency is developing guidance regarding the treatment of nondetect values (data where the concentration of the constituent being measured is below the lowest concentration for which the analytical method is valid) in carrying out the statistical determination described above. Until the guidance information is available, facilities may present their own approach to the handling of nondetect data points, but must provide supporting rationale in the operating record for consideration by the Director.

              Section 8.0 Procedures for Determining Default Values for Air Pollution Control System Removal Efficiencies

              During interim status, owners or operators of boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste must submit documentation to EPA that certifies that emissions of HCl, C12, metals, and particulate matter (PM) are not likely to exceed allowable emission rates. See certification of precompliance under 40 CFR 266.103(b). This documentation also establishes interim status feed rate and operating limits for the facility. For the initial certification, estimates of emissions and system removal efficiencies (SREs) can be made to establish the operating limits. Subsequently, owners or operators must use emissions testing to demonstrate that emissions do not exceed allowable levels, and to establish operating limits. See 40 CFR 266.103(c). However, initial estimates of emissions for certification of precompliance can be based on estimated or established SREs.
              The SRE combines the effect of partitioning of the chlorine, metals, or PM and the air pollution control system removal efficiency (APCS RE) for these pollutants. The SRE is defined as:
              SRE = (species input—species emitted) / species input

              The SRE can be calculated from the partitioning factor (PF) and APCS RE by the following formula:
              
              SRE = 1—[(PF/l00) × (1—APCS RE/100)]
              
              where:
              
              PF = percentage of the pollutant partitioned to the combustion gas
              

              Estimates of the PF and/or the APCS RE can be based on either EPA's default values or engineering judgement. EPA's default values for the APCS RE for metals, HCl, Cl2, and PM are described in this section. EPA's default values for partitioning of these pollutants are described in section 9.0.
              Guidelines for the use of engineering judgement to estimate APCS REs or PFs are described in section 9.4.
              8.1 APCS RE Default Values for Metals
              EPA's default assumptions for APCS RE for metals are shown in Table 8.1-1. The default values in the table are conservative estimates of the removal efficiencies for metals in BIFs, depending on the volatility of the metal and the type of APCS.

              The volatility of a metal depends on the temperature, the thermal input, the chlorine content of the waste, and the identity and concentration of the metal. Metals that do not vaporize at combustion zone temperatures are classified as “nonvolatile”. Such metals typically enter the APCS in the form of large particles that are removed relatively easily. Metals that vaporize in the combustion zone and condense before entering the APCS are classified as “volatile”. Such metals typically enter the APCS in the form of very fine, submicron particles that are rather inefficiently removed in many APCSs. Metals that vaporize in the combustion zone and do not condense before entering the APCS are classified as “very volatile”. Such metals enter the APCS in the form of a vapor that is very inefficiently removed in many APCSs.
              Typically, BIFs have combustion zone temperatures high enough to vaporize any hazardous metal at concentrations sufficient to exceed risk-based emission limits. For this reason, the default assumption is that there are no nonvolatile metals. Tables 8.1-2 and 8.1-3 are used to determine whether metals are classified as “volatile” or “very volatile” depending on the temperature entering the APCS, the thermal input, and whether the waste is chlorinated or nonchlorinated.

                  1 Interpolation of thermal input is not allowed. If a BIF fires between two ranges, the APCS temperature under the higher thermal input must be used.
                
                  Example: For a BIF firing 10-100 MMBtu/hr, Mercury is considered very volatile at APCS temperatures above 260 F and volatile at APCS temperatures of 260 F and below.
              
              A waste is considered chlorinated if chlorine is present in concentrations greater than 0.1 percent by weight. In the EPA guidance document “Guidance for Metals and Hydrogen Chloride Controls for Hazardous Waste Incinerators, Volume IV of the Hazardous Waste Incineration Guidance Series,“(1) one percent is used for the chlorinated/nonchlorinated cutoff. However, best engineering judgement, based on examination of pilot-scale data reported by Carroll et al. (2) on the effects of waste chlorine content on metals emissions, suggests that the 1 percent cutoff may not be sufficiently conservative.
              Tables 8.1-2 and 8.1-3 were compiled based on equilibrium calculations. Metals are classified as very volatile at all temperatures above the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the metal is greater than 10 percent of the vapor pressure that results in emissions exceeding the most conservative risk-based emissions limits.
              8.2 APCS RE Default Values for HCl and Cl2
              
              Default assumptions for APCS RE for HCl in BIFs are shown in Table 8.2-1. This table is identical to the column for other BIFs except that cement kilns have a minimum HCl removal efficiency of 83 percent. Because of the alkaline nature of the raw materials in cement kilns, most of the chlorine is converted to chloride salts. Thus, the minimum APCS RE for HCl for cement kilns is independent of the APCS train.
              Removal efficiency of Cl2 for most types of APCS is generally minimal. Therefore, the default assumption for APCS RE for Cl2 for all APCSs is 0 percent. This is applicable to all BIFs, including cement kilns.
              8.3 APCS RE Default Values for Ash
              Default assumptions for APCS RE for PM are also shown in Table 8.1-4. These figures are conservative estimates of PM removal efficiencies for different types of APCSs. They are identical to the figures in the Nonvolatile APCS RE column for hazardous metals presented in Table 8.1-1 because the same collection mechanisms and collection efficiencies that apply to nonvolatile metals also apply to PM.

              Section 9.0 Procedures for Determining Default Values for Partitioning of Metals, Ash, and Total Chloride/Chlorine

              Pollutant partitioning factor estimates can come from two sources: default assumptions or engineering judgement. EPA's default assumptions are discussed below for metals, HCl, Cl2, and PM. The default assumptions are used to conservatively predict the partitioning factor for several types of BIFs. Engineering judgement-based partitioning factor estimates are discussed in section 9.4.
              9.1 Partitioning Default Value for Metals
              To be conservative, the Agency is assuming that 100 percent of each metal in each feed stream is partitioned to the combustion gas. Owners/operators may use this default value or a supportable, site-specific value developed following the general guidelines provided in section 9.4.
              9.2 Special Procedures for Chlorine, HCl, and Cl2
              

              The Agency has established the special procedures presented below for chlorine because the emission limits are based on the pollutants HCl and Cl2 formed from chlorine fed to the combustor. Therefore, the owner/operator must estimate the controlled emission rate of both HCl and Cl2 and show that they do not exceed allowable levels.
              1. The default partitioning value for the fraction of chlorine in the total feed streams that is partitioned to combustion gas is 100 percent. Owners/operators may use this default value or a supportable, site-specific value developed following the general guidelines provided in section 9.4.

              2. To determine the partitioning of chlorine in the combustion gas to HCl versus Cl2, either use the default values below or use supportable site-specific values developed following the general guidelines provided in section 9.4.

              • For BIFs excluding halogen acid furnaces (HAFs), with a total feed stream chlorine/hydrogen ratio ≤0.95, the default partitioning factor is 20 percent Cl2, 80 percent HCl.

              • For HAFs and for BIFs with a total feed stream chlorine/hydrogen ratio >0.95, the default partitioning factor is 100 percent Cl2.
              3. To determine the uncontrolled (i.e., prior to acid gas APCS) emission rate of HCl and Cl2, multiply the feed rate of chlorine times the partitioning factor for each pollutant. Then, for HCl, convert the chlorine emission rate to HCl by multiplying it by the ratio of the molecular weight of HCl to the molecular weight of Cl (i.e., 36.5/35.5). No conversion is needed for Cl2.
              9.3 Special Procedures for Ash

              This section: (1) Explains why ash feed rate limits are not applicable to cement and light-weight aggregate kilns; (2) presents the default partitioning values for ash; and (3) explains how to convert the 0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7% O2, PM emission limit to a PM emission rate.
              
                Waiver for Cement and Light-Weight Aggregate Kilns. For cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns, raw material feed streams contain the vast majority of the ash input, and a significant amount of the ash in the feed stream is entrained into the kiln exhaust gas. For these devices, the ash content of the hazardous waste stream is expected to have a negligible effect on total ash emissions. For this reason, there is no ash feed rate compliance limit for cement kilns or light-weight aggregate kilns. Nonetheless, cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns are required to initially certify that PM emissions are not likely to exceed the PM limit, and subsequently, certify through compliance testing that the PM limit is not exceeded.
              
                Default Partitioning Value for Ash. The default assumption for partitioning of ash depends on the feed stream firing system. There are two methods by which materials may be fired into BIFs: Suspension-firing and bed-firing.
              The suspension category includes atomized and lanced pumpable liquids and suspension-fired pulverized solids. The default partitioning assumption for materials fired by these systems is that 100 percent of the ash partitions to the combustion gas.
              The bed-fired category consists principally of stoker boilers and raw materials (and in some cases containerized hazardous waste) fed into cement and light-weight aggregate kilns. The default partitioning assumption for materials fired on a bed is that 5 percent of the ash partitions to the combustion gas.

The emission limit for BIFs is 0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7% 02, unless a more stringent standard applies [e.g., a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) or a State standard implemented under the State Implementation Plan (SIP)]. To convert the 0.08 gr/dscf standard to a PM mass emission rate:
              1. Determine the flue gas 02 concentration (percent by volume, dry) and flue gas flow rate (dry standard cubic feet per minute); and

              2. Calculate the allowable PM mass emission rate by multiplying the concentration- based PM emission standard times the flue gas flow rate times a dilution correction factor equal to [(21-02 concentration from step 1)/(21-7)].
              9.4 Use of Engineering Judgement To Estimate Partitioning and APCS RE Values
              Engineering judgement may be used in place of EPA's conservative default assumptions to estimate partitioning and APCS RE values provided that the engineering judgement is defensible and properly documented. To properly document engineering judgement, the owner/operator must keep a written record of all assumptions and calculations necessary to justify the APCS RE used. The owner/operator must provide this record to the Director upon request and must be prepared to defend the assumptions and calculations used.
              If the engineering judgement is based on emissions testing, the testing will often document the emission rate of a pollutant relative to the feed rate of that pollutant rather than the partitioning factor or APCS RE.
              Examples of situations where the use of engineering judgement may be supportable to estimate a partitioning factor, APCS RE, or SRE include:
              • Using emissions testing data from the facility to support an SRE, even though the testing may not meet full QA/QC procedures (e.g., triplicate test runs). The closer the test results conform with full QA/QC procedures and the closer the operating conditions during the test conform with the established operating conditions for the facility, the more supportable the engineering judgement will be.
              • Applying emissions testing data documenting an SRE for one metal, including nonhazardous surrogate metals to another less volatile metal.
              • Applying emissions testing data documenting an SRE from one facility to a similar facility.
              • Using APCS vendor guarantees of removal efficiency.
              9.5 Restrictions on Use of Test Data
              The measurement of an SRE or an APCS RE may be limited by the detection limits of the measurement technique. If the emission of a pollutant is undetectable, then the calculation of SRE or APCS RE should be based on the lower limit of detectability. An SRE or APCS RE of 100 percent is not acceptable.
              Further, mass balance data of facility inputs, emissions, and products/residues may not be used to support a partitioning factor, given the inherent uncertainties of such procedures. Partitioning factors other than the default values may be supported based on engineering judgement, considering, for example, process chemistry. Emissions test data may be used to support an engineering judgement-based SRE, which includes both partitioning and APCS RE.

              10.1 Applicability
              This method for controlling metals emissions applies to cement kilns and other industrial furnaces operating under interim status that recycle emission control residue back into the furnace.
              10.2 Introduction

              Under this method, cement kilns and other industrial furnaces that recycle emission control residue back into the furnace must comply with a kiln dust concentration limit (i.e., a collected particulate matter (PM) limit) for each metal, as well as limits on the maximum feedrates of each of the metals in: (1) pumpable hazardous waste; and (2) all hazardous waste.
              The following subsections describe how this method for controlling metals emissions is to be implemented:
              • Subsection 10.3 discusses the basis of the method and the assumptions upon which it is founded;
              • Subsection 10.4 provides an overview of the implementation of the method;
              • Subsection 10.5 is a step-by-step procedure for implementation of the method;
              • Subsection 10.6 describes the compliance procedures for this method; and
              • Appendix A describes the statistical calculations and tests to be used in the method.
              10.3 Basis
              The viability of this method depends on three fundamental assumptions:
              (1) Variations in the ratio of the metal concentration in the emitted particulate to the metal concentration in the collected kiln dust (referred to as the enrichment factor or EF) for any given metal at any given facility will fall within a normal distribution that can be experimentally determined.
              (2) The metal concentrations in the collected kiln dust can be accurately and representatively measured.
              (3) The facility will remain in compliance with the applicable particulate matter (PM) emission standard.
              Given these assumptions. metal emissions can be related to the measured concentrations in the collected kiln dust by the following equation:
              
                
                EC06NO91.014
              
              Where:
              
              ME is the metal emitted;
              PME is the particulate matter emitted;
              DMC is the metal concentration in the collected kiln dust; and
              EF is the enrichment factor, which is the ratio of the metal concentration in the emitted particulate matter to the metal concentration in the collected kiln dust.
              
              This equation can be rearranged to calculate a maximum allowable dust metal concentration limit (DMCL) by assuming worst-case conditions that: metal emissions are at the Tier III (or Tier II) limit (see 40 CFR 266.106), and that particulate emissions are at the particulate matter limit (PML):
              
                EC06NO91.015
              

              The enrichment factor used in the above equation must be determined experimentally from a minimum of 10 tests in which metal concentrations are measured in kiln dust and stack samples taken simultaneously. This approach provides a range of enrichment factors that can be inserted into a statistical distribution (t-distribution) to determine EF95
                % and EF99
                %. EF95
                % is the value at which there is a 95% confidence level that the enrichment factor is below this value at any given time. Similarly, EF99
                % is the value at which there is a 99% confidence level that the enrichment factor is below this value at any given time. EF95
                % is used to calculate the “violation” dust metal concentration limit (DMCLv):
              
                EC06NO91.016
              
              If the kiln dust metal concentration is just above this “violation” limit, and the PM emissions are at the PM emissions limit, there is a 5% chance that the metal emissions are above the Tier III limit. In such a case, the facility would be in violation of the metals standard.

              To provide a margin of safety, a second, more conservative kiln dust metal concentration limit is also used. This “conservative” dust metal concentration limit (DMCLc) is calculated using a “safe” enrichment factor (SEF). If EF99
                % is greater than two times the value of EF95
                %, the “safe” enrichment factor can be calculated using Equation 4a:
              
              SEF≥2 EF95
                %    (4a)
              
              
              If EF99
                % is not greater than two times the value of EF95
                %, the “safe” enrichment factor can be calculated using Equation 4b:
              
              SEF≥EF99
                %    (4b)
              

              In cases where the enrichment factor cannot be determined because the kiln dust metal concentration is nondetectable, the “safe” enrichment factor is as follows:
              
              SEF = 100    (4c)
              
              For all cases, the “conservative” dust metal concentration limit is calculated using the following equation:
              
                EC06NO91.017
              
              If the kiln dust metal concentration at a facility is just above the “conservative” limit based on that “safe” enrichment factor provided in Equation 4a, and the PM emissions are at the PM emissions limit, there is a 5% chance that the metal emissions are above one-half the Tier III limit. If the kiln dust metal concentration at the facility is just above the “conservative” limit based on the “safe” enrichment factor provided in Equation 4b, and the PM emissions are at the PM emissions limit, there is a 1% chance that the metal emissions are above the Tier III limit. In either case, the facility would be unacceptably close to a violation. If this situation occurs more than 5% of the time, the facility would be required to rerun the series of 10 tests to determine the enrichment factor. To avoid this expense, the facility would be advised to reduce its metals feedrates or to take other appropriate measures to maintain its kiln dust metal concentrations in compliance with the “conservative” dust metal concentration limits.

              In cases where the enrichment factor cannot be determined because the kiln dust metal concentration is nondetectable, and thus no EF95
                % exists, the “violation” dust metal concentration limit is set at ten times the “conservative” limit:
              
              DMCLv = 10 × DMCLc    (6)
              
              10.4 Overview
              The flowchart for implementing the method is shown in Figure 10.4-1. The general procedure is as follows:
              • Follow the certification of precompliance procedures described in subsection 10.6 (to comply with 40 CFR 266.103(b)).
              • For each metal of concern, perform a series of tests to establish the relationship (enrichment factor) between the concentration of emitted metal and the metal concentration in the collected kiln dust.
              • Use the demonstrated enrichment factor, in combination with the Tier III (or Tier II) metal emission limit and the most stringent applicable particulate emission limit, to calculate the “violation” and “conservative” dust metal concentration limits. Include this information with the certification of compliance under 40 CFR 266.103(c).
              
                
                EC01AU92.042
              
              • Perform daily and/or weekly monitoring of the cement kiln dust metal concentration to ensure (with appropriate QA/QC) that the metal concentration does not exceed either limit.

              —If the cement kiln dust metal concentration exceeds the “conservative” limit more than 5% of the time (i.e., more than three failures in last 60 tests), the series of tests to determine the enrichment factor must be repeated.
              —If the cement kiln dust metal concentration exceeds the “violation” limit, a violation has occurred.
              

              • Perform quarterly tests to verify that the enrichment factor has not increased significantly. If the enrichment factor has increased, the series of tests to determine the enrichment factor must be repeated.
              
              10.5 Implementation Procedures
              A step-by-step description for implementing the method is provided below:
              (1) Prepare initial limits and test plans.
              • Determine the Tier III metal emission limit. The Tier II metal emission limit may also be used (see 40 CFR 266.106).

              • Determine the applicable PM emission standard. This standard is the most stringent particulate emission standard that applies to the facility. A facility may elect to restrict itself to an even more stringent self-imposed PM emission standard, particularly if the facility finds that it is easier to control particulate emissions than to reduce the kiln dust concentration of a certain metal (i.e., lead).
              • Determine which metals need to be monitored (i.e., all hazardous metals for which Tier III emission limits are lower than PM emission limits—assuming PM is pure metal).
              • Follow the compliance procedures described in Subsection 10.6.
              • Follow appropriate guidelines for preparing test plans and waste analysis plans for the following tests:
              —Compliance tests to determine limits on metal feedrates in pumpable hazardous wastes and in all hazardous wastes (as well as to determine other compliance parameters);
              —Initial tests to determine enrichment factors;
              —Quarterly tests to verify enrichment factors;
              —Analysis of hazardous waste feedstreams; and
              —Daily and/or weekly monitoring of kiln dust for continuing compliance.
              
              (2) Conduct tests to determine the enrichment factor.
              • These tests must be conducted within a 14-day period. No more than two tests may be conducted in any single day. If the tests are not completed within a 14-day period, they must be repeated.
              • Simultaneous stack samples and kiln dust samples must be taken.
              —Stack sampling must be conducted with the multiple metals train according to procedures provided in section 10.3 of this Methods Manual.
              —Kiln dust sampling must be conducted as follows:
              —Follow appropriate sampling and analytical procedures such as those described in the waste analysis plan as they pertain to the condition and accessibility of the dust.
              —Samples should be representative of the last ESP or Fabric Filter in the APCS ­series.
              
              • The feedrates of hazardous metals in all pumpable hazardous waste streams and in all hazardous waste streams must be monitored during these tests. It is recommended (but not required) that the feedrates of hazardous metals in all feedstreams also be monitored.
              • At least ten single (noncomposited) runs are required during the tests.
              —The facility must follow a normal schedule of kiln dust recharging for all of the tests.
              —Three of the first five tests must be compliance tests in conformance with 40 CFR 266.103(c); i.e., they must be used to determine maximum allowable feedrates of metals in pumpable hazardous wastes, and in all hazardous wastes, as well as to determine other compliance limits (see 40 CFR 266.103(c)(1)).
              —The remainder of the tests need not be conducted under full compliance test conditions; however, the facility must operate at its compliance test production rate, and it must burn hazardous waste during these tests such that the feedrate of each metal for pumpable and total hazardous wastes is at least 25% of the feedrate during compliance testing. If these criteria, and those discussed below, are not met for any parameter during a test, then either the test is not valid for determining enrichment factors under this method, or the compliance limits for that parameter must be established based on these test conditions rather than on the compliance test conditions.
              
              • Verify that compliance emission limits are not exceeded.
              —Metal emissions must not exceed Tier III (or Tier II) limits.
              —PM emissions must not exceed the most stringent of applicable PM standards (or an optional self-imposed particulate standard).
              • The facility must generate normal, marketable product using normal raw materials and fuels under normal operating conditions (for parameters other than those specified under this method) when these tests are ­conducted.
              • Chromium must be treated as a special case:

              —The enrichment factor for total chromium is calculated in the same way as the enrichment factor for other metals (i.e., the enrichment factor is the ratio of the concentration of total chromium in the emitted particulate matter to the concentration of total chromium in the collected kiln dust).
              —The enrichment factor for hexavalent chromium (if measured) is defined as the ratio of the concentration of hexavalent chromium in the emitted particulate matter to the concentration of total chromium in the collected kiln dust.
              

              (3) Use the enrichment factors measured in Step 2 to determine EF95
                %, EF99
                %, and SEF.
              • Calculate EF95
                % and EF99
                % according to the t-distribution as described in Appendix A
              • Calculate SEF by
              
              —Equation 4a if EF95
                % is determinable and if EF99
                % is greater than two times EF95
                % ,
              —Equation 4b if EF95
                % is determinable and if EF99
                % is not greater than two times EF95
                %,
              —Equation 4c if EF95
                % is not determinable.
              
              The facility may choose to set an even more conservative SEF to give itself a larger margin of safety between the point where corrective action is necessary and the point where a violation occurs.
              (4) Prepare certification of compliance.

              • Calculate the “conservative” dust metal concentration limit (DMCLc) using Equation 5.
              —Chromium is treated as a special case. The “conservative” kiln dust chromium concentration limit is set for total chromium, not for hexavalent chromium. The limit for total chromium must be calculated using the Tier III (or Tier II) metal limit for hexavalent chromium.
              —If the stack samples described in Step 2 were analyzed for hexavalent chromium, the SEF based on the hexavalent chromium enrichment factors (as defined in Step 2) must be used in this calculation.
              —If the stack samples were not analyzed for hexavalent chromium, then the SEF based on the total chromium enrichment factor must be used in this calculation.
              

              • Calculate the “violation” dust metal concentration limit (DMCLv) using Equation 3 if EF95
                % is determinable, or using Equation 6 if EF95
                % is not determinable.
              —Chromium is treated as a special case. The “violation” kiln dust chromium concentration limit is set for total chromium, not for hexavalent chromium. The limit for total chromium must be calculated using the Tier III (or Tier II) metal limit for hexavalent chromium.

              —If the stack samples taken in Step 2 were analyzed for hexavalent chromium, the EF95
                % based on the hexavalent chromium enrichment factor (as defined in Step 2) should be used in this calculation.

              —If the stack samples were not analyzed for hexavalent chromium, the EF95
                % based on the total chromium enrichment factor must be used in this calculation.
              
              • Submit certification of compliance.
              • Steps 2-4 must be repeated for recertification, which is required once every 3 years (see § 266.103(d)).
              (5) Monitor metal concentrations in kiln dust for continuing compliance, and maintain compliance with all compliance limits for the duration of interim status.
              • Metals to be monitored during compliance testing are classified as either “critical” or “noncritical” metals.
              —All metals must initially be classified as “critical” metals and be monitored on a daily basis.
              —A “critical” metal may be reclassified as a “noncritical” metal if its concentration in the kiln dust remains below 10% of its “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit for 30 consecutive daily samples. “Noncritical” metals must be monitored on a weekly basis.
              —A “noncritical” metal must be reclassified as a “critical” metal if its concentration in the kiln dust is above 10% of its “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit for any single daily or weekly ­sample.
              
              • Noncompliance with the sampling and analysis schedule prescribed by this method is a violation of the metals controls under § 266.103.
              • Follow the sampling, compositing, and analytical procedures described in this method and in other appropriate methods, as they pertain to the condition and accessibility of the kiln dust.
              • Follow the same procedures and sample at the same locations as were used for kiln dust samples collected to determine the enrichment factors (as discussed in Step 2).
              • Samples must be collected at least once every 8 hours, and a daily composite must be prepared according to appropriate procedures.
              —At least one composite sample is required. This sample is referred to as the “required” sample.
              —For QA/QC purposes, a facility may elect to collect two or more additional samples. These samples are referred to as the “spare” samples. These additional samples must be collected over the same time period and according to the same procedures as those used for the “required” sample.
              —Samples for “critical” metals must be daily composites.
              —Samples for “noncritical” metals must be weekly composites. These samples can be composites of the original 8-hour samples, or they can be composites of daily composite samples.
              • Analyze the “required” sample to determine the concentration of each metal.
              —This analysis must be completed within 48 hours of the close of the sampling period. Failure to meet this schedule is a violation of the metals standards of § 266.103.
              
              • If the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit is exceeded for any metal, refer to Step 8.
              • If the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit is not exceeded, continue with the daily or weekly monitoring (Step 5) for the duration of interim status.
              • Conduct quarterly enrichment factor verification tests, as described in Step 6.
              (6) Conduct quarterly enrichment factor verification tests.

              • After certification of compliance with the metals standards, a facility must conduct quarterly enrichment factor verification tests every three months for the duration of interim status. The first quarterly test must be completed within three months of certification (or recertification). Each subsequent quarterly test must be completed within three months of the preceding quarterly test. Failure to meet this schedule is a violation.
              • Simultaneous stack samples and kiln dust samples must be collected.
              • Follow the same procedures and sample at the same locations as were used for kiln dust samples and stack samples collected to determine the enrichment factors (as discussed in Step 2).
              • At least three single (noncomposited) runs are required. These tests need not be conducted under the operating conditions of the initial compliance test; however, the facility must operate under the following conditions:
              —It must operate at compliance test production rate.
              —It must burn hazardous waste during the test, and for the 2-day period immediately preceding the test, such that the feedrate of each metal for pumpable and total hazardous wastes consist of at least 25% of the operating limits established during the compliance test.
              —It must remain in compliance with all compliance parameters (see § 266.103(c)(1)).
              —It must follow a normal schedule of kiln dust recharging.
              —It must generate normal marketable product from normal raw materials during the tests.
              
              (7) Conduct a statistical test to determine if the enrichment factors measured in the quarterly verification tests have increased significantly from the enrichment factors determined in the tests conducted in Step 2. The enrichment factors have increased significantly if all three of the following criteria are met:
              • By applying the t-test described in appendix A, it is determined that the enrichment factors measured in the quarterly tests are not taken from the same population as the enrichment factors measured in the Step 2 tests;
              • The EF95
                % calculated for the combined data sets (i.e., the quarterly test data and the original Step 2 test data) according to the t-distribution (described in appendix A) is more than 10% higher than the EF95
                % based on the enrichment factors previously measured in Step 2; and

              • The highest measured kiln dust metal concentration recorded in the previous quarter is more than 10% of the “violation” kiln dust concentration limit that would be calculated from the combined EF95
                %.
              If the enrichment factors have increased significantly, the tests to determine the enrichment factors must be repeated (refer to Step 11). If the enrichment factors have not increased significantly, continue to use the kiln dust metal concentration limits based on the enrichment factors previously measured in Step 2, and continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring described in Step 5.
              (8) If the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit was exceeded for any metal in any single analysis of the “required” kiln dust sample, the “spare” samples corresponding to the same period may be analyzed to determine if the exceedance was due to a sampling or analysis error.
              • If no “spare” samples were taken, refer to Step 9.
              • If the average of all the samples for a given day (or week, as applicable) (including the “required” sample and the “spare” samples) does not exceed the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit, no corrective measures are necessary; continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring as described in Step 5.
              • If the average of all the samples for a given day (or week, as applicable) exceeds the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit, but the average of the “spare” samples is below the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit, apply the Q-test, described in appendix A, to determine whether the “required” sample concentration can be judged as an outlier.
              —If the “required” sample concentration is judged an outlier, no corrective measures are necessary; continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring described in Step 5.
              —If the “required” sample concentration is not judged an outlier, refer to Step 9.
              
              (9) Determine if the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration has been exceeded based on either the average of all the samples collected during the 24-hour period in question, or if discarding an outlier can be statistically justified by the Q-test described in appendix A, on the average of the remaining samples.
              • If the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration limit has been exceeded, a violation of the metals controls under § 266.103(c) has occurred. Notify the Director that a violation has occurred. Hazardous waste may be burned for testing purposes for up to 720 operating hours to support a revised certification of compliance. Note that the Director may grant an extension of the hours of hazardous waste burning under § 266.103(c)(7) if additional burning time is needed to support a revised certification for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operator. Until a revised certification of compliance is submitted to the Director, the feedrate of the metals in violation in total and pumpable hazardous waste feeds is limited to 50% of the previous compliance test limits.
              • If the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration has not been exceeded:

              —If the exceedance occurred in a daily composite sample, refer to Step 10.
              
              —If the exceedance occurred in a weekly composite sample, refer to Step 11.
              
              (10) Determine if the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit has been exceeded more than three times in the last 60 days.
              • If not, log this exceedance and continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring (Step 5).
              • If so, the tests to determine the enrichment factors must be repeated (refer to Step 11).
              • This determination is made separately for each metal. For example,
              —Three exceedances for each of the ten hazardous metals are allowed within any 60-day period.
              —Four exceedances of any single metal in any 60-day period is not allowed.
              
              • This determination should be made daily, beginning on the first day of daily monitoring. For example, if four exceedances of any single metal occur in the first four days of daily monitoring, do not wait until the end of the 60-day period; refer immediately to Step 11.
              (11) The tests to determine the enrichment factor must be repeated if: (1) More than three exceedances of the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit occur within any 60 consecutive daily samples; (2) an excursion of the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit occurs in any weekly sample; or (3) a quarterly test indicates that the enrichment factors have increased significantly.
              • The facility must notify the Director if these tests must be repeated.
              • The facility has up to 720 hazardous-waste-burning hours to redetermine the enrichment factors for the metal or metals in question and to recertify (beginning with a return to Step 2). During this period, the facility must reduce the feed rate of the metal in violation by 50%. If the facility has not completed the recertification process within this period, it must stop burning or obtain an extension. Hazardous waste burning may resume only when the recertification process (ending with Step 4) has been completed.
              • Meanwhile, the facility must continue with daily kiln dust metals monitoring (Step 5) and must remain in compliance with the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration limits (Step 9).
              10.6 Precompliance Procedures
              Cement kilns and other industrial furnaces that recycle emission control residue back into the furnace must comply with the same certification schedules and procedures (with the few exceptions described below) that apply to other boilers and industrial furnaces. These schedules and procedures, as set forth in § 266.103, require no later than the effective date of the rule, each facility submit a certification which establishes precompliance limits for a number of compliance parameters (see § 266.103(b)(3)), and that each facility immediately begin to operate under these limits.

              These precompliance limits must ensure that interim status emissions limits for hazardous metals, particulate matter, HCl, and Cl2 are not likely to be exceeded. Determination of the values of the precompliance limits must be made based on either (1) conservative default assumptions provided in this Methods Manual, or (2) engineering judgement.
              The flowchart for implementing the precompliance procedures is shown in Figure 10.6-1. The step-by-step precompliance implementation procedure is described below. The precompliance implementation procedures and numbering scheme are similar to those used for the compliance procedures described in Subsection 10.5.
              (1) Prepare initial limits and test plans.
              • Determine the Tier III metal emission limit. The Tier II metal emission limit may also be used (see 40 CFR 266.106).

              • Determine the applicable PM emission standard. This standard is the most stringent particulate emission standard that applies to the facility. A facility may elect to restrict itself to an even more stringent self-imposed PM emission standard, particularly if the facility finds that it is easier to control particulate emissions than to reduce the kiln dust concentration of a certain metal (i.e., lead).
              • Determine which metals need to be monitored (i.e., all hazardous metals for which Tier III emission limits are lower than PM emission limits, assuming PM is pure metal).
              • Follow appropriate procedures for preparing waste analysis plans for the following tasks:
              —Analysis of hazardous waste feedstreams.
              —Daily and/or weekly monitoring of kiln dust concentrations for continuing compliance.
              
              (2) Determine the “safe” enrichment factor for precompliance. In this context, the “safe” enrichment factor is a conservatively high estimate of the enrichment factor (the ratio of the emitted metal concentration to the metal concentration in the collected kiln dust). The “safe” enrichment factor must be calculated from either conservative default values, or engineering judgement.
              
                
                EC01AU92.043
              
              • Conservative default values for the “safe” enrichment factor are as follows:
              —SEF = 10 for all hazardous metals except mercury. SEF = 10 for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, silver, and thallium.
              —SEF = 100 for mercury.
              
              • Engineering judgement may be used in place of conservative default assumptions provided that the engineering judgement is defensible and properly documented. The facility must keep a written record of all assumptions and calculations necessary to justify the SEF. The facility must provide this record to EPA upon request and must be prepared to defend these assumptions and calculations.
              Examples of situations where the use of engineering judgement is appropriate include:
              —Use of data from precompliance tests;
              —Use of data from previous compliance tests; and
              —Use of data from similar facilities.
              
              (3) This step does not apply to precompliance procedures.
              (4) Prepare certification of precompliance.
              

              • Calculate the “conservative” dust metal concentration limit (DMCLc) using Equation 5.

              • Submit certification of precompliance. This certification must include precompliance limits for all compliance parameters that apply to other boilers and industrial furnaces (i.e., those that do not recycle emission control residue back into the furnace) as listed in § 266.103(b)(3), except that it is not necessary to set precompliance limits on maximum feedrate of each hazardous metal in all combined feedstreams.
              • Furnaces that recycle collected PM back into the furnace (and that elect to comply with this method (see § 266.103(c)(3)(ii)) are subject to a special precompliance parameter, however. They must establish precompliance limits on the maximum concentration of each hazardous metal in collected kiln dust (which must be set according to the procedures described above).
              (5) Monitor metal concentration in kiln dust for continuing compliance, and maintain compliance with all precompliance limits until certification of compliance has been submitted.
              • Metals to be monitored during precompliance testing are classified as either “critical” or “noncritical” metals.
              —All metals must initially be classified as “critical” metals and be monitored on a daily basis.
              —A “critical” metal may be reclassified as a “noncritical” metal if its concentration in the kiln dust remains below 10% of its “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit for 30 consecutive daily samples. “Noncritical” metals must be monitored on a weekly basis, at a minimum.
              —A “noncritical” metal must be reclassified as a “critical” metal if its concentration in the kiln dust is above 10% of its “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit for any single daily or weekly ­sample.
              
              • It is a violation if the facility fails to analyze the kiln dust for any “critical” metal on any single day or for any “noncritical” metal during any single week, when hazardous waste is burned.
              • Follow the sampling, compositing, and analytical procedures described in this method and in other appropriate methods as they pertain to the condition and accessibility of the kiln dust.
              • Samples must be collected at least once every 8 hours, and a daily composite must be prepared according to appropriate procedures.
              —At least one composite sample is required. This sample is referred to as the “required” sample.
              —For QA/QC purposes, a facility may elect to collect two or more additional samples. These samples are referred to as the “spare” samples. These additional samples must be collected over the same time period and according to the same procedures as those used for the “required” sample.
              —Samples for “critical” metals must be daily composites.
              —Samples for “noncritical” metals must be weekly composites, at a minimum. These samples can be composites of the original 8-hour samples, or they can be composites of daily composite samples.
              
              • Analyze the “required” sample to determine the concentration of each metal.
              —This analysis must be completed within 48 hours of the close of the sampling period. Failure to meet this schedule is a violation.
              
              • If the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit is exceeded for any metal, refer to Step 8.
              • If the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit is not exceeded, continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring (Step 5) for the duration of interim status.
              (6) This step does not apply to precompliance procedures.
              (7) This step does not apply to precompliance procedures.
              (8) If the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit was exceeded for any metal in any single analysis of the “required” kiln dust sample, the “spare” samples corresponding to the same period may be analyzed to determine if the exceedance is due to a sampling or analysis error.
              • If no “spare” samples were taken, refer to Step 9.
              • If the average of all the samples for a given day (or week, as applicable) (including the “required” sample and the “spare” samples) does not exceed the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit, no corrective measures are necessary; continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring as described in Step 5.
              • If the average of all the samples for a given day (or week, as applicable) exceeds the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit, but the average of the “spare” samples is below the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit, apply the Q-test, described in appendix A, to determine whether the “required” sample concentration can be judged as an outlier.
              —If the “required” sample concentration is judged an outlier, no corrective measures are necessary; continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring described in Step 5.
              —If the “required” sample concentration is not judged an outlier, refer to Step 10.
              
              (9) This step does not apply to precompliance procedures.

              (10) Determine if the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit has been exceeded more than three times in the last 60 days.
              
              • If not, log this exceedance and continue with the daily and/or weekly monitoring (Step 5).
              • If so, the tests to determine the enrichment factors must be repeated (refer to Step 11).
              • This determination is made separately for each metal; for example:
              —Three exceedances for each of the ten hazardous metals are allowed within any 60-day period.
              —Four exceedances of any single metal in any 60-day period is not allowed.
              
              • This determination should be made daily, beginning on the first day of daily monitoring. For example, if four exceedances of any single metal occur in the first four days of daily monitoring, do not wait until the end of the 60-day period; refer immediately to Step 11.
              (11) A revised certification of precompliance must be submitted to the Director (or certification of compliance must be submitted) if: (1) More than three exceedances of the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit occur within any 60 consecutive daily samples; or (2) an exceedance of the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit occurs in any weekly sample.
              • The facility must notify the Director if a revised certification of precompliance must be submitted.
              • The facility has up to 720 waste-burning hours to submit a certification of compliance or a revised certification of precompliance. During this period, the feed rate of the metal in violation must be reduced by 50%. In the case of a revised certification of precompliance, engineering judgement must be used to ensure that the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration will not be exceeded. Examples of how this goal might be accomplished include:
              —Changing equipment or operating procedures to reduce the kiln dust metal concentration;
              —Changing equipment or operating procedures, or using more detailed engineering judgement, to decrease the estimated SEF and thus increase the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit;
              —Increasing the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit by imposing a stricter PM emissions standard; or
              —Increasing the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit by performing a more detailed risk assessment to increase the metal emission limits.
              
              • Meanwhile, the facility must continue with daily kiln dust metals monitoring (Step 5).
              Appendix A to Appendix IX to Part 266—Statistics
              A.1 Determination of Enrichment Factor

              After at least 10 initial emissions tests are performed, an enrichment factor for each metal must be determined. At the 95% confidence level, the enrichment factor, EF95
                %, is based on the test results and is statistically determined so there is only a 5% chance that the enrichment factor at any given time will be larger than EF95
                %. Similarly, at the 99% confidence level, the enrichment factor, EF99
                %, is statistically determined so there is only a 1% chance that the enrichment factor at any given time will be larger than EF99
                %.
              For a large number of samples (n >30), EF95
                % is based on a normal distribution, and is equal to:
              
              
                EF
                95
                %=EF + z
                c σ    (1)
              
              where:
              
                EC06NO91.018
              
              
                EC06NO91.019
              
              For a 95% confidence level, zc is equal to 1.645.
              For a small number of samples (n<30), EF95
                % is based on the t-distribution and is equal to:
              
              
                EF
                95
                %=EF + t
                c
                S    (4)
              
              
              where the standard deviation, S, is defined as:
              
                EC06NO91.020
              
              tc is a function of the number of samples and the confidence level that is desired. It increases in value as the sample size decreases and the confidence level increases. The 95% confidence level is used in this method to calculate the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration limit; and the 99% confidence level is sometimes used to calculate the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit. Values of tc are shown in table A-1 for various degrees of freedom (degrees of freedom = sample size−1) at the 95% and 99% confidence levels. As the sample size approaches infinity, the normal distribution is approached.
              A.2 Comparison of Enrichment Factor Groups

              To determine if the enrichment factors measured in the quarterly tests are significantly different from the enrichment factors determined in the initial Step 2 tests, the t-test is used. In this test, the value tmeas:

              is compared to tcrit at the desired confidence level. The 95% confidence level is used in this method. Values of tcrit are shown in table A-1 for various degrees of freedom (degrees of freedom n1 + n2−2) at the 95% and 99% confidence levels. If tmeas is greater than tcrit, it can be concluded with 95% confidence that the two groups are not from the same population.
              A.3 Rejection of Data
              If the concentration of any hazardous metal in the “required” kiln dust sample exceeds the kiln dust metal concentration limit, the “spare” samples are analyzed. If the average of the combined “required” and “spare” values is still above the limit, a statistical test is used to decide if the upper value can be rejected.

              The “Q-test” is used to determine if a data point can be rejected. The difference between the questionable result and its neighbor is divided by the spread of the entire data set. The resulting ratio, Qmeas, is then compared with rejection values that are critical for a particular degree of confidence, where Qmeas is:
              
                EC06NO91.023
              

              The 90% confidence level for data rejection is used in this method. Table A-2 provides the values of Qcrit at the 90% confidence level. If Qmeas is larger than Qcrit, the data point can be discarded. Only one data point from a sample group can be rejected using this method.

At a minimum, the analysis must contain all the information needed to treat or store the waste to comply with this part and 40 CFR part 268.
              (1) You may include data in the analysis that was developed under 40 CFR part 261, and published or documented data on the hazardous waste or on hazardous waste generated from similar processes.
              (2) You must repeat the analysis as necessary to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. At a minimum, you must repeat the analysis if the process or operation generating the hazardous wastes has changed.
              (b) You must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan that describes the procedures you will follow to comply with paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep this plan at the facility. If you receive wastes generated from off-site, and are eligible for a standardized permit, you also must have submitted the waste analysis plan with the Notice of Intent. At a minimum, the plan must specify all of the following:
              (1) The hazardous waste parameters that you will analyze and the rationale for selecting these parameters (that is, how analysis for these parameters will provide sufficient information on the waste's properties to comply with paragraph (a) of this section).
              (2) The test methods you will use to test for these parameters.
              (3) The sampling method you will use to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be analyzed. You may obtain a representative sample using either:
              (i) One of the sampling methods described in appendix I of 40 CFR part 261; or
              (ii) An equivalent sampling method.
              (4) How frequently you will review or repeat the initial analysis of the waste to ensure that the analysis is accurate and up to date.
              (5) Where applicable, the methods you will use to meet the additional waste analysis requirements for specific waste management methods as specified in 40 CFR 264.17, 264.1034(d), 264.1063(d), and 264.1083.
            
            
              § 267.14
              What are my security requirements?
              (a) You must prevent, and minimize the possibility for, livestock and unauthorized people from entering the active portion of your facility.
              (b) Your facility must have:
              (1) A 24-hour surveillance system (for example, television monitoring or surveillance by guards or facility personnel) that continuously monitors and controls entry onto the active portion of the facility; or
              (2) An artificial or natural barrier (for example, a fence in good repair or a fence combined with a cliff) that completely surrounds the active portion of the facility; and
              (3) A means to control entry, at all times, through the gates or other entrances to the active portion of the facility (for example, an attendant, television monitors, locked entrance, or controlled roadway access to the facility).

              (c) You must post a sign at each entrance to the active portion of a facility, and at other prominent locations, in sufficient numbers to be seen from any approach to this active portion. The sign must bear the legend “Danger—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out.” The legend must be in English and in any other language predominant in the area surrounding the facility (for example, facilities in counties bordering the Canadian province of Quebec must post signs in French, and facilities in counties bordering Mexico must post signs in Spanish), and must be legible from a distance of at least 25 feet. You may use existing signs with a legend other than “Danger—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out” if the legend on the sign indicates that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the active portion, and that entry onto the active portion can be dangerous.
            
            
              § 267.15

              (4) Arrangements to familiarize local hospitals with the properties of hazardous waste handled at the facility and the types of injuries or illnesses that could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the facility.
              (b) If State or local authorities decline to enter into such arrangements, you must document the refusal in the operating record.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures
            
              § 267.50
              Does this subpart apply to me?
              This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility that treats or stores hazardous waste under a 40 CFR part 270, subpart J standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b).
            
            
              § 267.51
              What is the purpose of the contingency plan and how do I use it?
              (a) You must have a contingency plan for your facility. You must design the plan to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water.
              (b) You must implement the provisions of the plan immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human health or the environment.
            
            
              § 267.52
              What must be in the contingency plan?
              (a) Your contingency plan must:
              (1) Describe the actions facility personnel will take to comply with §§ 267.51 and 267.56 in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.
              (2) Describe all arrangements agreed upon under § 267.36 by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and state and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services.
              (3) List names, addresses, and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see § 267.55), and you must keep the list up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates.

              (4) Include a current list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. In addition, you must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.
              (5) Include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. You must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).
              (b) If you have already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan under 40 CFR part 112, or some other emergency or contingency plan, you need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that will comply with the requirements of this part.
            
            
              § 267.53
              Who must have copies of the contingency plan?
              (a) You must maintain a copy of the plan with all revisions at the facility; and
              (b) You must submit a copy with all revisions to all local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and state and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services.
            
            
              § 267.54
              When must I amend the contingency plan?
              You must review, and immediately amend the contingency plan, if necessary, whenever:
              (a) The facility permit is revised.
              (b) The plan fails in an emergency.
              (c) You change the facility (in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances) in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency.
              (d) You change the list of emergency coordinators.
              (e) You change the list of emergency equipment.
            
            
              § 267.55
              What is the role of the emergency coordinator?
              At least one employee must be either on the facility premises or on call at all times (that is, available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) who has the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan.
            
            
              § 267.56
              What are the required emergency procedures for the emergency coordinator?
              (a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:
              (1) Activate internal facility alarm or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel, and
              (2) Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.
              (b) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must:
              (1) Immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.

              (2) Assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion. For example, the assessment would consider the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions.
              
              (c) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as follows:
              (1) If his assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and
              (2) He must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll-free number 800/ 424-8802). The report must include:
              (i) Name and telephone number of the reporter.
              (ii) Name and address of facility.
              (iii) Time and type of incident (for example, a release or a fire).
              (iv) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known.
              (v) The extent of injuries, if any.
              (vi) The possible hazards to human health or the environment outside the facility.
              (d) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing release waste, and removing or isolating containers.
              (e) If the facility stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, when appropriate.
            
            
              § 267.57
              What must the emergency coordinator do after an emergency?
              (a) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.
              (b) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:
              (1) No waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed.
              (2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.
            
            
              § 267.58
              What notification and recordkeeping must I do after an emergency?
              (a) You must notify the Regional Administrator, and appropriate State and local authorities, that the facility is in compliance with § 267.57(b) before operations are resumed in the affected area(s) of the facility.
              (b) You must note the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan in the operating record. Within 15 days after the incident, you must submit a written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. You must include the following in the report:
              (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator.
              (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the facility.
              (3) The date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion).
              (4) The name and quantity of material(s) involved.
              (5) The extent of injuries, if any.
              (6) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable.
              (7) The estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Notifying
            
              § 267.70
              Does this subpart apply to me?
              This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility that stores or non-thermally treats a hazardous waste under a 40 CFR part 270, subpart J standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b). In addition, you must comply with the manifest requirements of 40 CFR part 262 whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from your facility.
            
            
              
              § 267.71
              Use of the manifest system.
              (a) If a facility receives hazardous waste accompanied by a manifest, the owner or operator, or his agent, must:
              (1) Sign and date each copy of the manifest to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest was received;
              (2) Note any significant discrepancies in the manifest (as defined in § 267.72(a)) on each copy of the manifest;
              (3) Immediately give the transporter at least one copy of the signed manifest;
              (4) Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the manifest to the generator;
              (5) Retain at the facility a copy of each manifest for at least three years from the date of delivery; and
              (6) If a facility receives hazardous waste subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H from a foreign source, the receiving facility must:
              (i) Additionally list the relevant consent number from consent documentation supplied by EPA to the facility for each waste listed on the manifest, matched to the relevant list number for the waste from block 9b. If additional space is needed, the receiving facility should use a Continuation Sheet(s) (EPA Form 8700-22A); and
              (ii) Mail a copy of the manifest to EPA using the addresses listed in 40 CFR 262.82(e) within thirty (30) days of delivery until the facility can submit such a copy to the e-Manifest system per 40 CFR 264.71(a)(2)(v) or 265.71(a)(2)(v).
              (b) If a facility receives, from a rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter, hazardous waste which is accompanied by a shipping paper containing all the information required on the manifest (excluding the EPA identification numbers, generator's certification, and signatures), the owner or operator, or his agent, must:
              (1) Sign and date each copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest or shipping paper was received;
              (2) Note any significant discrepancies (as defined in § 267.72(a)) in the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) on each copy of the manifest or shipping paper. Note that the Agency does not intend that the owner or operator of a facility whose procedures under § 267.13(c) include waste analysis must perform that analysis before signing the shipping paper and giving it to the transporter. Section 267.72(b), however, requires reporting an unreconciled discrepancy discovered during later analysis.
              (3) Immediately give the rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter at least one copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received);
              (4) Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the signed and dated manifest to the generator; however, if the manifest has not been received within 30 days after delivery, the owner or operator, or his agent, must send a copy of the shipping paper signed and dated to the generator. Note that § 262.23(c) of this chapter requires the generator to send three copies of the manifest to the facility when hazardous waste is sent by rail or water (bulk shipment); and
              (5) Retain at the facility a copy of the manifest and shipping paper (if signed in lieu of the manifest at the time of delivery) for at least three years from the date of delivery.
              (c) Whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from a facility, the owner or operator of that facility must comply with the requirements of part 262 of this chapter. The Agency notes that the provisions of § 262.16 or 262.17 are applicable to the on-site accumulation of hazardous wastes by generators. Therefore, the provisions of § 262.16 or 262.17 only apply to owners or operators who are shipping hazardous waste which they generated at that facility.

              (d) As per 40 CFR 262.84(d)(2)(xv), within three (3) working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of a facility must provide a copy of the movement document bearing all required signatures to the foreign exporter; to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit that control the shipment as an export and transit shipment of hazardous waste respectively; and on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to EPA electronically using EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. The original copy of the movement document must be maintained at the facility for at least three (3) years from the date of signature. The owner or operator of a facility may satisfy this recordkeeping requirement by retaining electronically submitted documents in the facility's account on EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector. No owner or operator of a facility may be held liable for the inability to produce the documents for inspection under this section if the owner or operator of a facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, for which the owner or operator of a facility bears no responsibility.
              [70 FR 53453, Sept. 8, 2005, as amended at 81 FR 85728, Nov. 28, 2016; 81 FR 85827, Nov. 28, 2016]
            
            
              § 267.72
              Manifest discrepancies.
              (a) Manifest discrepancies are differences between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity or type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives. Significant discrepancies in quantity are:
              (1) For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight; and
              (2) For batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one drum in a truckload. Significant discrepancies in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not reported on the manifest or shipping paper.
              (b) Upon discovering a significant discrepancy, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (e.g., with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.
            
            
              § 267.73
              What information must I keep?
              (a) You must keep a written operating record at your facility.
              (b) You must record the following information, as it becomes available, and maintain the operating record until you close the facility:
              (1) A description and the quantity of each type of hazardous waste generated, and the method(s) and date(s) of its storage and/or treatment at the facility as required by Appendix I of 40 CFR part 264;
              (2) The location of each hazardous waste within the facility and the quantity at each location;
              (3) Records and results of waste analyses and waste determinations you perform as specified in §§ 267.13, 267.17, and 40 CFR 264.1034, 264.1063, 264.1083, and 268.7;
              (4) Summary reports and details of all incidents that require you to implement the contingency plan as specified in § 267.58(b));
              (5) Records and results of inspections as required by § 267.15(d) (except you need to keep these data for only three years);
              (6) Monitoring, testing or analytical data, and corrective action when required by subpart F of this part and §§ 267.191, 267.193, 267.195, and 40 CFR 264.1034(c) through 264.1034(f), 264.1035, 264.1063(d) through 264.1063(i), 264.1064, 264.1088, 264.1089, and 264.1090;

              (8) Your certification, at least annually, that you have a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous waste that you generate to the degree that you determine to be economically practicable; and that the proposed method of treatment or storage is that practicable method currently available to you that minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment;
              
              (9) For an on-site treatment facility, the information contained in the notice (except the manifest number), and the certification and demonstration, if applicable, required by you under 40 CFR 268.7; and
              (10) For an on-site storage facility, the information in the notice (except the manifest number), and the certification and demonstration, if applicable, required by you under 40 CFR 268.7.
              (11) For an off-site treatment facility, a copy of the notice, and the certification and demonstration, if applicable, required by the generator or the owner or operator under § 268.7 or § 268.8;
              (12) For an off-site storage facility, a copy of the notice, and the certification and demonstration, if applicable, required by the generator or the owner or operator under § 268.7 or § 268.8.
            
            
              § 267.74
              Who sees the records?
              (a) You must furnish all records, including plans, required under this part upon the request of any officer, employee, or representative of EPA who is duly designated by the Administrator, and make them available at all reasonable times for inspection.
              (b) The retention period for all records required under this part is extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action involving the facility or as requested by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 267.75
              What reports must I prepare and to whom do I send them?
              You must prepare a biennial report and other reports listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (a) Biennial report. You must prepare and submit a single copy of a biennial report to the Regional Administrator by March 1 of each even numbered year. The biennial report must be submitted on EPA form 8700-13B. The report must cover facility activities during the previous calendar year and must include:
              (1) The EPA identification number, name, and address of the facility;
              (2) The calendar year covered by the report;

              (2) Facility closures specified in § 267.117; and
              (3) As otherwise required by subparts I, J, and DD of this part and part 264, subparts AA, BB, CC.
              (c) For off-site facilities, the EPA identification number of each hazardous waste generator from which the facility received a hazardous waste during the year; for imported shipments, the report must give the name and address of the foreign generator;
              (d) A description and the quantity of each hazardous waste the facility received during the year. For off-site facilities, this information must be listed by EPA identification number of each generator.
            
            
              § 267.76
              What notifications must I make?
              Before transferring ownership or operation of a facility during its operating life, you must notify the new owner or operator in writing of the requirements of this part and 40 CFR part 270, subpart J.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Releases from Solid Waste Management Units
            
              § 267.90
              Who must comply with this section?

              This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility that treats or stores hazardous waste under a 40 CFR part 270, subpart J standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b), or unless your facility already has a permit that imposes requirements for corrective action under 40 CFR 264.101.
            
            
              §§ 267.91-267.100
              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 267.101
              What must I do to address corrective action for solid waste management units?
              (a) You must institute corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents from any solid waste management unit at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in such unit.
              (b) The Regional Administrator will specify corrective action in the supplemental portion of your standardized permit in accordance with this section and 40 CFR part 264, subpart S. The Regional Administrator will include in the supplemental portion of your standardized permit schedules of compliance for corrective action (where corrective action cannot be completed prior to issuance of the permit) and assurances of financial responsibility for completing corrective action.
              (c) You must implement corrective action beyond the facility property boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that, despite your best efforts, you were unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such actions. You are not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off -site access is denied. On-site measures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis. You must provide assurances of financial responsibility for such corrective action.
              (d) You do not have to comply with this section if you are the owner or operator of a remediation waste site unless your site is part of a facility that is subject to a permit for treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous wastes that are not remediation wastes.
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Closure
            
              § 267.110
              Does this subpart apply to me?
              This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility that treats or stores hazardous waste under a 40 CFR part 270, subpart J standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b).
            
            
              § 267.111
              What general standards must I meet when I stop operating the unit?
              You must close the storage and treatment units in a manner that:
              (a) Minimizes the need for further maintenance; and
              (b) Controls, minimizes, or eliminates, to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment, post-closure escape of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, leachate, contaminated run-off, or hazardous waste decomposition products to the ground or surface waters or to the atmosphere; and
              (c) Meets the closure requirements of this subpart and the requirements of §§ 267.176, 267.201, and 267.1108. If you determine that, when applicable, the closure requirements of § 267.201(tanks) or § 267.1108 (containment buildings) cannot be met, then you must close the unit in accordance with the requirements that apply to landfills (§ 264.310). In addition, for the purposes of post-closure and financial responsibility, such a tank system or containment building is then considered to be a landfill, and you must apply for a post-closure care permit in accordance with 40 CFR part 270.
            
            
              § 267.112
              What procedures must I follow?
              (a) To close a facility, you must follow your approved closure plan, and follow notification requirements.
              (1) Your closure plan must be submitted at the time you submitted your Notice of Intent to operate under a standardized permit. Final issuance of the standardized permit constitutes approval of the closure plan, and the plan becomes a condition of the RCRA standardized permit.

              (2) The Director's approval of the plan must ensure that the approved plan is consistent with §§ 267.111 through 267.115, 267.176, 267.201, and 267.1108.
              (b) Satisfy the requirements for content of closure plan. The closure plan must identify steps necessary to perform partial and/or final closure of the facility. The closure plan must include, at least:
              (1) A description of how each hazardous waste management unit at the facility subject to this subpart will be closed following § 267.111.
              (2) A description of how final closure of the facility will be conducted in accordance with § 267.111. The description must identify the maximum extent of the operations which will be unclosed during the active life of the facility.
              (3) An estimate of the maximum inventory of hazardous wastes ever on site during the active life of the facility and a detailed description of the methods you will use during partial and/or final closure, such as methods for removing, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of all hazardous wastes, and identification of the type(s) of off-site hazardous waste management units to be used, if applicable.
              (4) A detailed description of the steps needed to remove or decontaminate all hazardous waste residues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures, and soils during partial or final closure. These might include procedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination required to satisfy the closure performance standard;
              (5) A detailed description of other activities necessary during the closure period to ensure that partial or final closure satisfies the closure performance standards.
              (6) A schedule for closure of each hazardous waste management unit, and for final closure of the facility. The schedule must include, at a minimum, the total time required to close each hazardous waste management unit and the time required for intervening closure activities that allow tracking of progress of partial or final closure.
              (7) For facilities that use trust funds to establish financial assurance under § 267.143 and that are expected to close prior to the expiration of the permit, an estimate of the expected year of final closure.
              (c) You may submit a written notification to the Director for a permit modification to amend the closure plan at any time prior to the notification of partial or final closure of the facility, following the applicable procedures in 40 CFR 124.211.
              (1) Events leading to a change in the closure plan, and therefore requiring a modification, may include:
              (i) A change in the operating plan or facility design;
              (ii) A change in the expected year of closure, if applicable; or
              (iii) In conducting partial or final closure activities, an unexpected event requiring a modification of the approved closure plan.
              (2) The written notification or request must include a copy of the amended closure plan for review or approval by the Director. The Director will approve, disapprove, or modify this amended plan in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 124.211 and 270.320.
              (d) Notification before final closure. (1) You must notify the Director in writing at least 45 days before the date that you expect to begin final closure of a treatment or storage tank, container storage area, or containment building.
              (2) The date when you “expect to begin closure” must be no later than 30 days after the date that any hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of hazardous wastes.
              (3) If your facility's permit is terminated, or if you are otherwise ordered, by judicial decree or final order under section 3008 of RCRA, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to close, then the requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply. However, you must close the facility following the deadlines established in § 267.115.
            
            
              § 267.113
              Will the public have the opportunity to comment on the plan?

              (a) The Director will provide you and the public, when the draft standardized permit is public noticed, the opportunity to submit written comments on the plan and to the draft permit as allowed by 40 CFR 124.208. The Director will also, in response to a request or at his/her own discretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the closure plan, and the permit.
              (b) The Director will give public notice of the hearing 30 days before it occurs. Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to submit written comments, and the two notices may be combined.
            
            
              § 267.114
              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 267.115
              After I stop operating, how long until I must close?
              (a) Within 90 days after the final volume of hazardous waste is sent to a unit, you must treat or remove from the unit all hazardous wastes following the approved closure plan.
              (b) You must complete final closure activities in accordance with the approved closure plan within 180 days after the final volume of hazardous wastes is sent to the unit. The Director may approve an extension of 180 days to the closure period if you comply with all applicable requirements for requesting a modification to the permit and demonstrate that:
              (1) The final closure activities will take longer than 180 days to complete due to circumstances beyond your control, excluding ground water contamination; and
              (2) You have taken and will continue to take all steps to prevent threats to human health and the environment from the unclosed, but not operating hazardous waste management unit or facility, including compliance with all applicable permit requirements.
              (3) The demonstration must be made at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial 180-day period.
              (c) Nothing in this section precludes you from removing hazardous wastes and decontaminating or dismantling equipment in accordance with the approved final closure plan at any time before or after notification of final closure.
            
            
              § 267.116
              What must I do with contaminated equipment, structure, and soils?
              You must properly dispose of or decontaminate all contaminated equipment, structures, and soils during the partial and final closure periods. By removing any hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents during partial and final closure, you may become a generator of hazardous waste and must handle that waste following all applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 262.
            
            
              § 267.117
              How do I certify closure?
              Within 60 days of the completion of final closure of each unit under a part 270 subpart J standardized permit, you must submit to the Director, by registered mail, a certification that each hazardous waste management unit or facility, as applicable, has been closed following the specifications in the closure plan. Both you and an independent registered professional engineer must sign the certification. You must furnish documentation supporting the independent registered professional engineer's certification to the Director upon request until he releases you from the financial assurance requirements for closure under § 267.143(i).
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Financial Requirements
            
              § 267.140
              Who must comply with this subpart, and briefly, what do they have to do?
              (a) The regulations in this subpart apply to owners and operators who treat or store hazardous waste under a standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b), or § 267.140(d) below.
              (b) The owner or operator must:
              (1) Prepare a closure cost estimate as required in § 267.142;
              (2) Demonstrate financial assurance for closure as required in § 267.143; and
              (3) Demonstrate financial assurance for liability as required in § 267.147.

              (c) The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator if the owner or operator is named as a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code (See also § 267.148).
              
              (d) States and the Federal government are exempt from the requirements of this subpart.
            
            
              § 267.141
              Definitions of terms as used in this subpart.
              (a) Closure plan means the plan for closure prepared in accordance with the requirements of § 267.112.
              (b) Current closure cost estimate means the most recent of the estimates prepared in accordance with § 267.142 (a), (b), and (c).
              (c) [Reserved]
              (d) Parent corporation means a corporation which directly owns at least 50 percent of the voting stock of the corporation which is the facility owner or operator; the latter corporation is deemed a “subsidiary” of the parent corporation.
              (e) [Reserved]
              (f) The following terms are used in the specifications for the financial tests for closure and liability coverage. The definitions are intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit the meanings of terms in a way that conflicts with generally accepted accounting practices:
              
                Assets means all existing and all probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity.
              
                Current plugging and abandonment cost estimate means the most recent of the estimates prepared in accordance with § 144.62(a), (b), and (c) of this chapter.
              
                Independently audited refers to an audit performed by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
              
                Liabilities means probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events.
              
                Tangible net worth means the tangible assets that remain after deducting liabilities; such assets would not include intangibles such as goodwill and rights to patents or royalties.

              (g) In the liability insurance requirements, the terms bodily injury and property damage shall have the meanings given these terms by applicable State law. However, these terms do not include those liabilities which, consistent with standard industry practices, are excluded from coverage in liability policies for bodily injury and property damage. The Agency intends the meanings of other terms used in the liability insurance requirements to be consistent with their common meanings within the insurance industry. The definitions given below of several of the terms are intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit their meanings in a way that conflicts with general insurance industry usage.
              
                Accidental occurrence means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.
              
                Legal defense costs means any expenses that an insurer incurs in defending against claims of third parties brought under the terms and conditions of an insurance policy.
              
                Sudden accidental occurrence means an occurrence which is not continuous or repeated in nature.
              (h) Substantial business relationship means the extent of a business relationship necessary under applicable State law to make a guarantee contract issued incident to that relationship valid and enforceable. A “substantial business relationship” must arise from a pattern of recent or ongoing business transactions, in addition to the guarantee itself, such that a currently existing business relationship between the guarantor and the owner or operator is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the applicable EPA Regional Administrator.
            
            
              § 267.142
              Cost estimate for closure.
              (a) The owner or operator must have at the facility a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of closing the facility in accordance with the requirements in §§ 267.111 through 267.115 and applicable closure requirements in §§ 267.176, 267.201, 267.1108.

              (1) The estimate must equal the cost of final closure at the point in the facility's active life when the extent and manner of its operation would make closure the most expensive, as indicated by the closure plan (see § 267.112(b)); and
              (2) The closure cost estimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third party to close the facility. A third party is a party who is neither a parent nor a subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See definition of parent corporation in § 267.141(d).) The owner or operator may use costs for on-site disposal if he can demonstrate that on-site disposal capacity will exist at all times over the life of the facility.
              (3) The closure cost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the sale of hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes, facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets associated with the facility at the time of partial or final closure.
              (4) The owner or operator may not incorporate a zero cost for hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes that might have economic value.
              (b) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the closure cost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instrument(s) used to comply with § 267.143. For owners and operators using the financial test or corporate guarantee, the closure cost estimate must be updated for inflation within 30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before submission of updated information to the Regional Administrator as specified in § 267.143(f)(2)(iii). The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs of closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its Survey of Current Business, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year.
              (1) The first adjustment is made by multiplying the closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted closure cost estimate.
              (2) Subsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest adjusted closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.
              (c) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after the Regional Administrator has approved the request to modify the closure plan, if the change in the closure plan increases the cost of closure. The revised closure cost estimate must be adjusted for inflation as specified in § 267.142(b).
              (d) The owner or operator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of the facility: The latest closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the latest adjusted closure cost estimate.
            
            
              § 267.143
              Financial assurance for closure.
              The owner or operator must establish financial assurance for closure of each storage or treatment unit that he owns or operates. In establishing financial assurance for closure, the owner or operator must choose from the financial assurance mechanisms in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section. The owner or operator can also use a combination of mechanisms for a single facility if they meet the requirement in paragraph (h) of this section, or may use a single mechanism for multiple facilities as in paragraph (i) of this section. The Regional Administrator will release the owner or operator from the requirements of this section after the owner or operator meets the criteria under paragraph (j) of this section.
              (a) Closure Trust Fund. Owners and operators can use the “closure trust fund,” that is specified in 40 CFR 264.143(a)(1) and (2), and 264.143(a)(6)-(11). For purposes of this paragraph, the following provisions also apply:

              (1) Payments into the trust fund for a new facility must be made annually by the owner or operator over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, or over 3 years, whichever period is shorter. This period of time is hereafter referred to as the “pay-in period.”

              (2) For a new facility, the first payment into the closure trust fund must be made before the facility may accept the initial storage. A receipt from the trustee must be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator before this initial storage of waste. The first payment must be at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section for multiple mechanisms. Subsequent payments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The owner or operator determines the amount of each subsequent payment by subtracting the current value of the trust fund from the current closure cost estimate, and dividing this difference by the number of years remaining in the pay-in period. Mathematically, the formula is
              
              Next Payment = (Current Closure Estimate − Current Value of the Trust Fund) Divided by Years Remaining in the Pay-In Period.
              
              (3) The owner or operator of a facility existing on the effective date of this paragraph can establish a trust fund to meet this paragraph's financial assurance requirements. If the value of the trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate when a final approval of the permit is granted for the facility, the owner or operator must pay the difference into the trust fund within 60 days.
              (4) The owner or operator may accelerate payments into the trust fund or deposit the full amount of the closure cost estimate when establishing the trust fund. However, he must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
              (5) The owner or operator must submit a trust agreement with the wording specified in 40 CFR 264.151(a)(1).
              (b) Surety Bond Guaranteeing Payment into a Closure Trust Fund. Owners and operators can use the “surety bond guaranteeing payment into a closure trust fund,” as specified in 40 CFR 264.143(b), including the use of the surety bond instrument specified at 40 CFR 264.151(b), and the standby trust specified at 40 CFR 264.143(b)(3).
              (c) Surety Bond Guaranteeing Performance of Closure. Owners and operators can use the “surety bond guaranteeing performance of closure,” as specified in 40 CFR 264.143(c), the submission and use of the surety bond instrument specified at 40 CFR 264.151(c), and the standby trust specified at 40 CFR 264.143(c)(3).
              (d) Closure Letter of Credit. Owners and operators can use the “closure letter of credit” specified in 40 CFR 264.143(d), the submission and use of the irrevocable letter of credit instrument specified in 40 CFR 264.151(d), and the standby trust specified in 40 CFR 264.143(d)(3).
              (e) Closure Insurance. Owners and operators can use “closure insurance,” as specified in 40 CFR 264.143(e), utilizing the certificate of insurance for closure specified at 40 CFR 264.151(e).
              (f) Corporate financial test. An owner or operator that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph may demonstrate financial assurance up to the amount specified in this paragraph:
              (1) Financial component. (i) The owner or operator must satisfy one of the following three conditions:
              (A) A current rating for its senior unsecured debt of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; or
              (B) A ratio of less than 1.5 comparing total liabilities to net worth; or
              (C) A ratio of greater than 0.10 comparing the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, minus $10 million, to total liabilities.
              (ii) The tangible net worth of the owner or operator must be greater than:
              (A) The sum of the current environmental obligations (see paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section), including guarantees, covered by a financial test plus $10 million, except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

              (B) $10 million in tangible net worth plus the amount of any guarantees that have not been recognized as liabilities on the financial statements provided all of the environmental obligations (see paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section) covered by a financial test are recognized as liabilities on the owner's or operator's audited financial statements, and subject to the approval of the Regional Administrator.
              (iii) The owner or operator must have assets located in the United States amounting to at least the sum of environmental obligations covered by a financial test as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section.
              (2) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. (i) The owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:
              (A) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer that:
              (1) Lists all the applicable current types, amounts, and sums of environmental obligations covered by a financial test. These obligations include both obligations in the programs which EPA directly operates and obligations where EPA has delegated authority to a State or approved a State's program. These obligations include, but are not limited to:
              (i) Liability, closure, post-closure and corrective action cost estimates required for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR 264.101, 264.142, 264.144, 264.147, 265.142, 265.144, and 265.147;
              (ii) Cost estimates required for municipal solid waste management facilities under 40 CFR 258.71, 258.72, and 258.73;
              (iii) Current plugging cost estimates required for UIC facilities under 40 CFR 144.62;
              (iv) Cost estimates required for petroleum underground storage tank facilities under 40 CFR 280.93;
              (v) Cost estimates required for PCB storage facilities under 40 CFR 761.65;
              (vi) Any financial assurance required under, or as part of an action undertaken under, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and
              (vii) Any other environmental obligations that are assured through a financial test.
              (2) Provides evidence demonstrating that the firm meets the conditions of either paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) or (f)(1)(i)(B) or (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section and paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (B) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's unqualified opinion of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year. To be eligible to use the financial test, the owner's or operator's financial statements must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent certified public accountant. An adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance, with the potential exception for qualified opinions provided in the next sentence. The Regional Administrator may evaluate qualified opinions on a case-by-case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases where the Regional Administrator deems that the matters which form the basis for the qualification are insufficient to warrant disallowance of the test. If the Regional Administrator does not allow use of the test, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section within 30 days after the notification of disallowance.

              (C) If the chief financial officer's letter providing evidence of financial assurance includes financial data showing that the owner or operator satisfies paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) or (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section that are different from data in the audited financial statements referred to in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section or any other audited financial statement or data filed with the SEC, then a special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator is required. The special report shall be based upon an agreed upon procedures engagement in accordance with professional auditing standards and shall describe the procedures performed in comparing the data in the chief financial officer's letter derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements, the findings of that comparison, and the reasons for any differences.
              
              (D) If the chief financial officer's letter provides a demonstration that the firm has assured for environmental obligations as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, then the letter shall include a report from the independent certified public accountant that verifies that all of the environmental obligations covered by a financial test have been recognized as liabilities on the audited financial statements, how these obligations have been measured and reported, and that the tangible net worth of the firm is at least $10 million plus the amount of any guarantees provided.
              (ii) The owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before placing waste in the facility.
              (iii) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year. The Regional Administrator may provide up to an additional 45 days for an owner or operator who can demonstrate that 90 days is insufficient time to acquire audited financial statements. The updated information must consist of all items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
              (iv) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in this paragraph (f)(2) of this section or comply with the requirements of this paragraph (f) when:
              (A) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section that is not subject to these recordkeeping and reporting requirements; or
              (B) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.
              (v) An owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section cannot use the financial test to demonstrate financial assurance. Instead an owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must:
              (A) Send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The owner or operator must send this notice by certified mail within 90 days following the close the owner or operator's fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of this section.
              (B) Provide alternative financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
              (vi) The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require at any time the owner or operator to provide reports of its financial condition in addition to or including current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section.
              (g) Corporate Guarantee. (1) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee. The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraph (f) of this section and must comply with the terms of the guarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording in 40 CFR 264.151(h). The certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer and accountants' opinions. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee.
              (2) For a new facility, the guarantee must be effective and the guarantor must submit the items in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the owner or operator places waste in the facility.
              (3) The terms of the guarantee must provide that:
              (i) If the owner or operator fails to perform closure at a facility covered by the guarantee, the guarantor will:
              (A) Perform, or pay a third party to perform closure (performance guarantee); or
              (B) Establish a fully funded trust fund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the name of the owner or operator (payment guarantee).
              (ii) The guarantee will remain in force for as long as the owner or operator must comply with the applicable financial assurance requirements of this subpart unless the guarantor sends prior notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator as evidenced by the return receipts.
              (iii) If notice of cancellation is given, the owner or operator must, within 90 days following receipt of the cancellation notice by the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, obtain alternate financial assurance, and submit documentation for that alternate financial assurance to the Regional Administrator. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance and obtain the written approval of such alternative assurance from the Regional Administrator within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate assurance in the name of the owner or operator and submit the necessary documentation for the alternative assurance to the Regional Administrator within 120 days of the cancellation notice.
              (4) If a corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must, within 90 days, obtain alternative assurance, and submit the assurance to the Regional Administrator for approval. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate assurance within the next 30 days, and submit it to the Regional Administrator for approval.
              (5) The guarantor is no longer required to meet the requirements of this paragraph (g) when:
              (i) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or
              (ii) The owner or operator is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.
              (h) Use of Multiple Financial Mechanisms. An owner or operator may use more than one mechanism at a particular facility to satisfy the requirements of this section. The acceptable mechanisms are trust funds, surety bonds guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, insurance, the financial test, and the guarantee, except owners or operators cannot combine the financial test with the guarantee. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) respectively of this section, except it is the combination of mechanisms rather than a single mechanism that must provide assurance for an amount at least equal to the cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or letter of credit, he may use the trust fund as the standby trust for the other mechanisms. A single trust fund can be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for closure of the facility.
              (i) Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a financial mechanism for multiple facilities, as specified in § 264.143(h) of this chapter.
              (j) Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section. Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent registered professional engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that the owner or operator is no longer required by this section to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that final closure has not been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan. The Regional Administrator shall provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of any such reasons to believe that closure has not been conducted in accordance with the approved closure plan.

              (6) Guarantee for liability coverage. An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a guarantee as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
              (7) Combination of mechanisms. An owner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage through the use of combinations of mechanisms as allowed by 40 CFR 264.147(a)(6).
              (8) An owner or operator shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 30 days whenever:
              (i) A claim results in a reduction in the amount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial instrument authorized in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section; or
              (ii) A Certification of Valid Claim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner or operator and third-party claimant for liability coverage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section; or
              (iii) A final court order establishing a judgment for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is issued against the owner or operator or an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability coverage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section.
              (b)-(d) [Reserved]
              (e) Period of coverage. Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent registered professional engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required by this section to maintain liability coverage from that facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan.
              (f) Financial test for Liability Coverage. An owner or operator that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (f) may demonstrate financial assurance for liability up to the amount specified in this paragraph (f):
              (1) Financial component. (i) If using the financial test for only liability coverage, the owner or operator must have tangible net worth greater than the sum of the liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test plus $10 million.
              (ii) The owner or operator must have assets located in the United States amounting to at least the amount of liability covered by this financial test.
              (iii) An owner or operator who is demonstrating coverage for liability and any other environmental obligations, including closure under § 267.143(f), through a financial test must meet the requirements of § 267.143(f).
              (2) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
              (i) The owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:
              (A) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer that provides evidence demonstrating that the firm meets the conditions of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(1)(ii) of this section. If the firm is providing only liability coverage through a financial test for a facility or facilities with a permit under § 267, the letter should use the wording in § 267.151(b). If the firm is providing only liability coverage through a financial test for facilities regulated under part 267 and also part 264 or part 265, it should use the letter in § 264.151(g). If the firm is providing liability coverage through a financial test for a facility or facilities with a permit under § 267, and it assures closure costs or any other environmental obligations through a financial test, it must use the letter in § 267.151(a) for the facilities issued a permit under § 267.
              (B) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's unqualified opinion of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year. To be eligible to use the financial test, the owner's or operator's financial statements must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent certified public accountant. An adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance, with the potential exception for qualified opinions provided in the next sentence. The Regional Administrator may evaluate qualified opinions on a case-by-case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases where the Regional Administrator deems that the matters which form the basis for the qualification are insufficient to warrant disallowance of the test. If the Regional Administrator does not allow use of the test, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section (§ 267.147) within 30 days after the notification of disallowance.
              (C) If the chief financial officer's letter providing evidence of financial assurance includes financial data showing that the owner or operator satisfies paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section that are different from data in the audited financial statements referred to in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section or any other audited financial statement or data filed with the SEC, then a special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator is required. The special report shall be based upon an agreed upon procedures engagement in accordance with professional auditing standards and shall describe the procedures performed in comparing the data in the chief financial officer's letter derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements, the findings of that comparison, and the reasons for any differences.
              (ii) The owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before placing waste in the facility.

              (iii) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year. The Regional Administrator may provide up to an additional 45 days for an owner or operator who can demonstrate that 90 days is insufficient time to acquire audited financial statements. The updated information must consist of all items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
              (iv) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in this paragraph (f)(2) or comply with the requirements of this paragraph (f) when:
              (A) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section that is not subject to these recordkeeping and reporting requirements; or
              (B) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.
              (v) An owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section cannot use the financial test to demonstrate financial assurance. An owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must:
              (A) Send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The owner or operator must send this notice by certified mail within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of this section.
              (B) Provide alternative financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
              (vi) The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require at any time the owner or operator to provide reports of its financial condition in addition to or including current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section.
              (g) Guarantee for liability coverage. (1) Subject to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred to as “guarantee.” The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in 40 CFR 264.151(h)(2). A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, this letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee.
              (i) If the owner or operator fails to satisfy a judgment based on a determination of liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties caused by sudden accidental occurrences arising from the operation of facilities covered by this corporate guarantee, or fails to pay an amount agreed to in settlement of claims arising from or alleged to arise from such injury or damage, the guarantor will do so up to the limits of coverage.
              (ii) [Reserved]

              (2)(i) In the case of corporations incorporated in the United States, a guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if the Attorneys General or Insurance Commissioners of the State in which the guarantor is incorporated, and each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located, have submitted a written statement to EPA that a guarantee executed as described in this section and 40 CFR 264.151(h)(2) is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.
              (ii) In the case of corporations incorporated outside the United States, a guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if:
              (A) The non-U.S. corporation has identified a registered agent for service of process in each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located and in the State in which it has its principal place of business; and
              (B) The Attorney General or Insurance Commissioner of each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located and the State in which the guarantor corporation has its principal place of business, has submitted a written statement to EPA that a guarantee executed as described in this section and 40 CFR 264.151(h)(2) is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.

              § 267.148
              Incapacity of owners or operators, guarantors, or financial institutions.
              (a) An owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator by certified mail of the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming the owner or operator as debtor, within 10 days after commencement of the proceeding. A guarantor of a corporate guarantee as specified in §§ 267.143(g) and 267.147 (g) must make such a notification if he is named as debtor, as required under the terms of the corporate guarantee (§ 264.151(h)).
              (b) An owner or operator who fulfills the requirements of § 267.143 or § 267.147 by obtaining a trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy will be deemed to be without the required financial assurance or liability coverage in the event of bankruptcy of the trustee or issuing institution, or a suspension or revocation of the authority of the trustee institution to act as trustee or of the institution issuing the surety bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy to issue such instruments. The owner or operator must establish other financial assurance or liability coverage within 60 days after such an event.

              § 267.150
              State assumption of responsibility.

              (a) If a State either assumes legal responsibility for an owner's or operator's compliance with the closure care or liability requirements of this part or assures that funds will be available from State sources to cover those requirements, the owner or operator will be in compliance with the requirements of § 267.143 or § 267.147 if the Regional Administrator determines that the State's assumption of responsibility is at least equivalent to the financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of State guarantees principally in terms of: Certainty of the availability of funds for the required closure care activities or liability coverage; and the amount of funds that will be made available. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as he deems appropriate. The owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator a letter from the State describing the nature of the State's assumption of responsibility together with a letter from the owner or operator requesting that the State's assumption of responsibility be considered acceptable for meeting the requirements of this subpart. The letter from the State must include, or have attached to it, the following information: The facility's EPA Identification Number, name, and address, and the amount of funds for closure care or liability coverage that are guaranteed by the State. The Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator of his determination regarding the acceptability of the State's guarantee in lieu of financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator may require the owner or operator to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make this determination. Pending this determination, the owner or operator will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of § 267.143 or § 267.147, as applicable.
              (b) If a State's assumption of responsibility is found acceptable as specified in paragraph (a) of this section except for the amount of funds available, the owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this subpart by use of both the State's assurance and additional financial mechanisms as specified in this subpart. The amount of funds available through the State and Federal mechanisms must at least equal the amount required by this subpart.

            Subpart I—Use and Management of Containers
            
              § 267.170
              Does this subpart apply to me?
              This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility that treats or stores hazardous waste in containers under a 40 CFR part 270 subpart J standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b).
            
            
              § 267.171
              What standards apply to the containers?
              Standards apply to the condition of the containers, to the compatibility of waste with the containers, and to the management of the containers.
              (a) Condition of containers. If a container holding hazardous waste is not in good condition (for example, it exhibits severe rusting or apparent structural defects) or if it begins to leak, you must either:
              (1) Transfer the hazardous waste from this container to a container that is in good condition; or
              (2) Manage the waste in some other way that complies with the requirements of this part.
              (b) Compatibility of waste with containers. To ensure that the ability of the container to contain the waste is not impaired, you must use a container made of or lined with materials that are compatible and will not react with the hazardous waste to be stored.
              (c) Management of containers. (1) You must always keep a container holding hazardous waste closed during storage, except when you add or remove waste.
              (2) You must never open, handle, or store a container holding hazardous waste in a manner that may rupture the container or cause it to leak.
            
            
              § 267.172
              What are the inspection requirements?
              At least weekly, you must inspect areas where you store containers, looking for leaking containers and for deterioration of containers and the containment system caused by corrosion or other factors.
            
            
              
              § 267.173
              What standards apply to the container storage areas?
              (a) You must design and operate a containment system for your container storage areas according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, except as otherwise provided by paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) The design and operating requirements for a containment system are:
              (1) A base must underlie the containers that is free of cracks or gaps and is sufficiently impervious to contain leaks, spills, and accumulated precipitation until the collected material is detected and removed.

Storage and/or treatment in your containment building is not land disposal as defined in 40 CFR 268.2 if your unit meets the requirements of §§ 267.1101, 267.1102, and 267.1103.
            
            
              § 267.1101
              What design and operating standards must my containment building meet?
              Your containment building must comply with the design and operating standards in this section. EPA will consider standards established by professional organizations generally recognized by the industry such as the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) in judging the structural integrity requirements of this section.
              (a) The containment building must be completely enclosed with a floor, walls, and a roof to prevent exposure to the elements, (e.g., precipitation, wind, run-on), and to assure containment of managed wastes.
              (b) The floor and containment walls of the unit, including the secondary containment system, if required under § 267.1103, must be designed and constructed of manmade materials of sufficient strength and thickness to:
              (1) Support themselves, the waste contents, and any personnel and heavy equipment that operates within the unit.
              (2) Prevent failure due to:
              (i) Pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or uplift.
              (ii) Physical contact with the hazardous wastes to which they are exposed.
              (iii) Climatic conditions.
              (iv) Stresses of daily operation, including the movement of heavy equipment within the unit and contact of such equipment with containment walls.
              (v) Collapse or other failure.
              (c) All surfaces to be in contact with hazardous wastes must be chemically compatible with those wastes.
              (d) You must not place incompatible hazardous wastes or treatment reagents in the unit or its secondary containment system if they could cause the unit or secondary containment system to leak, corrode, or otherwise fail.
              (e) A containment building must have a primary barrier designed to withstand the movement of personnel, waste, and handling equipment in the unit during the operating life of the unit and appropriate for the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be managed.
              (f) If appropriate to the nature of the waste management operation to take place in the unit, an exception to the structural strength requirement may be made for light-weight doors and windows that meet these criteria:
              (1) They provide an effective barrier against fugitive dust emissions under § 267.1102(d).
              (2) The unit is designed and operated in a fashion that assures that wastes will not actually come in contact with these openings.
              (g) You must inspect and record in the facility's operating record, at least once every seven days, data gathered from monitoring equipment and leak detection equipment, as well as the containment building and the area immediately surrounding the containment building to detect signs of releases of hazardous waste.
              (h) You must obtain certification by a qualified registered professional engineer that the containment building design meets the requirements of §§ 267.1102, 267.1103, and paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
            
            
              § 267.1102
              What other requirements must I meet to prevent releases?
              You must use controls and practices to ensure containment of the hazardous waste within the unit, and must, at a minimum:
              (a) Maintain the primary barrier to be free of significant cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other deterioration that could cause hazardous waste to be released from the primary barrier.
              (b) Maintain the level of the stored/treated hazardous waste within the containment walls of the unit so that the height of any containment wall is not exceeded.
              (c) Take measures to prevent personnel or by equipment used in handling the waste from tracking hazardous waste out of the unit. You must designate an area to decontaminate equipment, and you must collect and properly manage any rinsate.

              (d) Take measures to control fugitive dust emissions such that any openings (doors, windows, vents, cracks, etc.) exhibit no visible emissions (see 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 22—Visual Determination of Fugitive Emissions from Material Sources and Smoke Emissions from Flares). In addition, you must operate and maintain all associated particulate collection devices (for example, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator) with sound air pollution control practices. You must effectively maintain this state of no visible emissions at all times during routine operating and maintenance conditions, including when vehicles and personnel are entering and exiting the unit.
            
            
              § 267.1103
              What additional design and operating standards apply if liquids will be in my containment building?
              If your containment building will be used to manage hazardous wastes containing free liquids or treated with free liquids, as determined by the paint filter test, by a visual examination, or by other appropriate means, you must include:
              (a) A primary barrier designed and constructed of materials to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier (for example, a geomembrane covered by a concrete wear surface).
              (b) A liquid collection and removal system to minimize the accumulation of liquid on the primary barrier of the containment building.
              (1) The primary barrier must be sloped to drain liquids to the associated collection system; and
              (2) You must collect and remove liquids and waste to minimize hydraulic head on the containment system at the earliest practicable time.
              (c) A secondary containment system, including a secondary barrier designed and constructed to prevent migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier, and a leak detection system capable of detecting failure of the primary barrier and collecting accumulated hazardous wastes and liquids at the earliest practical time.
              (1) You may meet the requirements of the leak detection component of the secondary containment system by installing a system that is, at a minimum:
              (i) Constructed with a bottom slope of 1 percent or more; and

              (ii) Constructed of a granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 × 10−2 cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more, or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3 × 10-5 m2sec or more.
              (2) If you will be conducting treatment in the building, you must design the area in which the treatment will be conducted to prevent the release of liquids, wet materials, or liquid aerosols to other portions of the building.
              (3) You must construct the secondary containment system using materials that are chemically resistant to the waste and liquids managed in the containment building and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressure exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used in the containment building.
            
            
              § 267.1104
              How may I obtain a waiver from secondary containment requirements?
              Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Regional Administrator may waive requirements for secondary containment for a permitted containment building where:
              (a) You demonstrate that the only free liquids in the unit are limited amounts of dust suppression liquids required to meet occupational health and safety requirements, and
              (b) Containment of managed wastes and dust suppression liquids can be assured without a secondary containment system.
            
            
              § 267.1105
              What do I do if my containment building contains areas both with and without secondary containment?
              For these containment buildings, you must:
              (a) Design and operate each area in accordance with the requirements enumerated in §§ 267.1101 through 267.1103.
              (b) Take measures to prevent the release of liquids or wet materials into areas without secondary containment.

              (c) Maintain in the facility's operating log a written description of the operating procedures used to maintain the integrity of areas without secondary containment.
            
            
              § 267.1106
              What do I do if I detect a release?
              Throughout the active life of the containment building, if you detect a condition that could lead to or has caused a release of hazardous waste, you must repair the condition promptly, in accordance with the following procedures.
              (a) Upon detection of a condition that has lead to a release of hazardous waste (for example, upon detection of leakage from the primary barrier), you must:
              (1) Enter a record of the discovery in the facility operating record;
              (2) Immediately remove the portion of the containment building affected by the condition from service;
              (3) Determine what steps you must take to repair the containment building, to remove any leakage from the secondary collection system, and to establish a schedule for accomplishing the cleanup and repairs; and
              (4) Within 7 days after the discovery of the condition, notify the Regional Administrator of the condition, and within 14 working days, provide a written notice to the Regional Administrator with a description of the steps taken to repair the containment building, and the schedule for accomplishing the work.
              (b) The Regional Administrator will review the information submitted, make a determination regarding whether the containment building must be removed from service completely or partially until repairs and cleanup are complete, and notify you of the determination and the underlying rationale in writing.
              (c) Upon completing all repairs and cleanup, you must notify the Regional Administrator in writing and provide a verification, signed by a qualified, registered professional engineer, that the repairs and cleanup have been completed according to the written plan submitted in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
            
            
              § 267.1107
              Can a containment building itself be considered secondary containment?
              Containment buildings can serve as secondary containment systems for tanks placed within the building under certain conditions.
              (a) A containment building can serve as an external liner system for a tank, provided it meets the requirements of § 267.196(a).
              (b) The containment building must also meet the requirements of § 267.195(a), (b)(1) and (2) to be considered an acceptable secondary containment system for a tank.
            
            
              § 267.1108
              What must I do when I stop operating the containment building?
              When you close a containment building, you must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste and leachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless 40 CFR 261.3(d) applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for closure, and financial responsibility for containment buildings must meet all of the requirements specified in subparts G and H of this part.

However, the following materials are not debris: any material for which a specific treatment standard is provided in Subpart D, Part 268, namely lead acid batteries, cadmium batteries, and radioactive lead solids; process residuals such as smelter slag and residues from the treatment of waste, wastewater, sludges, or air emission residues; and intact containers of hazardous waste that are not ruptured and that retain at least 75% of their original volume. A mixture of debris that has not been treated to the standards provided by § 268.45 and other material is subject to regulation as debris if the mixture is comprised primarily of debris, by volume, based on visual inspection.
              (h) Hazardous debris means debris that contains a hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter, or that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter. Any deliberate mixing of prohibited hazardous waste with debris that changes its treatment classification (i.e., from waste to hazardous debris) is not allowed under the dilution prohibition in § 268.3.
              (i) Underlying hazardous constituent means any constituent listed in § 268.48, Table UTS—Universal Treatment Standards, except fluoride, selenium, sulfides, vanadium, and zinc, which can reasonably be expected to be present at the point of generation of the hazardous waste at a concentration above the constituent-specific UTS treatment standards.
              (j) Inorganic metal-bearing waste is one for which EPA has established treatment standards for metal hazardous constituents, and which does not otherwise contain significant organic or cyanide content as described in § 268.3(c)(1), and is specifically listed in appendix XI of this part.
              (k) Soil means unconsolidated earth material composing the superficial geologic strata (material overlying bedrock), consisting of clay, silt, sand, or gravel size particles as classified by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or a mixture of such materials with liquids, sludges or solids which is inseparable by simple mechanical removal processes and is made up primarily of soil by volume based on visual inspection. Any deliberate mixing of prohibited hazardous waste with soil that changes its treatment classification (i.e., from waste to contaminated soil) is not allowed under the dilution prohibition in § 268.3.

              § 268.3
              Dilution prohibited as a substitute for treatment.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no generator, transporter, handler, or owner or operator of a treatment, storage, or disposal facility shall in any way dilute a restricted waste or the residual from treatment of a restricted waste as a substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with subpart D of this part, to circumvent the effective date of a prohibition in subpart C of this part, to otherwise avoid a prohibition in subpart C of this part, or to circumvent a land disposal prohibition imposed by RCRA section 3004.

              (b) Dilution of wastes that are hazardous only because they exhibit a characteristic in treatment systems which include land- based units which treat wastes subsequently discharged to a water of the United States pursuant to a permit issued under section 402 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), or which treat wastes in a CWA-equivalent treatment system, or which treat wastes for the purposes of pretreatment requirements under section 307 of the CWA is not impermissible dilution for purposes of this section unless a method other than DEACT has been specified in § 268.40 as the treatment standard, or unless the waste is a D003 reactive cyanide wastewater or nonwastewater.
              (c) Combustion of the hazardous waste codes listed in Appendix XI of this part is prohibited, unless the waste, at the point of generation, or after any bona fide treatment such as cyanide destruction prior to combustion, can be demonstrated to comply with one or more of the following criteria (unless otherwise specifically prohibited from combustion):
              (1) The waste contains hazardous organic constituents or cyanide at levels exceeding the constituent-specific treatment standard found in § 268.48;
              (2) The waste consists of organic, debris-like materials (e.g., wood, paper, plastic, or cloth) contaminated with an inorganic metal-bearing hazardous waste;
              (3) The waste, at point of generation, has reasonable heating value such as greater than or equal to 5000 BTU per pound;
              (4) The waste is co-generated with wastes for which combustion is a required method of treatment;
              (5) The waste is subject to Federal and/or State requirements necessitating reduction of organics (including biological agents); or
              (6) The waste contains greater than 1% Total Organic Carbon (TOC).
              (d) It is a form of impermissible dilution, and therefore prohibited, to add iron filings or other metallic forms of iron to lead-containing hazardous wastes in order to achieve any land disposal restriction treatment standard for lead. Lead-containing wastes include D008 wastes (wastes exhibiting a characteristic due to the presence of lead), all characteristic wastes containing lead as an underlying hazardous constituent, listed wastes containing lead as a regulated constituent, and hazardous media containing any of the aforementioned lead-containing wastes.

              § 268.4
              Treatment surface impoundment exemption.
              (a) Wastes which are otherwise prohibited from land disposal under this part may be treated in a surface impoundment or series of impoundments provided that:
              (1) Treatment of such wastes occurs in the impoundments;
              (2) The following conditions are met:
              (i) Sampling and testing. For wastes with treatment standards in subpart D of this part and/or prohibition levels in subpart C of this part or RCRA section 3004(d), the residues from treatment are analyzed, as specified in § 268.7 or § 268.32, to determine if they meet the applicable treatment standards or where no treatment standards have been established for the waste, the applicable prohibition levels. The sampling method, specified in the waste analysis plan under § 264.13 or § 265.13, must be designed such that representative samples of the sludge and the supernatant are tested separately rather than mixed to form homogeneous samples.
              (ii) Removal. The following treatment residues (including any liquid waste) must be removed at least annually; residues which do not meet the treatment standards promulgated under subpart D of this part; residues which do not meet the prohibition levels established under subpart C of this part or imposed by statute (where no treatment standards have been established); residues which are from the treatment of wastes prohibited from land disposal under subpart C of this part (where no treatment standards have been established and no prohibition levels apply); or residues from managing listed wastes which are not delisted under § 260.22 of this chapter. If the volume of liquid flowing through the impoundment or series of impoundments annually is greater than the volume of the impoundment or impoundments, this flow-through constitutes removal of the supernatant for the purpose of this requirement.
              (iii) Subsequent management. Treatment residues may not be placed in any other surface impoundment for subsequent management.
              (iv) Recordkeeping. Sampling and testing and recordkeeping provisions of §§ 264.13 and 265.13 of this chapter apply.
              (3) The impoundment meets the design requirements of § 264.221(c) or § 265.221(a) of this chapter, regardless that the unit may not be new, expanded, or a replacement, and be in compliance with applicable ground water monitoring requirements of subpart F of part 264 or part 265 of this chapter unless:
              (i) Exempted pursuant to § 264.221 (d) or (e) of this chapter, or to § 265.221 (c) or (d) of this chapter; or,
              (ii) Upon application by the owner or operator, the Administrator, after notice and an opportunity to comment, has granted a waiver of the requirements on the basis that the surface impoundment:
              (A) Has at least one liner, for which there is no evidence that such liner is leaking;
              (B) Is located more than one-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking water; and
              (C) Is in compliance with generally applicable ground water monitoring requirements for facilities with permits; or,
              (iii) Upon application by the owner or operator, the Administrator, after notice and an opportunity to comment, has granted a modification to the requirements on the basis of a demonstration that the surface impoundment is located, designed, and operated so as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at any future time.

              (4) The owner or operator submits to the Regional Administrator a written certification that the requirements of § 268.4(a)(3) have been met. The following certification is required:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that the requirements of 40 CFR 268.4(a)(3) have been met for all surface impoundments being used to treat restricted wastes. I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (b) Evaporation of hazardous constituents as the principal means of treatment is not considered to be treatment for purposes of an exemption under this section.

              § 268.5
              Procedures for case-by-case extensions to an effective date.
              (a) Any person who generates, treats, stores, or disposes of a hazardous waste may submit an application to the Administrator for an extension to the effective date of any applicable restriction established under subpart C of this part. The applicant must demonstrate the following:
              (1) He has made a good-faith effort to locate and contract with treatment, recovery, or disposal facilities nationwide to manage his waste in accordance with the effective date of the applicable restriction established under subpart C of this part;
              (2) He has entered into a binding contractual commitment to construct or otherwise provide alternative treatment, recovery (e.g., recycling), or disposal capacity that meets the treatment standards specified in subpart D or, where treatment standards have not been specified, such treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity is protective of human health and the environment.
              (3) Due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, such alternative capacity cannot reasonably be made available by the applicable effective date. This demonstration may include a showing that the technical and practical difficulties associated with providing the alternative capacity will result in the capacity not being available by the applicable effective date;
              (4) The capacity being constructed or otherwise provided by the applicant will be sufficient to manage the entire quantity of waste that is the subject of the application;

              (5) He provides a detailed schedule for obtaining required operating and construction permits or an outline of how and when alternative capacity will be available;
              (6) He has arranged for adequate capacity to manage his waste during an extension and has documented in the application the location of all sites at which the waste will be managed; and
              (7) Any waste managed in a surface impoundment or landfill during the extension period will meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

              (b) An authorized representative signing an application described under paragraph (a) of this section shall make the following certification:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this document and all attachments and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (c) After receiving an application for an extension, the Administrator may request any additional information which he deems as necessary to evaluate the application.
              (d) An extension will apply only to the waste generated at the individual facility covered by the application and will not apply to restricted waste from any other facility.

              (e) On the basis of the information referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, after notice and opportunity for comment, and after consultation with appropriate State agencies in all affected States, the Administrator may grant an extension of up to 1 year from the effective date. The Administrator may renew this extension for up to 1 additional year upon the request of the applicant if the demonstration required in paragraph (a) of this section can still be made. In no event will an extension extend beyond 24 months from the applicable effective date specified in subpart C of part 268. The length of any extension authorized will be determined by the Administrator based on the time required to construct or obtain the type of capacity needed by the applicant as described in the completion schedule discussed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The Administrator will give public notice of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a petition will be published in the Federal Register.
              
              (f) Any person granted an extension under this section must immediately notify the Administrator as soon as he has knowledge of any change in the conditions certified to in the application.
              (g) Any person granted an extension under this section shall submit written progress reports at intervals designated by the Administrator. Such reports must describe the overall progress made toward constructing or otherwise providing alternative treatment, recovery or disposal capacity; must identify any event which may cause or has caused a delay in the development of the capacity; and must summarize the steps taken to mitigate the delay. The Administrator can revoke the extension at any time if the applicant does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to meet the schedule for completion, if the Agency denies or revokes any required permit, if conditions certified in the application change, or for any violation of this chapter.
              (h) Whenever the Administrator establishes an extension to an effective date under this section, during the period for which such extension is in effect:
              (1) The storage restrictions under § 268.50(a) do not apply; and
              (2) Such hazardous waste may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only if such unit is in compliance with the technical requirements of the following provisions regardless of whether such unit is existing, new, or a replacement or lateral expansion.
              (i) The landfill, if in interim status, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 and § 265.301 (a), (c), and (d) of this chapter; or,
              (ii) The landfill, if permitted, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 264 and § 264.301 (c), (d) and (e) of this chapter; or

              (iii) The surface impoundment, if in interim status, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265, § 265.221 (a), (c), and (d) of this chapter, and RCRA section 3005(j)(1); or
              (iv) The surface impoundment, if permitted, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 264 and § 264.221 (c), (d) and (e) of this chapter; or
              (v) The surface impoundment, if newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for the identification of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 of this chapter within 12 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, and with the requirements of § 265.221 (a), (c) and (d) of this chapter within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste. If a national capacity variance is granted, during the period the variance is in effect, the surface impoundment, if newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 of this chapter within 12 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, and with the requirements of § 265.221 (a), (c) and (d) of this chapter within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste; or
              (vi) The landfill, if disposing of containerized liquid hazardous wastes containing PCBs at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm but less than 500 ppm, is also in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 761.75 and parts 264 and 265.
              (i) Pending a decision on the application the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.

              (b) The demonstration referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must meet the following criteria:
              (1) All waste and environmental sampling, test, and analysis data must be accurate and reproducible to the extent that state-of-the-art techniques allow;
              (2) All sampling, testing, and estimation techniques for chemical and physical properties of the waste and all environmental parameters must have been approved by the Administrator;
              (3) Simulation models must be calibrated for the specific waste and site conditions, and verified for accuracy by comparison with actual measurements;
              (4) A quality assurance and quality control plan that addresses all aspects of the demonstration must be approved by the Administrator; and,

              (5) An analysis must be performed to identify and quantify any aspects of the demonstration that contribute significantly to uncertainty. This analysis must include an evaluation of the consequences of predictable future events, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, floods, severe storm events, droughts, or other natural phenomena.
              (c) Each petition referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must include the following:
              (1) A monitoring plan that describes the monitoring program installed at and/or around the unit to verify continued compliance with the conditions of the variance. This monitoring plan must provide information on the monitoring of the unit and/or the environment around the unit. The following specific information must be included in the plan:
              (i) The media monitored in the cases where monitoring of the environment around the unit is required;
              (ii) The type of monitoring conducted at the unit, in the cases where monitoring of the unit is required;
              (iii) The location of the monitoring stations;
              (iv) The monitoring interval (frequency of monitoring at each station);
              (v) The specific hazardous constituents to be monitored;
              (vi) The implementation schedule for the monitoring program;
              (vii) The equipment used at the monitoring stations;
              (viii) The sampling and analytical techniques employed; and
              (ix) The data recording/reporting procedures.
              (2) Where applicable, the monitoring program described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be in place for a period of time specified by the Administrator, as part of his approval of the petition, prior to receipt of prohibited waste at the unit.
              (3) The monitoring data collected according to the monitoring plan specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be sent to the Administrator according to a format and schedule specified and approved in the monitoring plan, and
              (4) A copy of the monitoring data collected under the monitoring plan specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be kept on-site at the facility in the operating record.
              (5) The monitoring program specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section meets the following criteria:
              (i) All sampling, testing, and analytical data must be approved by the Administrator and must provide data that is accurate and reproducible.
              (ii) All estimation and monitoring techniques must be approved by the Administrator.
              (iii) A quality assurance and quality control plan addressing all aspects of the monitoring program must be provided to and approved by the Administrator.
              (d) Each petition must be submitted to the Administrator.
              (e) After a petition has been approved, the owner or operator must report any changes in conditions at the unit and/or the environment around the unit that significantly depart from the conditions described in the variance and affect the potential for migration of hazardous constituents from the units as follows:
              (1) If the owner or operator plans to make changes to the unit design, construction, or operation, such a change must be proposed, in writing, and the owner or operator must submit a demonstration to the Administrator at least 30 days prior to making the change. The Administrator will determine whether the proposed change invalidates the terms of the petition and will determine the appropriate response. Any change must be approved by the Administrator prior to being made.
              (2) If the owner or operator discovers that a condition at the site which was modeled or predicted in the petition does not occur as predicted, this change must be reported, in writing, to the Administrator within 10 days of discovering the change. The Administrator will determine whether the reported change from the terms of the petition requires further action, which may include termination of waste acceptance and revocation of the petition, petition modifications, or other responses.
              (f) If the owner or operator determines that there is migration of hazardous constituent(s) from the unit, the owner or operator must:
              (1) Immediately suspend receipt of prohibited waste at the unit, and

              (2) Notify the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days of the determination that a release has occurred.
              
              (3) Following receipt of the notification the Administrator will determine, within 60 days of receiving notification, whether the owner or operator can continue to receive prohibited waste in the unit and whether the variance is to be revoked. The Administrator shall also determine whether further examination of any migration is warranted under applicable provisions of part 264 or part 265.

              (g) Each petition must include the following statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (h) After receiving a petition, the Administrator may request any additional information that reasonably may be required to evaluate the demonstration.
              (i) If approved, the petition will apply to land disposal of the specific restricted waste at the individual disposal unit described in the demonstration and will not apply to any other restricted waste at that disposal unit, or to that specific restricted waste at any other disposal unit.
              (j) The Administrator will give public notice in the Federal Register of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a petition will be published in the Federal Register.
              
              (k) The term of a petition granted under this section shall be no longer than the term of the RCRA permit if the disposal unit is operating under a RCRA permit, or up to a maximum of 10 years from the date of approval provided under paragraph (g) of this section if the unit is operating under interim status. In either case, the term of the granted petition shall expire upon the termination or denial of a RCRA permit, or upon the termination of interim status or when the volume limit of waste to be land disposed during the term of petition is reached.
              (l) Prior to the Administrator's decision, the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.
              (m) The petition granted by the Administrator does not relieve the petitioner of his responsibilities in the management of hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 260 through part 271.

              § 268.7
              Testing, tracking, and recordkeeping requirements for generators, treaters, and disposal facilities.
              (a) Requirements for generators: (1) A generator of hazardous waste must determine if the waste has to be treated before it can be land disposed. This is done by determining if the hazardous waste meets the treatment standards in § 268.40, 268.45, or § 268.49. This determination can be made concurrently with the hazardous waste determination required in § 262.11 of this chapter, in either of two ways: testing the waste or using knowledge of the waste. If the generator tests the waste, testing would normally determine the total concentration of hazardous constituents, or the concentration of hazardous constituents in an extract of the waste obtained using test method 1311 in “Test Methods of Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, (incorporated by reference, see § 260.11 of this chapter), depending on whether the treatment standard for the waste is expressed as a total concentration or concentration of hazardous constituent in the waste's extract. (Alternatively, the generator must send the waste to a RCRA-permitted hazardous waste treatment facility, where the waste treatment facility must comply with the requirements of § 264.13 of this chapter and paragraph (b) of this section.) In addition, some hazardous wastes must be treated by particular treatment methods before they can be land disposed and some soils are contaminated by such hazardous wastes. These treatment standards are also found in § 268.40, and are described in detail in § 268.42, Table 1. These wastes, and soils contaminated with such wastes, do not need to be tested (however, if they are in a waste mixture, other wastes with concentration level treatment standards would have to be tested). If a generator determines they are managing a waste or soil contaminated with a waste, that displays a hazardous characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity, they must comply with the special requirements of § 268.9 of this part in addition to any applicable requirements in this section.
              (2) If the waste or contaminated soil does not meet the treatment standards, or if the generator chooses not to make the determination of whether his waste must be treated, with the initial shipment of waste to each treatment or storage facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each treatment or storage facility receiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column “268.7(a)(2)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. (Alternatively, if the generator chooses not to make the determination of whether the waste must be treated, the notification must include the EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers and Manifest Number of the first shipment and must state “This hazardous waste may or may not be subject to the LDR treatment standards. The treatment facility must make the determination.”) No further notification is necessary until such time that the waste or facility change, in which case a new notification must be sent and a copy placed in the generator's file.
              (3) If the waste or contaminated soil meets the treatment standard at the original point of generation:

              (i) With the initial shipment of waste to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility receiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information indicated in column “268.7(a)(3)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in § 268.7(a)(4) and the following certification statement, signed by an authorized representative:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment standards specified in 40 CFR part 268 subpart D. I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (ii) For contaminated soil, with the initial shipment of wastes to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each facility receiving the waste and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column “268.7(a)(3)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in § 268.7(a)(4).
              (iii) If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice and certification to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their files. Generators of hazardous debris excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under § 261.3(f) of this chapter are not subject to these requirements.

              (4) For reporting, tracking, and recordkeeping when exceptions allow certain wastes or contaminated soil that do not meet the treatment standards to be land disposed: There are certain exemptions from the requirement that hazardous wastes or contaminated soil meet treatment standards before they can be land disposed. These include, but are not limited to case-by-case extensions under § 268.5, disposal in a no-migration unit under § 268.6, or a national capacity variance or case-by-case capacity variance under subpart C of this part. If a generator's waste is so exempt, then with the initial shipment of waste, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each land disposal facility receiving the waste. The notice must include the information indicated in column “268.7(a)(4)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table below. If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their files.

              (5) If a generator is managing and treating prohibited waste or contaminated soil in tanks, containers, or containment buildings regulated under 40 CFR 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17 to meet applicable LDR treatment standards found at § 268.40, the generator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes the procedures they will carry out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating hazardous debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1 to § 268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's records, and the following requirements must be met:
              (i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this part, including the selected testing frequency.
              (ii) Such plan must be kept in the facility's on-site files and made available to inspectors.
              (iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must comply with the notification requirements of § 268.7(a)(3).
              (6) If a generator determines that the waste or contaminated soil is restricted based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used to make this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's files. If a generator determines that the waste is restricted based on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method 1311 in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, as referenced in § 260.11 of this chapter, and all waste analysis data must be retained on-site in the generator's files.

              (7) If a generator determines that he is managing a prohibited waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or is exempted from Subtitle C regulation under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6 subsequent to the point of generation (including deactivated characteristic hazardous wastes managed in wastewater treatment systems subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA) as specified at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(2) or that are CWA-equivalent, or are managed in an underground injection well regulated by the SDWA), he must place a one-time notice describing such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exemption from RCRA Subtitle C regulation, and the disposition of the waste, in the facility's on-site files.
              (8) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices, certifications, waste analysis data, and other documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least three years from the date that the waste that is the subject of such documentation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. The three year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator. The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even when the hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the waste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6, or exempted from Subtitle C regulation, subsequent to the point of generation.
              (9) If a generator is managing a lab pack containing hazardous wastes and wishes to use the alternative treatment standard for lab packs found at § 268.42(c):

              (i) With the initial shipment of waste to a treatment facility, the generator must submit a notice that provides the information in column “§ 268.7(a)(9)” in the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and the following certification. The certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative and must be placed in the generator's files, must say the following:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste and that the lab pack contains only wastes that have not been excluded under appendix IV to 40 CFR part 268 and that this lab pack will be sent to a combustion facility in compliance with the alternative treatment standards for lab packs at 40 CFR 268.42(c). I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.
              
              
              (ii) No further notification is necessary until such time that the wastes in the lab pack change, or the receiving facility changes, in which case a new notice and certification must be sent and a copy placed in the generator's file.
              (iii) If the lab pack contains characteristic hazardous wastes (D001-D043), underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in § 268.2(i)) need not be determined.
              (iv) The generator must also comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section.
              (10) Small quantity generators with tolling agreements pursuant to 40 CFR 262.20(e) must comply with the applicable notification and certification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the initial shipment of the waste subject to the agreement. Such generators must retain on-site a copy of the notification and certification, together with the tolling agreement, for at least three years after termination or expiration of the agreement. The three-year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.
              (b) Treatment facilities must test their wastes according to the frequency specified in their waste analysis plans as required by 40 CFR 264.13 (for permitted TSDs) or 40 CFR 265.13 (for interim status facilities). Such testing must be performed as provided in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.

              (1) For wastes or contaminated soil with treatment standards expressed in the waste extract (TCLP), the owner or operator of the treatment facility must test an extract of the treatment residues, using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846 as incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter) to assure that the treatment residues extract meet the applicable treatment standards.
              (2) For wastes or contaminated soil with treatment standards expressed as concentrations in the waste, the owner or operator of the treatment facility must test the treatment residues (not an extract of such residues) to assure that they meet the applicable treatment standards.
              (3) A one-time notice must be sent with the initial shipment of waste or contaminated soil to the land disposal facility. A copy of the notice must be placed in the treatment facility's file.
              (i) No further notification is necessary until such time that the waste or receiving facility change, in which case a new notice must be sent and a copy placed in the treatment facility's file.
              (ii) The one-time notice must include these requirements:

The constituents of concern for F001-F005, and F039, and underlying hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes, unless the waste will be treated and monitored for all constituents. If all constituents will be treated and monitored, there is no need to put them all on the LDR notice.
                  ✔
                
                
                  3. The notice must include the applicable wastewater/ nonwastewater category (see §§ 268.2(d) and (f)) and subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste-specific criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanide)
                  ✔
                
                
                  4. Waste analysis data (when available)
                  ✔
                
                
                  5. For contaminated soil subject to LDRs as provided in 268.49(a), the constituents subject to treatment as described in 268.49(d) and the following statement, “this contaminated soil [does/does not] exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste and [is subject to/complies with] the soil treatment standards as provided by 268.49(c)”.
                  ✔
                
                
                  6. A certification is needed (see applicable section for exact wording)
                  ✔
                
              

              (4) The treatment facility must submit a one-time certification signed by an authorized representative with the initial shipment of waste or treatment residue of a restricted waste to the land disposal facility. The certification must state:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the treatment technology and operation of the treatment process used to support this certification. Based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining this information, I believe that the treatment process has been operated and maintained properly so as to comply with the treatment standards specified in 40 CFR 268.40 without impermissible dilution of the prohibited waste. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              A certification is also necessary for contaminated soil and it must state:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the treatment technology and operation of the treatment process used to support this certification and believe that it has been maintained and operated properly so as to comply with treatment standards specified in 40 CFR 268.49 without impermissible dilution of the prohibited wastes. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (i) A copy of the certification must be placed in the treatment facility's on-site files. If the waste or treatment residue changes, or the receiving facility changes, a new certification must be sent to the receiving facility, and a copy placed in the file.

              (ii) Debris excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under § 261.3(f) of this chapter (i.e., debris treated by an extraction or destruction technology provided by Table 1, § 268.45, and debris that the Director has determined does not contain hazardous waste), however, is subject to the notification and certification requirements of paragraph (d) of this section rather than the certification requirements of this paragraph.

              (iii) For wastes with organic constituents having treatment standards expressed as concentration levels, if compliance with the treatment standards is based in whole or in part on the analytical detection limit alternative specified in § 268.40(d), the certification, signed by an authorized representative, must state the following:
              
              
                
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the treatment technology and operation of the treatment process used to support this certification. Based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining this information, I believe that the nonwastewater organic constituents have been treated by combustion units as specified in 268.42, Table 1. I have been unable to detect the nonwastewater organic constituents, despite having used best good-faith efforts to analyze for such constituents. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              

              (iv) For characteristic wastes that are subject to the treatment standards in § 268.40 (other than those expressed as a method of treatment), or § 268.49, and that contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined in § 268.2(i); if these wastes are treated on-site to remove the hazardous characteristic; and are then sent off-site for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, the certification must state the following:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 or 268.49 to remove the hazardous characteristic. This decharacterized waste contains underlying hazardous constituents that require further treatment to meet treatment standards. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              

              (v) For characteristic wastes that contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined § 268.2(i) that are treated on-site to remove the hazardous characteristic to treat underlying hazardous constituents to levels in § 268.48 Universal Treatment Standards, the certification must state the following:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 to remove the hazardous characteristic and that underlying hazardous constituents, as defined in § 268.2(i) have been treated on-site to meet the § 268.48 Universal Treatment Standards. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (5) If the waste or treatment residue will be further managed at a different treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the treatment, storage, or disposal facility sending the waste or treatment residue off-site must comply with the notice and certification requirements applicable to generators under this section.

              (6) Where the wastes are recyclable materials used in a manner constituting disposal subject to the provisions of § 266.20(b) of this chapter regarding treatment standards and prohibition levels, the owner or operator of a treatment facility (i.e., the recycler) must, for the initial shipment of waste, prepare a one-time certification described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and a one-time notice which includes the information in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (except the manifest number). The certification and notification must be placed in the facility's on-site files. If the waste or the receiving facility changes, a new certification and notification must be prepared and placed in the on site files. In addition, the recycling facility must also keep records of the name and location of each entity receiving the hazardous waste-derived product.
              (c) Except where the owner or operator is disposing of any waste that is a recyclable material used in a manner constituting disposal pursuant to 40 CFR 266.20(b), the owner or operator of any land disposal facility disposing any waste subject to restrictions under this part must:
              (1) Have copies of the notice and certifications specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

              § 268.9
              Special rules regarding wastes that exhibit a characteristic.

              (a) The initial generator of a solid waste must determine each EPA Hazardous Waste Number (waste code) applicable to the waste in order to determine the applicable treatment standards under subpart D of this part. This determination may be made concurrently with the hazardous waste determination required in § 262.11 of this chapter. For purposes of part 268, the waste will carry the waste code for any applicable listed waste (40 CFR part 261, subpart D). In addition, where the waste exhibits a characteristic, the waste will carry one or more of the characteristic waste codes (40 CFR part 261, subpart C), except when the treatment standard for the listed waste operates in lieu of the treatment standard for the characteristic waste, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If the generator determines that their waste displays a hazardous characteristic (and is not D001 nonwastewaters treated by CMBST, RORGS, OR POLYM of § 268.42, Table 1), the generator must determine the underlying hazardous constituents (as defined at § 268.2(i)) in the characteristic waste.
              (b) Where a prohibited waste is both listed under 40 CFR part 261, subpart D and exhibits a characteristic under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, the treatment standard for the waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D will operate in lieu of the standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, provided that the treatment standard for the listed waste includes a treatment standard for the constituent that causes the waste to exhibit the characteristic. Otherwise, the waste must meet the treatment standards for all applicable listed and characteristic waste codes.
              (c) In addition to any applicable standards determined from the initial point of generation, no prohibited waste which exhibits a characteristic under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C may be land disposed unless the waste complies with the treatment standards under subpart D of this part.
              (d) Wastes that exhibit a characteristic are also subject to § 268.7 requirements, except that once the waste is no longer hazardous, a one-time notification and certification must be placed in the generator's or treater's on-site files. The notification and certification must be updated if the process or operation generating the waste changes and/or if the subtitle D facility receiving the waste changes.
              (1) The notification must include the following information:
              (i) Name and address of the RCRA Subtitle D facility receiving the waste shipment; and
              (ii) A description of the waste as initially generated, including the applicable EPA hazardous waste code(s), treatability group(s), and underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in § 268.2(i)), unless the waste will be treated and monitored for all underlying hazardous constituents. If all underlying hazardous constituents will be treated and monitored, there is no requirement to list any of the underlying hazardous constituents on the notice.
              (2) The certification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state the language found in § 268.7(b)(4).
              (i) If treatment removes the characteristic but does not meet standards applicable to underlying hazardous constituents, then the certification found in § 268.7(b)(4)(iv) applies.

              § 268.40
              Applicability of treatment standards.
              (a) A prohibited waste identified in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” may be land disposed only if it meets the requirements found in the table. For each waste, the table identifies one of three types of treatment standard requirements:
              (1) All hazardous constituents in the waste or in the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table for that waste (“total waste standards”); or
              (2) The hazardous constituents in the extract of the waste or in the extract of the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table (“waste extract standards”); or
              (3) The waste must be treated using the technology specified in the table (“technology standard”), which are described in detail in § 268.42, Table 1—Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based Standards.
              (b) For wastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for D004 through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment standards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on grab sampling. For wastes covered by the waste extract standards, the test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for D004 and D008, for which either of two test methods may be used: Method 1311, or Method 1310B, the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test. For wastes covered by a technology standard, the wastes may be land disposed after being treated using that specified technology or an equivalent treatment technology approved by the Administrator under the procedures set forth in § 268.42(b).

              (c) When wastes with differing treatment standards for a constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, the treatment residue must meet the lowest treatment standard for the constituent of concern.
              (d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions specified in paragraph (a) of this section, treatment and disposal facilities may demonstrate (and certify pursuant to 40 CFR 268.7(b)(5)) compliance with the treatment standards for organic constituents specified by a footnote in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, provided the following conditions are satisfied:
              (1) The treatment standards for the organic constituents were established based on incineration in units operated in accordance with the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or based on combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with applicable technical requirements;
              (2) The treatment or disposal facility has used the methods referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to treat the organic constituents; and
              (3) The treatment or disposal facility may demonstrate compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical efforts achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that do not exceed the treatment standards specified in this section by an order of magnitude.
              (e) For characteristic wastes (D001-D043) that are subject to treatment standards in the following table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes,” and are not managed in a wastewater treatment system that is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), that is CWA-equivalent, or that is injected into a Class I nonhazardous deep injection well, all underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in § 268.2(i)) must meet Universal Treatment Standards, found in § 268.48, Table Universal Treatment Standards, prior to land disposal as defined in § 268.2(c) of this part.
              (f) The treatment standards for F001-F005 nonwastewater constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to wastes which contain only one, two, or three of these constituents. Compliance is measured for these constituents in the waste extract from test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods”, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along with any of the other 25 constituents found in F001-F005, then compliance with treatment standards for carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not required.
              (g) Between August 26, 1996 and March 4, 1999 the treatment standards for the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.32 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers K156-K161; and in 40 CFR 261.33 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers P127, P128, P185, P188-P192, P194, P196-P199, P201-P205, U271, U277-U280, U364-U367, U372, U373, U375-U379, U381-U387, U389-U396, U400-U404, U407, and U409-U411; and soil contaminated with these wastes; may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent concentrations presented in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, or by treating the waste by the following technologies: combustion, as defined by the technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as defined by the technology code CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the technology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1, for wastewaters.
              (h) Prohibited D004-D011 mixed radioactive wastes and mixed radioactive listed wastes containing metal constituents, that were previously treated by stabilization to the treatment standards in effect at that time and then put into storage, do not have to be re-treated to meet treatment standards in this section prior to land disposal.
              (i) [Reserved]

              (j) Effective September 4, 1998, the treatment standards for the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.33 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers P185, P191, P192, P197, U364, U394, and U395 may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent concentrations presented in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, or by treating the waste by the following technologies: combustion, as defined by the technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1 of this Part, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as defined by the technology code CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the technology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1 of this Part, for wastewaters.

                Note 1: When a combination of these technologies (i.e., a treatment train) is specified as a single treatment standard, the order of application is specified in § 268.42, Table 2 by indicating the five letter technology code that must be applied first, then the designation “fb.” (an abbreviation for “followed by”), then the five letter technology code for the technology that must be applied next, and so on.

                Note 2: When more than one technology (or treatment train) are specified as alternative treatment standards, the five letter technology codes (or the treatment trains) are separated by a semicolon (;) with the last technology preceded by the word “OR”. This indicates that any one of these BDAT technologies or treatment trains can be used for compliance with the standard.
              
              (b) Any person may submit an application to the Administrator demonstrating that an alternative treatment method can achieve a measure of performance equivalent to that achieved by methods specified in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section for wastes or specified in Table 1 of § 268.45 for hazardous debris. The applicant must submit information demonstrating that his treatment method is in compliance with federal, state, and local requirements and is protective of human health and the environment. On the basis of such information and any other available information, the Administrator may approve the use of the alternative treatment method if he finds that the alternative treatment method provides a measure of performance equivalent to that achieved by methods specified in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section for wastes or in Table 1 of § 268.45 for hazardous debris. Any approval must be stated in writing and may contain such provisions and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate. The person to whom such approval is issued must comply with all limitations contained in such a determination.
              (c) As an alternative to the otherwise applicable subpart D treatment standards, lab packs are eligible for land disposal provided the following requirements are met:
              (1) The lab packs comply with the applicable provisions of 40 CFR 264.316 and 40 CFR 265.316;
              (2) The lab pack does not contain any of the wastes listed in Appendix IV to part 268;
              (3) The lab packs are incinerated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O or 40 CFR part 265, subpart O; and
              (4) Any incinerator residues from lab packs containing D004, D005, D006, D007, D008, D010, and D011 are treated in compliance with the applicable treatment standards specified for such wastes in subpart D of this part.
              (d) Radioactive hazardous mixed wastes are subject to the treatment standards in § 268.40. Where treatment standards are specified for radioactive mixed wastes in the Table of Treatment Standards, those treatment standards will govern. Where there is no specific treatment standard for radioactive mixed waste, the treatment standard for the hazardous waste (as designated by EPA waste code) applies. Hazardous debris containing radioactive waste is subject to the treatment standards specified in § 268.45.

              § 268.44
              Variance from a treatment standard.

              (a) Based on a petition filed by a generator or treater of hazardous waste, the Administrator may approve a variance from an applicable treatment standard if:
              
              (1) It is not physically possible to treat the waste to the level specified in the treatment standard, or by the method specified as the treatment standard. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must demonstrate that because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ significantly from waste analyzed in developing the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to the specified level or by the specified method; or
              (2) It is inappropriate to require the waste to be treated to the level specified in the treatment standard or by the method specified as the treatment standard, even though such treatment is technically possible. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must either demonstrate that:
              (i) Treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is technically inappropriate (for example, resulting in combustion of large amounts of mildly contaminated environmental media); or
              (ii) For remediation waste only, treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is environmentally inappropriate because it would likely discourage aggressive remediation.
              (b) Each petition must be submitted in accordance with the procedures in § 260.20.

              (c) Each petition must include the following statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
              
              
              (d) After receiving a petition for variance from a treatment standard, the Administrator may request any additional information or samples which he may require to evaluate the petition. Additional copies of the complete petition may be requested as needed to send to affected states and Regional Offices.
              (e) The Administrator will give public notice in the Federal Register of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a variance from a treatment standard will be published in the Federal Register.
              
              (f) A generator, treatment facility, or disposal facility that is managing a waste covered by a variance from the treatment standards must comply with the waste analysis requirements for restricted wastes found under § 268.7.
              (g) During the petition review process, the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.
              (h) Based on a petition filed by a generator or treater of hazardous waste, the Administrator or his or her delegated representative may approve a site-specific variance from an applicable treatment standard if:
              (1) It is not physically possible to treat the waste to the level specified in the treatment standard, or by the method specified as the treatment standard. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must demonstrate that because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ significantly from waste analyzed in developing the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to the specified level or by the specified method; or
              (2) It is inappropriate to require the waste to be treated to the level specified in the treatment standard or by the method specified as the treatment standard, even though such treatment is technically possible. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must either demonstrate that:
              (i) Treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is technically inappropriate (for example, resulting in combustion of large amounts of mildly contaminated environmental media where the treatment standard is not based on combustion of such media); or

              (ii) For remediation waste only, treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is environmentally inappropriate because it would likely discourage aggressive remediation.
              

              (3) For contaminated soil only, treatment to the level or by the method specified in the soil treatment standards would result in concentrations of hazardous constituents that are below (i.e., lower than) the concentrations necessary to minimize short- and long-term threats to human health and the environment. Treatment variances approved under this paragraph must:
              (i) At a minimum, impose alternative land disposal restriction treatment standards that, using a reasonable maximum exposure scenario:

              (A) For carcinogens, achieve constituent concentrations that result in the total excess risk to an individual exposed over a lifetime generally falling within a range from 10 −4 to 10 −6; and
              (B) For constituents with non-carcinogenic effects, achieve constituent concentrations that an individual could be exposed to on a daily basis without appreciable risk of deleterious effect during a lifetime.
              (ii) Not consider post-land-disposal controls.

              (4) For contaminated soil only, treatment to the level or by the method specified in the soil treatment standards would result in concentrations of hazardous constituents that are below (i.e., lower than) natural background concentrations at the site where the contaminated soil will land disposed.
              (5) Public notice and a reasonable opportunity for public comment must be provided before granting or denying a petition.
              (i) Each application for a site-specific variance from a treatment standard must include the information in § 260.20(b)(1)-(4);
              (j) After receiving an application for a site-specific variance from a treatment standard, the Assistant Administrator, or his delegated representative, may request any additional information or samples which may be required to evaluate the application.
              (k) A generator, treatment facility, or disposal facility that is managing a waste covered by a site-specific variance from a treatment standard must comply with the waste analysis requirements for restricted wastes found under § 268.7.
              (l) During the application review process, the applicant for a site-specific variance must comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.
              (m) For all variances, the petitioner must also demonstrate that compliance with any given treatment variance is sufficient to minimize threats to human health and the environment posed by land disposal of the waste. In evaluating this demonstration, EPA may take into account whether a treatment variance should be approved if the subject waste is to be used in a manner constituting disposal pursuant to 40 CFR 266.20 through 266.23.

              § 268.45
              Treatment standards for hazardous debris.
              (a) Treatment standards. Hazardous debris must be treated prior to land disposal as follows unless EPA determines under § 261.3(f)(2) of this chapter that the debris is no longer contaminated with hazardous waste or the debris is treated to the waste-specific treatment standard provided in this subpart for the waste contaminating the debris:
              (1) General. Hazardous debris must be treated for each “contaminant subject to treatment” defined by paragraph (b) of this section using the technology or technologies identified in Table 1 of this section.
              (2) Characteristic debris. Hazardous debris that exhibits the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity identified under §§ 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23 of this chapter, respectively, must be deactivated by treatment using one of the technologies identified in Table 1 of this section.
              (3) Mixtures of debris types. The treatment standards of Table 1 in this section must be achieved for each type of debris contained in a mixture of debris types. If an immobilization technology is used in a treatment train, it must be the last treatment technology used.
              (4) Mixtures of contaminant types. Debris that is contaminated with two or more contaminants subject to treatment identified under paragraph (b) of this section must be treated for each contaminant using one or more treatment technologies identified in Table 1 of this section. If an immobilization technology is used in a treatment train, it must be the last treatment technology used.
              (5) Waste PCBs. Hazardous debris that is also a waste PCB under 40 CFR part 761 is subject to the requirements of either 40 CFR part 761 or the requirements of this section, whichever are more stringent.
              (b) Contaminants subject to treatment. Hazardous debris must be treated for each “contaminant subject to treatment.” The contaminants subject to treatment must be determined as follows:
              (1) Toxicity characteristic debris. The contaminants subject to treatment for debris that exhibits the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) by § 261.24 of this chapter are those EP constituents for which the debris exhibits the TC toxicity characteristic.
              (2) Debris contaminated with listed waste. The contaminants subject to treatment for debris that is contaminated with a prohibited listed hazardous waste are those constituents or wastes for which treatment standards are established for the waste under § 268.40.
              (3) Cyanide reactive debris. Hazardous debris that is reactive because of cyanide must be treated for cyanide.
              (c) Conditioned exclusion of treated debris. Hazardous debris that has been treated using one of the specified extraction or destruction technologies in Table 1 of this section and that does not exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste identified under subpart C, part 261, of this chapter after treatment is not a hazardous waste and need not be managed in a subtitle C facility. Hazardous debris contaminated with a listed waste that is treated by an immobilization technology specified in Table 1 is a hazardous waste and must be managed in a subtitle C facility.
              (d) Treatment residuals—(1) General requirements. Except as provided by paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(4) of this section:

              (i) Residue from the treatment of hazardous debris must be separated from the treated debris using simple physical or mechanical means; and
              
              (ii) Residue from the treatment of hazardous debris is subject to the waste-specific treatment standards provided by subpart D of this part for the waste contaminating the debris.
              (2) Nontoxic debris. Residue from the deactivation of ignitable, corrosive, or reactive characteristic hazardous debris (other than cyanide-reactive) that is not contaminated with a contaminant subject to treatment defined by paragraph (b) of this section, must be deactivated prior to land disposal and is not subject to the waste-specific treatment standards of subpart D of this part.
              (3) Cyanide-reactive debris. Residue from the treatment of debris that is reactive because of cyanide must meet the treatment standards for D003 in “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” at § 268.40.
              (4) Ignitable nonwastewater residue. Ignitable nonwastewaster residue containing equal to or greater than 10% total organic carbon is subject to the technology specified in the treatment standard for D001: Ignitable Liquids.
              (5) Residue from spalling. Layers of debris removed by spalling are hazardous debris that remain subject to the treatment standards of this section.

                  Same as above.
                
                
                  3. Thermal Destruction: Treatment in an incinerator operating in accordance with Subpart O of Parts 264 or 265 of this chapter; a boiler or industrial furnace operating in accordance with Subpart H of Part 266 of this chapter, or other thermal treatment unit operated in accordance with Subpart X, Part 264 of this chapter, or Subpart P, Part 265 of this chapter, but excluding for purposes of these debris treatment standards Thermal Desorption units
                  Treated debris must be separated from treatment residuals using simple physical or mechanical means,9 and, prior to further treatment, such residue must meet the waste-specific treatment standards for organic compounds in the waste contaminating the debris
                  
                    Brick, Concrete, Glass, Metal, Pavement, Rock, Metal: Metals other than mercury, except that there are no metal restrictions for vitrification.
                      Debris contaminated with a dioxin-listed waste.
                      6 Obtain an “Equivalent Technology” approval under § 268.42(b),8 except that this requirement does not apply to vitrification.
                  
                
                
                  C. Immobilization Technologies:
                
                
                  1. Macroencapsulation: Application of surface coating materials such as polymeric organics (e.g., resins and plastics) or use of a jacket of inert inorganic materials to substantially reduce surface exposure to potential leaching media
                  Encapsulating material must completely encapsulate debris and be resistant to degradation by the debris and its contaminants and materials into which it may come into contact after placement (leachate, other waste, microbes)
                  None.
                
                
                  2. Microencapsulation: Stabilization of the debris with the following reagents (or waste reagents) such that the leachability of the hazardous contaminants is reduced: (1) Portland cement; or (2) lime/pozzolans (e.g., fly ash and cement kiln dust). Reagents (e.g., iron salts, silicates, and clays) may be added to enhance the set/cure time and/or compressive strength, or to reduce the leachability of the hazardous constituents.5
                  
                  Leachability of the hazardous contaminants must be reduced
                  None.
                
                
                  
                  3. Sealing: Application of an appropriate material which adheres tightly to the debris surface to avoid exposure of the surface to potential leaching media. When necessary to effectively seal the surface, sealing entails pretreatment of the debris surface to remove foreign matter and to clean and roughen the surface. Sealing materials include epoxy, silicone, and urethane compounds, but paint may not be used as a sealant
                  Sealing must avoid exposure of the debris surface to potential leaching media and sealant must be resistent to degradation by the debris and its contaminants and materials into which it may come into contact after placement (leachate, other waste, microbes)
                  None.
                
                
                  1 Hazardous debris must be treated by either these standards or the waste-specific treatment standards for the waste contaminating the debris. The treatment standards must be met for each type of debris contained in a mixture of debris types, unless the debris is converted into treatment residue as a result of the treatment process. Debris treatment residuals are subject to the waste-specific treatment standards for the waste contaminating the debris.
                
                  2 Contaminant restriction means that the technology is not BDAT for that contaminant. If debris containing a restricted contaminant is treated by the technology, the contaminant must be subsequently treated by a technology for which it is not restricted in order to be land disposed (and excluded from Subtitle C regulation).
                
                  3 “Clean debris surface” means the surface, when viewed without magnification, shall be free of all visible contaminated soil and hazardous waste except that residual staining from soil and waste consisting of light shadows, slight streaks, or minor discolorations, and soil and waste in cracks, crevices, and pits may be present provided that such staining and waste and soil in cracks, crevices, and pits shall be limited to no more than 5% of each square inch of surface area.
                
                  4 Acids, solvents, and chemical reagents may react with some debris and contaminants to form hazardous compounds. For example, acid washing of cyanide-contaminated debris could result in the formation of hydrogen cyanide. Some acids may also react violently with some debris and contaminants, depending on the concentration of the acid and the type of debris and contaminants. Debris treaters should refer to the safety precautions specified in Material Safety Data Sheets for various acids to avoid applying an incompatible acid to a particular debris/contaminant combination. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid may react violently with certain organic compounds, such as acrylonitrile.
                
                  5 If reducing the particle size of debris to meet the treatment standards results in material that no longer meets the 60 mm minimum particle size limit for debris, such material is subject to the waste-specific treatment standards for the waste contaminating the material, unless the debris has been cleaned and separated from contaminated soil and waste prior to size reduction. At a minimum, simple physical or mechanical means must be used to provide such cleaning and separation of nondebris materials to ensure that the debris surface is free of caked soil, waste, or other nondebris material.
                
                  6 Dioxin-listed wastes are EPA Hazardous Waste numbers FO20, FO21, FO22, FO23, FO26, and FO27.
                
                  7 Thermal desorption is distinguished from Thermal Destruction in that the primary purpose of Thermal Desorption is to volatilize contaminants and to remove them from the treatment chamber for subsequent destruction or other treatment.
                
                  8 The demonstration “Equivalent Technology” under § 268.42(b) must document that the technology treats contaminants subject to treatment to a level equivalent to that required by the performance and design and operating standards for other technologies in this table such that residual levels of hazardous contaminants will not pose a hazard to human health and the environment absent management controls.
                
                  9 Any soil, waste, and other nondebris material that remains on the debris surface (or remains mixed with the debris) after treatment is considered a treatment residual that must be separated from the debris using, at a minimum, simple physical or mechanical means. Examples of simple physical or mechanical means are vibratory or trommel screening or water washing. The debris surface need not be cleaned to a “clean debris surface” as defined in note 3 when separating treated debris from residue; rather, the surface must be free of caked soil, waste, or other nondebris material. Treatment residuals are subject to the waste-specific treatment standards for the waste contaminating the debris.

                  Except for Metals (EP or TCLP) and Cyanides (Total and Amenable) the nonwastewater treatment standards expressed as a concentration were established, inpart, based upon incineration in units operated in accordance with the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O or 40 CFR part 265, subpart O, or based upon combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with applicable technical requirements. A facility may comply with these treatment standards according to provisions in 40 CFR 268.40(d). All concentration standards for nonwastewaters are based on analysis of grab samples.

              Alternative LDR treatment standards for contaminated soil.
              (a) Applicability. You must comply with LDRs prior to placing soil that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste, or exhibited a characteristic of hazardous waste at the time it was generated, into a land disposal unit. The following chart describes whether you must comply with LDRs prior to placing soil contaminated by listed hazardous waste into a land disposal unit:
              
                
                  If LDRs
                  And if LDRs

                  Must comply with LDRs
                
                
                  Didn't apply to the listed waste when it contaminated the soil*
                  Apply to the listed waste now
                  The soil is determined to contain the listed waste when the soil is first generated
                  Must comply with LDRs.
                
                
                  Didn't apply to the listed waste when it contaminated the soil*
                  Apply to the listed waste now
                  The soil is determined not to contain the listed waste when the soil is first generated
                  Needn't comply with LDRs.
                
                
                  Didn't apply to the listed waste when it contaminated the soil*
                  Don't apply to the listed waste now
                  
                  Needn't comply with LDRs.
                
                * For dates of LDR applicability, see 40 CFR Part 268 Appendix VII. To determine the date any given listed hazardous waste contaminated any given volume of soil, use the last date any given listed hazardous waste was placed into any given land disposal unit or, in the case of an accidental spill, the date of the spill.
              
              (b) Prior to land disposal, contaminated soil identified by paragraph (a) of this section as needing to comply with LDRs must be treated according to the applicable treatment standards specified in paragraph (c) of this section or according to the Universal Treatment Standards specified in 40 CFR 268.48 applicable to the contaminating listed hazardous waste and/or the applicable characteristic of hazardous waste if the soil is characteristic. The treatment standards specified in paragraph (c) of this section and the Universal Treatment Standards may be modified through a treatment variance approved in accordance with 40 CFR 268.44.
              (c) Treatment standards for contaminated soils. Prior to land disposal, contaminated soil identified by paragraph (a) of this section as needing to comply with LDRs must be treated according to all the standards specified in this paragraph or according to the Universal Treatment Standards specified in 40 CFR 268.48.
              
              (1) All soils. Prior to land disposal, all constituents subject to treatment must be treated as follows:
              (A) For non-metals except carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and methanol, treatment must achieve 90 percent reduction in total constituent concentrations, except as provided by paragraph (c)(1)(C) of this section.
              (B) For metals and carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and methanol, treatment must achieve 90 percent reduction in constituent concentrations as measured in leachate from the treated media (tested according to the TCLP) or 90 percent reduction in total constituent concentrations (when a metal removal treatment technology is used), except as provided by paragraph (c)(1)(C)of this section.
              (C) When treatment of any constituent subject to treatment to a 90 percent reduction standard would result in a concentration less than 10 times the Universal Treatment Standard for that constituent, treatment to achieve constituent concentrations less than 10 times the universal treatment standard is not required. Universal Treatment Standards are identified in 40 CFR 268.48 Table UTS.
              (2) Soils that exhibit the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity or reactivity. In addition to the treatment required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, prior to land disposal, soils that exhibit the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity must be treated to eliminate these characteristics.
              (3) Soils that contain nonanalyzable constituents. In addition to the treatment requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, prior to land disposal, the following treatment is required for soils that contain nonanalyzable constituents:
              (A) For soil that contains only analyzable and nonanalyzable organic constituents, treatment of the analyzable organic constituents to the levels specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section; or,
              (B) For soil that contains only nonanalyzable constituents, treatment by the method(s) specified in § 268.42 for the waste contained in the soil.
              (d) Constituents subject to treatment. When applying the soil treatment standards in paragraph (c) of this section, constituents subject to treatment are any constituents listed in § 268.48 Table UTS-Universal Treatment Standards that are reasonably expected to be present in any given volume of contaminated soil, except fluoride, selenium, sulfides, vanadium, zinc, and that are present at concentrations greater than ten times the universal treatment standard. PCBs are not constituent subject to treatment in any given volume of soil which exhibits the toxicity characteristic solely because of the presence of metals.
              (e) Management of treatment residuals. Treatment residuals from treating contaminated soil identified by paragraph (a) of this section as needing to comply with LDRs must be managed as follows:
              (1) Soil residuals are subject to the treatment standards of this section;
              (2) Non-soil residuals are subject to:
              (A) For soils contaminated by listed hazardous waste, the RCRA Subtitle C standards applicable to the listed hazardous waste; and
              (B) For soils that exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste, if the non-soil residual also exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste, the treatment standards applicable to the characteristic hazardous waste.

              § 268.50
              Prohibitions on storage of restricted wastes.
              (a) Except as provided in this section, the storage of hazardous wastes restricted from land disposal under subpart C of this part of RCRA section 3004 is prohibited, unless the following conditions are met:

              (1) A generator stores such wastes in tanks, containers, or containment buildings on-site solely for the purpose of the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal and the generator complies with the requirements in §§ 262.16 and 262.17 and parts 264 and 265 of this chapter.
              
              (2) An owner/operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility stores such wastes in tanks, containers, or containment buildings solely for the purpose of the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal and:
              (i) Each container is clearly marked to identify its contents and with:
              (A) The words “Hazardous Waste”;
              (B) The applicable EPA hazardous waste number(s) (EPA hazardous waste codes) in subparts C and D of part 261 of this chapter; or use a nationally recognized electronic system, such as bar coding, to identify the EPA hazardous waste number(s);

              (C) An indication of the hazards of the contents (examples include, but are not limited to, the applicable hazardous waste characteristic(s) (i.e., ignitable, corrosive, reactive, toxic); hazard communication consistent with the Department of Transportation requirements at 49 CFR part 172 subpart E (labeling) or subpart F (placarding); a hazard statement or pictogram consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard at 29 CFR 1910.1200; or a chemical hazard label consistent with the National Fire Protection Association code 704); and
              (D) The date each period of accumulation begins.
              (ii) Each tank is clearly marked with a description of its contents, the quantity of each hazardous waste received, and the date each period of accumulation begins, or such information for each tank is recorded and maintained in the operating record at that facility. Regardless of whether the tank itself is marked, an owner/operator must comply with the operating record requirements specified in § 264.73 or § 265.73.
              (3) A transporter stores manifested shipments of such wastes at a transfer facility for 10 days or less.
              (b) An owner/operator of a treatment, storage or disposal facility may store such wastes for up to one year unless the Agency can demonstrate that such storage was not solely for the purpose of accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal.
              (c) An owner/operator of a treatment, storage or disposal facility may store such wastes beyond one year; however, the owner/operator bears the burden of proving that such storage was solely for the purpose of accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal.
              (d) If a generator's waste is exempt from a prohibition on the type of land disposal utilized for the waste (for example, because of an approved case-by-case extension under § 268.5, an approved § 268.6 petition, or a national capacity variance under subpart C), the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply during the period of such exemption.
              (e) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to hazardous wastes that meet the treatment standards specified under §§ 268.41, 268.42, and 268.43 or the treatment standards specified under the variance in § 268.44, or, where treatment standards have not been specified, is in compliance with the applicable prohibitions specified in § 268.32 or RCRA section 3004.
              (f) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm must be stored at a facility that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 761.65(b) and must be removed from storage and treated or disposed as required by this part within one year of the date when such wastes are first placed into storage. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to such PCB wastes prohibited under § 268.32 of this part.
              (g) The prohibition and requirements in this section do not apply to hazardous remediation wastes stored in a staging pile approved pursuant to § 264.554 of this chapter.

              Appendix VI to Part 268—Recommended Technologies To Achieve Deactivation of Characteristics in Section 268.42
              The treatment standard for many characteristic wastes is stated in the § 268.40 Table of Treatment Standards as “Deactivation and meet UTS.” EPA has determined that many technologies, when used alone or in combination, can achieve the deactivation portion of the treatment standard. Characteristic wastes that are not managed in a facility regulated by the Clean Water Act (CWA) or in a CWA-equivalent facility, and that also contain underlying hazardous constituents (see § 268.2(i)) must be treated not only by a “deactivating” technology to remove the characteristic, but also to achieve the universal treatment standards (UTS) for underlying hazardous constituents. The following appendix presents a partial list of technologies, utilizing the five letter technology codes established in 40 CFR 268.42 Table 1, that may be useful in meeting the treatment standard. Use of these specific technologies is not mandatory and does not preclude direct reuse, recovery, and/or the use of other pretreatment technologies, provided deactivation is achieved and underlying hazardous constituents are treated to achieve the UTS.

              § 270.1
              Purpose and scope of these regulations.
              (a) Coverage. (1) These permit regulations establish provisions for the Hazardous Waste Permit Program under Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), (Pub. L. 94-580, as amended by Pub. L. 95-609 and by Pub. L. 96-482; 42 U.S.C. 6091 et seq.). They apply to EPA and to approved States to the extent provided in part 271.
              (2) The regulations in this part cover basic EPA permitting requirements, such as application requirements, standard permit conditions, and monitoring and reporting requirements. These regulations are part of a regulatory scheme implementing RCRA set forth in different parts of the Code of Federal Regulations. The following chart indicates where the regulations implementing RCRA appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              (3) Technical regulations. The RCRA permit program has separate additional regulations that contain technical requirements. These separate regulations are used by permit issuing authorities to determine what requirements must be placed in permits if they are issued. These separate regulations are located in 40 CFR parts 264, 266, 267, and 268.
              (b) Overview of the RCRA Permit Program. Not later than 90 days after the promulgation or revision of regulations in 40 CFR part 261 (identifying and listing hazardous wastes) generators and transporters of hazardous waste, and owners or operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities may be required to file a notification of that activity under section 3010. Six months after the initial promulgation of the part 261 regulations, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste by any person who has not applied for or received a RCRA permit is prohibited. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDs) that are otherwise subject to permitting under RCRA and that meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1), or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may be eligible for a standardized permit under subpart J of this part. A RCRA permit application consists of two parts, part A (see § 270.13) and part B (see § 270.14 and applicable sections in §§ 270.15 through 270.29). For “existing HWM facilities,” the requirement to submit an application is satisfied by submitting only part A of the permit application until the date the Director sets for submitting part B of the application. (Part A consists of Forms 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Permit Application Forms.) Timely submission of both notification under section 3010 and part A qualifies owners and operators of existing HWM facilities (who are required to have a permit) for interim status under section 3005(e) of RCRA. Facility owners and operators with interim status are treated as having been issued a permit until EPA or a State with interim authorization for Phase II or final authorization under part 271 makes a final determination on the permit application. Facility owners and operators with interim status must comply with interim status standards set forth at 40 CFR part 265 and 266 or with the analogous provisions of a State program which has received interim or final authorization under part 271. Facility owners and operators with interim status are not relieved from complying with other State requirements. For existing HWM facilities, the Director shall set a date, giving at least six months notice, for submission of part B of the application. There is no form for part B of the application; rather, part B must be submitted in narrative form and contain the information set forth in the applicable sections of §§ 270.14 through 270.29. Owners or operators of new HWM facilities must submit parts A and B of the permit application at least 180 days before physical construction is expected to commence.
              (1) The facility generates hazardous waste and then non-thermally treats or stores hazardous waste on-site in tanks, containers, or containment buildings; or
              (2) The facility receives hazardous waste generated off-site by a generator under the same ownership as the receiving facility, and then stores or non-thermally treats the hazardous waste in containers, tanks, or containment buildings.
              (c) Scope of the RCRA permit requirement. RCRA requires a permit for the “treatment,” “storage,” and “disposal” of any “hazardous waste” as identified or listed in 40 CFR part 261. The terms “treatment,” “storage,” “disposal,” and “hazardous waste” are defined in § 270.2. Owners and operators of hazardous waste management units must have permits during the active life (including the closure period) of the unit. Owners and operators of surface impoundments, landfills, land treatment units, and waste pile units that received waste after July 26, 1982, or that certified closure (according to § 265.115 of this chapter) after January 26, 1983, must have post-closure permits, unless they demonstrate closure by removal or decontamination as provided under § 270.1(c)(5) and (6), or obtain an enforceable document in lieu of a post-closure permit, as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. If a post-closure permit is required, the permit must address applicable 40 CFR part 264 groundwater monitoring, unsaturated zone monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care requirements of this chapter. The denial of a permit for the active life of a hazardous waste management facility or unit does not affect the requirement to obtain a post-closure permit under this section.
              (1) Specific inclusions. Owners and operators of certain facilities require RCRA permits as well as permits under other programs for certain aspects of the facility operation. RCRA permits are required for:
              (i) Injection wells that dispose of hazardous waste, and associated surface facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste, (See § 270.64). However, the owner and operator with a UIC permit in a State with an approved or promulgated UIC program, will be deemed to have a RCRA permit for the injection well itself if they comply with the requirements of § 270.60(b) (permit-by-rule for injection wells).
              (ii) Treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste at facilities requiring an NPDES permit. However, the owner and operator of a publicly owned treatment works receiving hazardous waste will be deemed to have a RCRA permit for that waste if they comply with the requirements of § 270.60(c) (permit-by-rule for POTWs).
              (iii) Barges or vessels that dispose of hazardous waste by ocean disposal and onshore hazardous waste treatment or storage facilities associated with an ocean disposal operation. However, the owner and operator will be deemed to have a RCRA permit for ocean disposal from the barge or vessel itself if they comply with the requirements of § 270.60(a) (permit-by-rule for ocean disposal barges and vessels).
              (2) Specific exclusions and exemptions. The following persons are among those who are not required to obtain a RCRA permit:
              
              (i) Generators who accumulate hazardous waste on site in compliance with all of the conditions for exemption provided in 40 CFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17.
              (ii) Farmers who dispose of hazardous waste pesticides from their own use as provided in § 262.70 of this chapter;
              (iii) Persons who own or operate facilities solely for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste excluded from regulations under this part by 40 CFR 261.4 or 262.14 (very small quantity generator exemption).
              (iv) Owners or operators of totally enclosed treatment facilities as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.
              (v) Owners and operators of elementary neutralization units or wastewater treatment units as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.
              (vi) Transporters storing manifested shipments of hazardous waste in containers meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 262.30 at a transfer facility for a period of ten days or less.
              (vii) Persons adding absorbent material to waste in a container (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) and persons adding waste to absorbent material in a container, provided that these actions occur at the time waste is first placed in the container; and §§ 264.17(b), 264.171, and 264.172 of this chapter are complied with.
              (viii) Universal waste handlers and universal waste transporters (as defined in 40 CFR 260.10) managing the wastes listed below. These handlers are subject to regulation under 40 part CFR 273.
              (A) Batteries as described in 40 CFR 273.2;
              (B) Pesticides as described in § 273.3 of this chapter;
              (C) Mercury-containing equipment as described in § 273.4 of this chapter; and
              (D) Lamps as described in § 273.5 of this chapter.
              (ix) A New York State Utility central collection facility consolidating hazardous waste in accordance with 40 CFR 262.90.
              (3) Further exclusions. (i) A person is not required to obtain a RCRA permit for treatment or containment activities taken during immediate response to any of the following situations:
              (A) A discharge of a hazardous waste;
              (B) An imminent and substantial threat of a discharge of hazardous waste;
              (C) A discharge of a material which, when discharged, becomes a hazardous waste.
              (D) An immediate threat to human health, public safety, property, or the environment from the known or suspected presence of military munitions, other explosive material, or an explosive device, as determined by an explosive or munitions emergency response specialist as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.
              (ii) Any person who continues or initiates hazardous waste treatment or containment activities after the immediate response is over is subject to all applicable requirements of this part for those activities.
              (iii) In the case of emergency responses involving military munitions, the responding military emergency response specialist's organizational unit must retain records for three years identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons responding, the type and description of material addressed, and its disposition.
              (4) Permits for less than an entire facility. EPA may issue or deny a permit for one or more units at a facility without simultaneously issuing or denying a permit to all of the units at the facility. The interim status of any unit for which a permit has not been issued or denied is not affected by the issuance or denial of a permit to any other unit at the facility.
              (5) Closure by removal. Owners/operators of surface impoundments, land treatment units, and waste piles closing by removal or decontamination under part 265 standards must obtain a post-closure permit unless they can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that the closure met the standards for closure by removal or decontamination in § 264.228, § 264.280(e), or § 264.258, respectively. The demonstration may be made in the following ways:

              (i) If the owner/operator has submitted a part B application for a post-closure permit, the owner/operator may request a determination, based on information contained in the application, that section 264 closure by removal standards were met. If the Regional Administrator believes that § 264 standards were met, he/she will notify the public of this proposed decision, allow for public comment, and reach a final determination according to the procedures in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
              (ii) If the owner/operator has not submitted a part B application for a post-closure permit, the owner/operator may petition the Regional Administrator for a determination that a post-closure permit is not required because the closure met the applicable part 264 closure standards.
              (A) The petition must include data demonstrating that closure by removal or decontamination standards were met, or it must demonstrate that the unit closed under State requirements that met or exceeded the applicable 264 closure-by-removal standard.
              (B) The Regional Administrator shall approve or deny the petition according to the procedures outlined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
              (6) Procedures for closure equivalency determination. (i) If a facility owner/operator seeks an equivalency demonstration under § 270.1(c)(5), the Regional Administrator will provide the public, through a newspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the information submitted by the owner/operator within 30 days from the date of the notice. The Regional Administrator will also, in response to a request or at his/her own discretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the equivalence of the part 265 closure to a part 264 closure. The Regional Administrator will give public notice of the hearing at least 30 days before it occurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to submit written comments, and the two notices may be combined.)
              (ii) The Regional Administrator will determine whether the part 265 closure met 264 closure by removal or decontamination requirements within 90 days of its receipt. If the Regional Administrator finds that the closure did not meet the applicable part 264 standards, he/she will provide the owner/operator with a written statement of the reasons why the closure failed to meet part 264 standards. The owner/operator may submit additional information in support of an equivalency demonstration within 30 days after receiving such written statement. The Regional Administrator will review any additional information submitted and make a final determination within 60 days.
              (iii) If the Regional Administrator determines that the facility did not close in accordance with part 264 closure by removal standards, the facility is subject to post-closure permitting requirements.
              (7) Enforceable documents for post-closure care. At the discretion of the Regional Administrator, an owner or operator may obtain, in lieu of a post-closure permit, an enforceable document imposing the requirements of 40 CFR 265.121. “Enforceable document” means an order, a plan, or other document issued by EPA or by an authorized State under an authority that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 271.16(e) including, but not limited to, a corrective action order issued by EPA under section 3008(h), a CERCLA remedial action, or a closure or post-closure plan.

              § 270.2
              Definitions.
              The following definitions apply to parts 270, 271 and 124. Terms not defined in this section have the meaning given by RCRA.
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.
              
                Application means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in approved States, including any approved modifications or revisions. Application also includes the information required by the Director under §§ 270.14 through 270.29 (contents of part B of the RCRA application).
              
                Approved program or approved State means a State which has been approved or authorized by EPA under part 271.
              
                Aquifer means a geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of yielding a significant amount of water to a well or spring.
              
                Closure means the act of securing a Hazardous Waste Management facility pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR part 264.
              
                Component means any constituent part of a unit or any group of constituent parts of a unit which are assembled to perform a specific function (e.g., a pump seal, pump, kiln liner, kiln thermocouple).
              
                Corrective Action Management Unit or CAMU means an area within a facility that is designated by the Regional Administrator under part 264 subpart S, for the purpose of implementing corrective action requirements under § 264.101 and RCRA section 3008(h). A CAMU shall only be used for the management of remediation wastes pursuant to implementing such corrective action requirements at the facility.
              
                CWA means the Clean Water Act (formerly referred to as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972) Pub. L. 92-500, as amended by Pub. L. 92-217 and Pub. L. 95-576; 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.
              
              
                Director means the Regional Administrator or the State Director, as the context requires, or an authorized representative. When there is no approved State program, and there is an EPA administered program, Director means the Regional Administrator. When there is an approved State program, Director normally means the State Director. In some circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain actions even when there is an approved State program. In such cases, the term Director means the Regional Administrator and not the State Director.
              
                Disposal means the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground water.

              § 270.3
              Considerations under Federal law.
              The following is a list of Federal laws that may apply to the issuance of permits under these rules. When any of these laws is applicable, its procedures must be followed. When the applicable law requires consideration or adoption of particular permit conditions or requires the denial of a permit, those requirements also must be followed.
              (a) The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 16 U.S.C. 1273 et seq. Section 7 of the Act prohibits the Regional Administrator from assisting by license or otherwise the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct, adverse effect on the values for which a national wild and scenic river was established.
              (b) The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq. Section 106 of the Act and implementing regulations (36 CFR part 800) require the Regional Administrator, before issuing a license, to adopt measures when feasible to mitigate potential adverse effects of the licensed activity and properties listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The Act's requirements are to be implemented in cooperation with State Historic Preservation Officers and upon notice to, and when appropriate, in consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
              (c) The Endangered Species Act. 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. Section 7 of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR part 402) require the Regional Administrator to ensure, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, that any action authorized by EPA is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or adversely affect its critical habitat.
              (d) The Coastal Zone Management Act. 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq. Section 307(c) of the Act and implementing regulations (15 CFR part 930) prohibit EPA from issuing a permit for an activity affecting land or water use in the coastal zone until the applicant certifies that the proposed activity complies with the State Coastal Zone Management program, and the State or its designated agency concurs with the certification (or the Secretary of Commerce overrides the State's nonconcurrence).
              (e) The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq. requires that the Regional Administrator, before issuing a permit proposing or authorizing the impoundment (with certain exemptions), diversion, or other control or modification of any body of water, consult with the appropriate State agency exercising jurisdiction over wildlife resources to conserve those resources.

              (iv) Are promulgated under subparts AA, BB, or CC of part 265 of this chapter limiting air emissions.
              (2) A permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated during its term for cause as set forth in §§ 270.41 and 270.43, or the permit may be modified upon the request of the permittee as set forth in § 270.42.
              (b) The issuance of a permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.
              (c) The issuance of a permit does not authorize any injury to persons or property or invasion of other private rights, or any infringement of State or local law or regulations.

              Noncompliance and program reporting by the Director.
              The Director shall prepare quarterly and annual reports as detailed below. When the State is the permit-issuing authority, the State Director shall submit any reports required under this section to the Regional Administrator. When EPA is the permit-issuing authority, the Regional Administrator shall submit any report required under this section to EPA Headquarters. For purposes of this section only, RCRA permittees shall include RCRA interim status facilities, when appropriate.
              (a) Quarterly reports. The Director shall submit quarterly narrative reports for major facilities as follows:
              (1) Format. The report shall use the following format:
              (i) Information on noncompliance for each facility;
              (ii) Alphabetize by permittee name. When two or more permittees have the same name, the lowest permit number shall be entered first; and
              (iii) For each entry on the list, include the following information in the following order:

              (A) Name, location, and permit number of the noncomplying permittee.
              
              (B) A brief description and date of each instance of noncompliance for that permittee. Instances of noncompliance may include one or more of the kinds set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. When a permittee has noncompliance of more than one kind, combine the information into a single entry for each such permittee.
              (C) The date(s) and a brief description of the action(s) taken by the Director to ensure compliance.
              (D) Status of the instance(s) of noncompliance with the date of the review of the status or the date of resolution.
              (E) Any details which tend to explain or mitigate the instance(s) of noncompliance.
              (2) Instances of noncompliance to be reported. Any instances of noncompliance within the following categories shall be reported in successive reports until the noncompliance is reported as resolved. Once noncompliance is reported as resolved it need not appear in subsequent reports.
              (i) Failure to complete construction elements. When the permittee has failed to complete, by the date specified in the permit, an element of a compliance schedule involving either planning for construction (for example, award of a contract, preliminary plans), or a construction step (for example, begin construction, attain operation level); and the permittee has not returned to compliance by accomplishing the required element of the schedule within 30 days from the date a compliance schedule report is due under the permit.
              (ii) Modifications to schedules of compliance. When a schedule of compliance in the permit has been modified under § 270.41 or § 270.42 because of the permittee's noncompliance.
              (iii) Failure to complete or provide compliance schedule or monitoring reports. When the permittee has failed to complete or provide a report required in a permit compliance schedule (for example, progress report or notice of noncompliance or compliance) or a monitoring report; and the permittee has not submitted the complete report within 30 days from the date it is due under the permit for compliance schedules, or from the date specified in the permit for monitoring reports.
              (iv) Deficient reports. When the required reports provided by the permittee are so deficient as to cause misunderstanding by the Director and thus impede the review of the status of compliance.
              (v) Noncompliance with other permit requirements. Noncompliance shall be reported in the following circumstances:
              (A) Whenever the permittee has violated a permit requirement (other than reported under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section), and has not returned to compliance within 45 days from the date reporting of noncompliance was due under the permit; or
              (B) When the Director determines that a pattern of noncompliance exists for a major facility permittee over the most recent four consecutive reporting periods. This pattern includes any violation of the same requirement in two consecutive reporting periods, and any violation of one or more requirements in each of four consecutive reporting periods; or
              (C) When the Director determines significant permit non-compliance or other significant event has occurred such as a fire or explosion or migration of fluids into a USDW.
              (vi) All other. Statistical information shall be reported quarterly on all other instances of noncompliance by major facilities with permit requirements not otherwise reported under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (b) Annual reports—(1) Annual noncompliance report. Statistical reports shall be submitted by the Director on nonmajor RCRA permittees indicating the total number reviewed, the number of noncomplying nonmajor permittees, the number of enforcement actions, and number of permit modifications extending compliance deadlines. The statistical information shall be organized to follow the types of noncompliance listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

              (2) In addition to the annual noncompliance report, the Director shall prepare a “program report” which contains information (in a manner and form prescribed by the Administrator) on generators and transporters and the permit status of regulated facilities. The Director shall also include, on a biennial basis, summary information on the quantities and types of hazardous wastes generated, transported, treated, stored and disposed during the preceding odd-numbered year. This summary information shall be reported in a manner and form prescribed by the Administrator and shall be reported according to EPA characteristics and lists of hazardous wastes at 40 CFR part 261.
              (c) Schedule. (1) For all quarterly reports. On the last working day of May, August, November, and February, the State Director shall submit to the Regional Administrator information concerning noncompliance with RCRA permit requirements by major facilities in the State in accordance with the following schedule.

            Subpart B—Permit Application
            
              § 270.10
              General application requirements.
              (a) Applying for a permit. Below is information on how to obtain a permit and where to find requirements for specific permits:
              (1) If you are covered by RCRA permits by rule (§ 270.60), you need not apply.
              (2) If you currently have interim status, you must apply for permits when required by the Director.
              (3) If you are required to have a permit (including new applicants and permittees with expiring permits), you must complete, sign, and submit an application to the Director, as described in this section and §§ 270.70 through 270.73.
              (4) If you are seeking an emergency permit, the procedures for application, issuance, and administration are found exclusively in § 270.61.
              (5) If you are seeking a research, development, and demonstration permit, the procedures for application, issuance, and administration are found exclusively in § 270.65.
              (6) If you are seeking a standardized permit, the procedures for application and issuance are found in part 124, subpart G of this chapter and subpart J of this part.
              (b) Who applies? When a facility or activity is owned by one person but is operated by another person, it is the operator's duty to obtain a permit, except that the owner must also sign the permit application.
              
              (c) Completeness. The Director shall not issue a permit before receiving a complete application for a permit except for permits by rule, or emergency permits. An application for a permit is complete when the Director receives an application form and any supplemental information which are completed to his satisfaction. An application for a permit is complete notwithstanding the failure of the owner or operator to submit the exposure information described in paragraph (j) of this section. The Director may deny a permit for the active life of a hazardous waste management facility or unit before receiving a complete application for a permit.
              (d) Information requirements. All applicants for RCRA permits shall provide information set forth in § 270.13 and applicable sections in §§ 270.14 through 270.29 to the Director, using the application form provided by the Director.
              (e) Existing HWM facilities and interim status qualifications. (1) Owners and operators of existing hazardous waste management facilities or of hazardous waste management facilities in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory amendments under the act that render the facility subject to the requirement to have a RCRA permit must submit part A of their permit application no later than:
              (i) Six months after the date of publication of regulations which first require them to comply with the standards set forth in 40 CFR part 265 or 266, or
              (ii) Thirty days after the date they first become subject to the standards set forth in 40 CFR part 265 or 266, whichever first occurs.

              (iii) For generators generating greater than 100 kilograms but less than 1000 kilograms of hazardous waste in a calendar month and treats, stores, or disposes of these wastes on-site, by March 24, 1987.
              
              
                Note:

                For facilities which must comply with part 265 because they handle a waste listed in EPA's May 19, 1980, part 261 regulations (45 FR 33006 et seq.), the deadline for submitting an application is November 19, 1980. Where other existing facilities must begin in complying with part 265 or 266 at a later date because of revisions to part 260, 261, 265, or 266, the Administrator will specify in the preamble to those revisions when those facilities must submit a permit application.
              
              
              (2) The Administrator may by publication in the Federal Register extend the date by which owners and operators of specified classes of existing hazardous waste management facilities must submit part A of their permit application if he finds that (i) there has been substantial confusion as to whether the owners and operators of such facilities were required to file a permit application and (ii) such confusion is attributed to ambiguities in EPA's parts 260, 261, 265, or 266 regulations.
              (3) The Administrator may by compliance order issued under section 3008 of RCRA extend the date by which the owner and operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility must submit part A of their permit application.
              (4) The owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility may be required to submit part B of their permit application. The State Director may require submission of part B (or equivalent completion of the State RCRA application process) if the State in which the facility is located has received interim or final authorization; if not, the Regional Administrator may require submission of Part B. Any owner or operator shall be allowed at least six months from the date of request to submit part B of the application. Any owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility may voluntarily submit part B of the application at any time. Notwithstanding the above, any owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility must submit a part B permit application in accordance with the dates specified in § 270.73. Any owner or operator of a land disposal facility in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory amendments under this Act that render the facility subject to the requirement to have a RCRA permit must submit a part B application in accordance with the dates specified in § 270.73.

              (5) Failure to furnish a requested part B application on time, or to furnish in full the information required by the part B application, is grounds for termination of interim status under part 124.
              (f) New HWM facilities. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, no person shall begin physical construction of a new HWM facility without having submitted parts A and B of the permit application and having received a finally effective RCRA permit.

              (2) An application for a permit for a new hazardous waste management facility (including both Parts A and B) may be filed any time after promulgation of those standards in part 264, subpart I et seq. applicable to such facility. The application shall be filed with the Regional Administrator if at the time of application the State in which the new hazardous waste management facility is proposed to be located has not received interim or final authorization for permitting such facility; otherwise it shall be filed with the State Director. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, all applications must be submitted at least 180 days before physical construction is expected to commence.
              (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a person may construct a facility for the incineration of polychlorinated biphenyls pursuant to an approval issued by the Administrator under section (6)(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act and any person owning or operating such a facility may, at any time after construction or operation of such facility has begun, file an application for a RCRA permit to incinerate hazardous waste authorizing such facility to incinerate waste identified or listed under Subtitle C of RCRA.
              (g) Updating permit applications. (1) If any owner or operator of a hazardous waste management facility has filed Part A of a permit application and has not yet filed part B, the owner or operator shall file an amended part A application:
              (i) With the Regional Administrator if the facility is located in a State which has not obtained interim authorization or final authorization, within six months after the promulgation of revised regulations under part 261 listing or identifying additional hazardous wastes, if the facility is treating, storing or disposing of any of those newly listed or identified wastes.
              (ii) With the State Director, if the facility is located in a State which has obtained interim authorization or final authorization, no later than the effective date of regulatory provisions listing or designating wastes as hazardous in that State in addition to those listed or designated under the previously approved State program, if the facility is treating, storing or disposing of any of those newly listed or designated wastes; or
              (iii) As necessary to comply with provisions of § 270.72 for changes during interim status or with the analogous provisions of a State program approved for final authorization or interim authorization. Revised Part A applications necessary to comply with the provisions of § 270.72 shall be filed with the Regional Administrator if the State in which the facility in question is located does not have interim authorization or final authorization; otherwise it shall be filed with the State Director (if the State has an analogous provision).
              (2) The owner or operator of a facility who fails to comply with the updating requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not receive interim status as to the wastes not covered by duly filed part A applications.
              (h) Reapplying for a permit. If you have an effective permit and you want to reapply for a new one, you have two options:
              (1) You may submit a new application at least 180 days before the expiration date of the effective permit, unless the Director allows a later date; or
              (2) If you intend to be covered by a standardized permit, you may submit a Notice of Intent as described in § 270.51(e)(1) at least 180 days before the expiration date of the effective permit, unless the Director allows a later date. The Director may not allow you to submit applications or Notices of Intent later than the expiration date of the existing permit, except as allowed by § 270.51(e)(2).
              (i) Recordkeeping. Applicants shall keep records of all data used to complete permit applications and any supplemental information submitted under §§ 270.10(d), 270.13, 270.14 through 270.21 for a period of at least 3 years from the date the application is signed.
              (j) Exposure information. (1) After August 8, 1985, any part B permit application submitted by an owner or operator of a facility that stores, treats, or disposes of hazardous waste in a surface impoundment or a landfill must be accompanied by information, reasonably ascertainable by the owner or operator, on the potential for the public to be exposed to hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents through releases related to the unit. At a minimum, such information must address:
              (i) Reasonably foreseeable potential releases from both normal operations and accidents at the unit, including releases associated with transportation to or from the unit;
              (ii) The potential pathways of human exposure to hazardous wastes or constituents resulting from the releases described under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section; and
              (iii) The potential magnitude and nature of the human exposure resulting from such releases.
              (2) By August 8, 1985, owners and operators of a landfill or a surface impoundment who have already submitted a part B application must submit the exposure information required in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
              (k) The Director may require a permittee or an applicant to submit information in order to establish permit conditions under §§ 270.32(b)(2) and 270.50(d) of this chapter.
              (l) If the Director concludes, based on one or more of the factors listed in paragraph (l)(1) of this section that compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEE alone may not be protective of human health or the environment, the Director shall require the additional information or assessment(s) necessary to determine whether additional controls are necessary to ensure protection of human health and the environment. This includes information necessary to evaluate the potential risk to human health and/or the environment resulting from both direct and indirect exposure pathways. The Director may also require a permittee or applicant to provide information necessary to determine whether such an assessment(s) should be required.
              (1) The Director shall base the evaluation of whether compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEE alone is protective of human health or the environment on factors relevant to the potential risk from a hazardous waste combustion unit, including, as appropriate, any of the following factors:
              (i) Particular site-specific considerations such as proximity to receptors (such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, day care centers, parks, community activity centers, or other potentially sensitive receptors), unique dispersion patterns, etc.;
              (ii) Identities and quantities of emissions of persistent, bioaccumulative or toxic pollutants considering enforceable controls in place to limit those pollutants;
              (iii) Identities and quantities of nondioxin products of incomplete combustion most likely to be emitted and to pose significant risk based on known toxicities (confirmation of which should be made through emissions testing);
              (iv) Identities and quantities of other off-site sources of pollutants in proximity of the facility that significantly influence interpretation of a facility-specific risk assessment;
              (v) Presence of significant ecological considerations, such as the proximity of a particularly sensitive ecological area;
              (vi) Volume and types of wastes, for example wastes containing highly toxic constituents;
              (vii) Other on-site sources of hazardous air pollutants that significantly influence interpretation of the risk posed by the operation of the source in question;
              (viii) Adequacy of any previously conducted risk assessment, given any subsequent changes in conditions likely to affect risk; and
              (ix) Such other factors as may be appropriate.

              § 270.11
              Signatories to permit applications and reports.
              (a) Applications. All permit applications shall be signed as follows:
              (1) For a corporation: By a responsible corporate officer. For the purpose of this section, a responsible corporate officer means (i) A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy- or decisionmaking functions for the corporation, or (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second-quarter 1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.
              
              
                Note:
                EPA does not require specific assignments or delegations of authority to responsible corporate officers identified in § 270.11(a)(1)(i). The Agency will presume that these responsible corporate officers have the requisite authority to sign permit applications unless the corporation has notified the Director to the contrary. Corporate procedures governing authority to sign permit applications may provide for assignment or delegation to applicable corporate positions under § 270.11(a)(1)(ii) rather than to specific individuals.
              
              
              (2) For a partnership or sole proprietorship; by a general partner or the proprietor, respectively; or
              (3) For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency: by either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. For purposes of this section, a principal executive officer of a Federal agency includes: (i) The chief executive officer of the agency, or (ii) a senior executive officer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., Regional Administrators of EPA).
              (b) Reports. All reports required by permits and other information requested by the Director shall be signed by a person described in paragraph (a) of this section, or by a duly authorized representative of that person. A person is a duly authorized representative only if:
              (1) The authorization is made in writing by a person described in paragraph (a) of this section;
              (2) The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for overall operation of the regulated facility or activity such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or a well field, superintendent, or position of equivalent responsibility. (A duly authorized representative may thus be either a named individual or any individual occupying a named position); and
              (3) The written authorization is submitted to the Director.
              (c) Changes to authorization. If an authorization under paragraph (b) of this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to the Director prior to or together with any reports, information, or applications to be signed by an authorized representative.

              (d)(1) Any person signing a document under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must make the following certification:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision according to a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
              
              

              (2) For remedial action plans (RAPs) under subpart H of this part, if the operator certifies according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, then the owner may choose to make the following certification instead of the certification in paragraph (d)(1) of this section:
              
              
                
                Based on my knowledge of the conditions of the property described in the RAP and my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system referenced in the operator's certification, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

              (a) In accordance with 40 CFR part 2, any information submitted to EPA pursuant to these regulations may be claimed as confidential by the submitter. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission in the manner prescribed on the application form or instructions or, in the case of other submissions, by stamping the words “confidential business information” on each page containing such information. If no claim is made at the time of submission, EPA may make the information available to the public without further notice. If a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2 (Public Information).
              (b) Claims of confidentiality for the name and address of any permit applicant or permittee will be denied.

              § 270.14
              Contents of part B: General requirements.
              (a) Part B of the permit application consists of the general information requirements of this section, and the specific information requirements in §§ 0.14 through 270.29 applicable to the facility. The part B information requirements presented in §§ 270.14 through 270.29 reflect the standards promulgated in 40 CFR part 264. These information requirements are necessary in order for EPA to determine compliance with the part 264 standards. If owners and operators of HWM facilities can demonstrate that the information prescribed in part B can not be provided to the extent required, the Director may make allowance for submission of such information on a case-by-case basis. Information required in part B shall be submitted to the Director and signed in accordance with the requirements in § 270.11.

              (i) In order to determine the applicability of the seismic standard [§ 264.18(a)] the owner or operator of a new facility must identify the political jurisdiction (e.g., county, township, or election district) in which the facility is proposed to be located.
              
              
                [Comment: If the county or election district is not listed in appendix VI of part 264, no further information is required to demonstrate compliance with § 264.18(a).]
              
              
              (ii) If the facility is proposed to be located in an area listed in appendix VI of part 264, the owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance with the seismic standard. This demonstration may be made using either published geologic data or data obtained from field investigations carried out by the applicant. The information provided must be of such quality to be acceptable to geologists experienced in identifying and evaluating seismic activity. The information submitted must show that either:
              (A) No faults which have had displacement in Holocene time are present, or no lineations which suggest the presence of a fault (which have displacement in Holocene time) within 3,000 feet of a facility are present, based on data from:
              (1) Published geologic studies,
              (2) Aerial reconnaissance of the area within a five-mile radius from the facility.
              (3) An analysis of aerial photographs covering a 3,000 foot radius of the facility, and
              (4) If needed to clarify the above data, a reconnaissance based on walking portions of the area within 3,000 feet of the facility, or

              (B) If faults (to include lineations) which have had displacement in Holocene time are present within 3,000 feet of a facility, no faults pass within 200 feet of the portions of the facility where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted, based on data from a comprehensive geologic analysis of the site. Unless a site analysis is otherwise conclusive concerning the absence of faults within 200 feet of such portions of the facility data shall be obtained from a subsurface exploration (trenching) of the area within a distance no less than 200 feet from portions of the facility where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted. Such trenching shall be performed in a direction that is perpendicular to known faults (which have had displacement in Holocene time) passing within 3,000 feet of the portions of the facility where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted. Such investigation shall document with supporting maps and other analyses, the location of faults found.
              
              
                [Comment: The Guidance Manual for the Location Standards provides greater detail on the content of each type of seismic investigation and the appropriate conditions under which each approach or a combination of approaches would be used.]
              
              

              (iii) Owners and operators of all facilities shall provide an identification of whether the facility is located within a 100-year floodplain. This identification must indicate the source of data for such determination and include a copy of the relevant Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) flood map, if used, or the calculations and maps used where an FIA map is not available. Information shall also be provided identifying the 100-year flood level and any other special flooding factors (e.g., wave action) which must be considered in designing, constructing, operating, or maintaining the facility to withstand washout from a 100-year flood.
              
              
                [Comment: Where maps for the National Flood Insurance Program produced by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency are available, they will normally be determinative of whether a facility is located within or outside of the 100-year floodplain. However, where the FIA map excludes an area (usually areas of the floodplain less than 200 feet in width), these areas must be considered and a determination made as to whether they are in the 100-year floodplain. Where FIA maps are not available for a proposed facility location, the owner or operator must use equivalent mapping techniques to determine whether the facility is within the 100-year floodplain, and if so located, what the 100-year flood elevation would be.]
              
              
              (iv) Owners and operators of facilities located in the 100-year floodplain must provide the following information:
              (A) Engineering analysis to indicate the various hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces expected to result at the site as consequence of a 100-year flood.
              (B) Structural or other engineering studies showing the design of operational units (e.g., tanks, incinerators) and flood protection devices (e.g., floodwalls, dikes) at the facility and how these will prevent washout.

              (1) Timing of such movement relative to flood levels, including estimated time to move the waste, to show that such movement can be completed before floodwaters reach the facility.
              (2) A description of the location(s) to which the waste will be moved and demonstration that those facilities will be eligible to receive hazardous waste in accordance with the regulations under parts 270, 271, 124, and 264 through 266 of this chapter.
              (3) The planned procedures, equipment, and personnel to be used and the means to ensure that such resources will be available in time for use.
              (4) The potential for accidental discharges of the waste during movement.
              (v) Existing facilities NOT in compliance with § 264.18(b) shall provide a plan showing how the facility will be brought into compliance and a schedule for compliance.
              (12) An outline of both the introductory and continuing training programs by owners or operators to prepare persons to operate or maintain the HWM facility in a safe manner as required to demonstrate compliance with § 264.16.

                Note:
                For large HWM facilities the Agency will allow the use of other scales on a case-by-case basis.
              
              
              (20) Applicants may be required to submit such information as may be necessary to enable the Regional Administrator to carry out his duties under other Federal laws as required in § 270.3 of this part.
              (21) For land disposal facilities, if a case-by-case extension has been approved under § 268.5 or a petition has been approved under § 268.6, a copy of the notice of approval for the extension or petition is required.

            Subpart C—Permit Conditions
            
              § 270.30
              Conditions applicable to all permits.
              The following conditions apply to all RCRA permits, and shall be incorporated into the permits either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, a specific citation to these regulations (or the corresponding approved State regulations) must be given in the permit.
              (a) Duty to comply. The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit, except that the permittee need not comply with the conditions of this permit to the extent and for the duration such noncompliance is authorized in an emergency permit. (See § 270.61). Any permit noncompliance, except under the terms of an emergency permit, constitutes a violation of the appropriate Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application.
              (b) Duty to reapply. If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by this permit after the expiration date of this permit, the permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit.
              (c) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.
              (d) In the event of noncompliance with the permit, the permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize releases to the environment, and shall carry out such measures as are reasonable to prevent significant adverse impacts on human health or the environment.
              (e) Proper operation and maintenance. The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance includes effective performance, adequate funding, adequate operator staffing and training, and adequate laboratory and process controls, including appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems only when necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit.
              (f) Permit actions. This permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit condition.
              (g) Property rights. The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.
              (h) Duty to provide information. The permittee shall furnish to the Director, within a reasonable time, any relevant information which the Director may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating this permit, or to determine compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Director, upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit.
              (i) Inspection and entry. The permittee shall allow the Director, or an authorized representative, upon the presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law to:
              (1) Enter at reasonable times upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of this permit;
              (2) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of this permit;

              Requirements for recording and reporting of monitoring results.
              All permits shall specify:
              (a) Requirements concerning the proper use, maintenance, and installation, when appropriate, of monitoring equipment or methods (including biological monitoring methods when appropriate);
              (b) Required monitoring including type, intervals, and frequency sufficient to yield data which are representative of the monitored activity including, when appropriate, continuous monitoring;
              (c) Applicable reporting requirements based upon the impact of the regulated activity and as specified in parts 264, 266 and 267. Reporting shall be no less frequent than specified in the above regulations.
            
            
              § 270.32
              Establishing permit conditions.
              (a) In addition to conditions required in all permits (§ 270.30), the Director shall establish conditions, as required on a case-by-case basis, in permits under §§ 270.50 (duration of permits), 270.33(a) (schedules of compliance), 270.31 (monitoring), and for EPA issued permits only, 270.33(b) (alternate schedules of compliance) and 270.3 (considerations under Federal law).
              (b)(1) Each RCRA permit shall include permit conditions necessary to achieve compliance with the Act and regulations, including each of the applicable requirements specified in parts 264 and 266 through 268 of this chapter. In satisfying this provision, the Administrator may incorporate applicable requirements of parts 264 and 266 through 268 of this chapter directly into the permit or establish other permit conditions that are based on these parts.
              (2) Each permit issued under section 3005 of this act shall contain terms and conditions as the Administrator or State Director determines necessary to protect human health and the environment.
              (3) If, as the result of an assessment(s) or other information, the Administrator or Director determines that conditions are necessary in addition to those required under 40 CFR parts 63, subpart EEE, 264 or 266 to ensure protection of human health and the environment, he shall include those terms and conditions in a RCRA permit for a hazardous waste combustion unit.

              (c) For a State issued permit, an applicable requirement is a State statutory or regulatory requirement which takes effect prior to final administrative disposition of a permit. For a permit issued by EPA, an applicable requirement is a statutory or regulatory requirement (including any interim final regulation) which takes effect prior to the issuance of the permit. Section 124.14 (reopening of comment period) provides a means for reopening EPA permit proceedings at the discretion of the Director where new requirements become effective during the permitting process and are of sufficient magnitude to make additional proceedings desirable. For State and EPA administered programs, an applicable requirement is also any requirement which takes effect prior to the modification or revocation and reissuance of a permit, to the extent allowed in § 270.41.
              (d) New or reissued permits, and to the extent allowed under § 270.41, modified or revoked and reissued permits, shall incorporate each of the applicable requirements referenced in this section and in 40 CFR 270.31.
              (e) Incorporation. All permit conditions shall be incorporated either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, a specific citation to the applicable regulations or requirements must be given in the permit.

              (1) Time for compliance. Any schedules of compliance under this section shall require compliance as soon as possible.
              (2) Interim dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which exceeds 1 year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule shall set forth interim requirements and the dates for their achievement.
              (i) The time between interim dates shall not exceed 1 year.
              (ii) If the time necessary for completion of any interim requirement is more than 1 year and is not readily divisible into stages for completion, the permit shall specify interim dates for the submission of reports of progress toward completion of the interim requirements and indicate a projected completion date.
              (3) Reporting. The permit shall be written to require that no later than 14 days following each interim date and the final date of compliance, the permittee shall notify the Director in writing, of its compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements.
              (b) Alternative schedules of compliance. A RCRA permit applicant or permittee may cease conducting regulated activities (by receiving a terminal volume of hazardous waste and, for treatment and storage HWM facilities, closing pursuant to applicable requirements; and, for disposal HWM facilities, closing and conducting post-closure care pursuant to applicable requirements) rather than continue to operate and meet permit requirements as follows:
              (1) If the permittee decides to cease conducting regulated activities at a given time within the term of a permit which has already been issued:
              (i) The permit may be modified to contain a new or additional schedule leading to timely cessation of activities; or
              (ii) The permittee shall cease conducting permitted activities before noncompliance with any interim or final compliance schedule requirement already specified in the permit.
              (2) If the decision to cease conducting regulated activities is made before issuance of a permit whose term will include the termination date, the permit shall contain a schedule leading to termination which will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements.
              (3) If the permittee is undecided whether to cease conducting regulated activities, the Director may issue or modify a permit to contain two schedules as follows:
              (i) Both schedules shall contain an identical interim deadline requiring a final decision on whether to cease conducting regulated activities no later than a date which ensures sufficient time to comply with applicable requirements in a timely manner if the decision is to continue conducting regulated activities;
              (ii) One schedule shall lead to timely compliance with applicable requirements;
              (iii) The second schedule shall lead to cessation of regulated activities by a date which will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements;

              (iv) Each permit containing two schedules shall include a requirement that after the permittee has made a final decision under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section it shall follow the schedule leading to compliance if the decision is to continue conducting regulated activities, and follow the schedule leading to termination if the decision is to cease conducting regulated activities.
              (4) The applicant's or permittee's decision to cease conducting regulated activities shall be evidenced by a firm public commitment satisfactory to the Director, such as resolution of the board of directors of a corporation.

            Subpart D—Changes to Permit
            
              § 270.40
              Transfer of permits.
              (a) A permit may be transferred by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if the permit has been modified or revoked and reissued (under § 270.40(b) or § 270.41(b)(2)) to identify the new permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary under the appropriate Act.
              (b) Changes in the ownership or operational control of a facility may be made as a Class 1 modification with prior written approval of the Director in accordance with § 270.42 or as a routine change with prior approval under 40 CFR 124.213. The new owner or operator must submit a revised permit application no later than 90 days prior to the scheduled change. A written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility between the current and new permittees must also be submitted to the Director. When a transfer of ownership or operational control occurs, the old owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart H (Financial Requirements) until the new owner or operator has demonstrated that he or she is complying with the requirements of that subpart. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with subpart H requirements within six months of the date of the change of ownership or operational control of the facility. Upon demonstration to the Director by the new owner or operator of compliance with subpart H, the Director shall notify the old owner or operator that he or she no longer needs to comply with subpart H as of the date of demonstration.
              [53 FR 37935, Sept. 28, 1988, as amended at 70 FR 53475, Sept. 8, 2005]
            
            
              § 270.41
              Modification or revocation and reissuance of permits.
              When the Director receives any information (for example, inspects the facility, receives information submitted by the permittee as required in the permit (see § 270.30), receives a request for revocation and reissuance under § 124.5 or conducts a review of the permit file), he or she may determine whether one or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for modification, or revocation and reissuance or both exist. If cause exists, the Director may modify or revoke and reissue the permit accordingly, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section, and may request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is modified, only the conditions subject to modification are reopened. If a permit is revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and subject to revision and the permit is reissued for a new term. (See 40 CFR 124.5(c)(2).) If cause does not exist under this section, the Director shall not modify or revoke and reissue the permit, except on request of the permittee. If a permit modification is requested by the permittee, the Director shall approve or deny the request according to the procedures of § 270.42, or § 270.320 and 40 CFR part 124, subpart G. Otherwise, a draft permit must be prepared and other procedures in part 124 (or procedures of an authorized State program) followed.
              (a) Causes for modification. The following are causes for modification, but not revocation and reissuance, of permits; the following may be causes for revocation and reissuance, as well as modification, when the permittee requests or agrees.
              (1) Alterations. There are material and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility or activity which occurred after permit issuance which justify the application of permit conditions that are different or absent in the existing permit.
              
              (2) Information. The Director has received information. Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance.
              (3) New statutory requirements or regulations. The standards or regulations on which the permit was based have been changed by statute, through promulgation of new or amended standards or regulations, or by judicial decision after the permit was issued.
              (4) Compliance schedules. The Director determines good cause exists for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy.
              (5) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, when a permit for a land disposal facility is reviewed by the Director under § 270.50(d), the Director shall modify the permit as necessary to assure that the facility continues to comply with the currently applicable requirements in parts 124, 260 through 266, and 270.
              (b) Causes for modification or revocation and reissuance. The following are causes to modify or, alternatively, revoke and reissue a permit:
              (1) Cause exists for termination under § 270.43, and the Director determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is appropriate.
              (2) The Director has received notification (as required in the permit, see § 270.30(l)(3)) of a proposed transfer of the permit.
              (3) The Director has received notification under 40 CFR 124.202(b) of a facility owner or operator's intent to be covered by a standardized permit.
              (c) Facility siting. Suitability of the facility location will not be considered at the time of permit modification or revocation and reissuance unless new information or standards indicate that a threat to human health or the environment exists which was unknown at the time of permit issuance.
              [48 FR 14228, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 48 FR 30114, June 30, 1983; 50 FR 28752, July 15, 1985; 52 FR 45799, Dec. 1, 1987; 53 FR 37936, Sept. 28, 1988; 70 FR 53475, Sept. 8, 2005; 71 FR 40279, July 14, 2006]
            
            
              § 270.42
              Permit modification at the request of the permittee.
              (a) Class 1 modifications. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the permittee may put into effect Class 1 modifications listed in appendix I of this section under the following conditions:
              (i) The permittee must notify the Director concerning the modification by certified mail or other means that establish proof of delivery within 7 calendar days after the change is put into effect. This notice must specify the changes being made to permit conditions or supporting documents referenced by the permit and must explain why they are necessary. Along with the notice, the permittee must provide the applicable information required by §§ 270.13 through 270.21, 270.62, and 270.63.
              (ii) The permittee must send a notice of the modification to all persons on the facility mailing list, maintained by the Director in accordance with 40 CFR 124.10(c)(viii), and the appropriate units of State and local government, as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(ix). This notification must be made within 90 calendar days after the change is put into effect. For the Class I modifications that require prior Director approval, the notification must be made within 90 calendar days after the Director approves the request.
              (iii) Any person may request the Director to review, and the Director may for cause reject, any Class 1 modification. The Director must inform the permittee by certified mail that a Class 1 modification has been rejected, explaining the reasons for the rejection. If a Class 1 modification has been rejected, the permittee must comply with the original permit conditions.

              (2) Class 1 permit modifications identified in appendix I by an asterisk may be made only with the prior written approval of the Director.
              
              (3) For a Class 1 permit modification, the permittee may elect to follow the procedures in § 270.42(b) for Class 2 modifications instead of the Class 1 procedures. The permittee must inform the Director of this decision in the notice required in § 270.42(b)(1).
              (b) Class 2 modifications. (1) For Class 2 modifications, listed in appendix I of this section, the permittee must submit a modification request to the Director that:
              (i) Describes the exact change to be made to the permit conditions and supporting documents referenced by the permit;
              (ii) Identifies that the modification is a Class 2 modification;
              (iii) Explains why the modification is needed; and
              (iv) Provides the applicable information required by §§ 270.13 through 270.21, 270.62, and 270.63.
              (2) The permittee must send a notice of the modification request to all persons on the facility mailing list maintained by the Director and to the appropriate units of State and local government as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(ix) and must publish this notice in a major local newspaper of general circulation. This notice must be mailed and published within 7 days before or after the date of submission of the modification request, and the permittee must provide to the Director evidence of the mailing and publication. The notice must include:
              (i) Announcement of a 60-day comment period, in accordance with § 270.42(b)(5), and the name and address of an Agency contact to whom comments must be sent;
              (ii) Announcement of the date, time, and place for a public meeting held in accordance with § 270.42(b)(4);
              (iii) Name and telephone number of the permittee's contact person;
              (iv) Name and telephone number of an Agency contact person;
              (v) Location where copies of the modification request and any supporting documents can be viewed and copied; and
              (vi) The following statement: “The permittee's compliance history during the life of the permit being modified is available from the Agency contact person.”
              (3) The permittee must place a copy of the permit modification request and supporting documents in a location accessible to the public in the vicinity of the permitted facility.
              (4) The permittee must hold a public meeting no earlier than 15 days after the publication of the notice required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and no later than 15 days before the close of the 60-day comment period. The meeting must be held to the extent practicable in the vicinity of the permitted facility.
              (5) The public shall be provided 60 days to comment on the modification request. The comment period will begin on the date the permittee publishes the notice in the local newspaper. Comments should be submitted to the Agency contact identified in the public notice.
              (6)(i) No later than 90 days after receipt of the notification request, the Director must:
              (A) Approve the modification request, with or without changes, and modify the permit accordingly;
              (B) Deny the request;
              (C) Determine that the modification request must follow the procedures in § 270.42(c) for Class 3 modifications for the following reasons:
              (1) There is significant public concern about the proposed modification; or
              (2) The complex nature of the change requires the more extensive procedures of Class 3.
              (D) Approve the request, with or without changes, as a temporary authorization having a term of up to 180 days, or
              (E) Notify the permittee that he or she will decide on the request within the next 30 days.
              (ii) If the Director notifies the permittee of a 30-day extension for a decision, the Director must, no later than 120 days after receipt of the modification request:
              (A) Approve the modification request, with or without changes, and modify the permit accordingly;
              (B) Deny the request; or

              (C) Determine that the modification request must follow the procedures in § 270.42(c) for Class 3 modifications for the following reasons:
              
              (1) There is significant public concern about the proposed modification; or
              (2) The complex nature of the change requires the more extensive procedures of Class 3.
              (D) Approve the request, with or without changes, as a temporary authorization having a term of up to 180 days.
              (iii) If the Director fails to make one of the decisions specified in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section by the 120th day after receipt of the modification request, the permittee is automatically authorized to conduct the activities described in the modification request for up to 180 days, without formal Agency action. The authorized activities must be conducted as described in the permit modification request and must be in compliance with all appropriate standards of 40 CFR part 265. If the Director approves, with or without changes, or denies the modification request during the term of the temporary or automatic authorization provided for in paragraphs (b)(6) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, such action cancels the temporary or automatic authorization.
              (iv)(A) In the case of an automatic authorization under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, or a temporary authorization under paragraph (b)(6) (i)(D) or (ii)(D) of this section, if the Director has not made a final approval or denial of the modification request by the date 50 days prior to the end of the temporary or automatic authorization, the permittee must within seven days of that time send a notification to persons on the facility mailing list, and make a reasonable effort to notify other persons who submitted written comments on the modification request, that:
              (1) The permittee has been authorized temporarily to conduct the activities described in the permit modification request, and
              (2) Unless the Director acts to give final approval or denial of the request by the end of the authorization period, the permittee will receive authorization to conduct such activities for the life of the permit.
              (B) If the owner/operator fails to notify the public by the date specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, the effective date of the permanent authorization will be deferred until 50 days after the owner/operator notifies the public.
              (v) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii) of this section, if the Director does not finally approve or deny a modification request before the end of the automatic or temporary authorization period or reclassify the modification as a Class 3, the permittee is authorized to conduct the activities described in the permit modification request for the life of the permit unless modified later under § 270.41 or § 270.42. The activities authorized under this paragraph must be conducted as described in the permit modification request and must be in compliance with all appropriate standards of 40 CFR part 265.
              (vi) In making a decision to approve or deny a modification request, including a decision to issue a temporary authorization or to reclassify a modification as a Class 3, the Director must consider all written comments submitted to the Agency during the public comment period and must respond in writing to all significant comments in his or her decision.
              (vii) With the written consent of the permittee, the Director may extend indefinitely or for a specified period the time periods for final approval or denial of a modification request or for reclassifying a modification as a Class 3.
              (7) The Director may deny or change the terms of a Class 2 permit modification request under paragraphs (b)(6) (i) through (iii) of this section for the following reasons:
              (i) The modification request is incomplete;
              (ii) The requested modification does not comply with the appropriate requirements of 40 CFR part 264 or other applicable requirements; or
              (iii) The conditions of the modification fail to protect human health and the environment.

              (8) The permittee may perform any construction associated with a Class 2 permit modification request beginning 60 days after the submission of the request unless the Director establishes a later date for commencing construction and informs the permittee in writing before day 60.
              
              (c) Class 3 modifications. (1) For Class 3 modifications listed in appendix I of this section, the permittee must submit a modification request to the Director that:
              (i) Describes the exact change to be made to the permit conditions and supporting documents referenced by the permit;
              (ii) Identifies that the modification is a Class 3 modification;
              (iii) Explains why the modification is needed; and
              (iv) Provides the applicable information required by 40 CFR 270.13 through 270.22, 270.62, 270.63, and 270.66.
              (2) The permittee must send a notice of the modification request to all persons on the facility mailing list maintained by the Director and to the appropriate units of State and local government as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(ix) and must publish this notice in a major local newspaper of general circulation. This notice must be mailed and published within seven days before or after the date of submission of the modification request, and the permittee must provide to the Director evidence of the mailing and publication. The notice must include:
              (i) Announcement of a 60-day comment period, and a name and address of an Agency contact to whom comments must be sent;
              (ii) Announcement of the date, time, and place for a public meeting on the modification request, in accordance with § 270.42(c)(4);
              (iii) Name and telephone number of the permittee's contact person;
              (iv) Name and telephone number of an Agency contact person;
              (v) Location where copies of the modification request and any supporting documents can be viewed and copied; and
              (vi) The following statement: “The permittee's compliance history during the life of the permit being modified is available from the Agency contact person.”
              (3) The permittee must place a copy of the permit modification request and supporting documents in a location accessible to the public in the vicinity of the permitted facility.
              (4) The permittee must hold a public meeting no earlier than 15 days after the publication of the notice required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and no later than 15 days before the close of the 60-day comment period. The meeting must be held to the extent practicable in the vicinity of the permitted facility.
              (5) The public shall be provided at least 60 days to comment on the modification request. The comment period will begin on the date the permittee publishes the notice in the local newspaper. Comments should be submitted to the Agency contact identified in the notice.
              (6) After the conclusion of the 60-day comment period, the Director must grant or deny the permit modification request according to the permit modification procedures of 40 CFR part 124. In addition, the Director must consider and respond to all significant written comments received during the 60-day comment period.
              (d) Other modifications. (1) In the case of modifications not explicitly listed in appendix I of this section, the permittee may submit a Class 3 modification request to the Agency, or he or she may request a determination by the Director that the modification should be reviewed and approved as a Class 1 or Class 2 modification. If the permittee requests that the modification be classified as a Class 1 or 2 modification, he or she must provide the Agency with the necessary information to support the requested classification.
              (2) The Director shall make the determination described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as promptly as practicable. In determining the appropriate class for a specific modification, the Director shall consider the similarity of the modification to other modifications codified in appendix I and the following criteria:
              (i) Class 1 modifications apply to minor changes that keep the permit current with routine changes to the facility or its operation. These changes do not substantially alter the permit conditions or reduce the capacity of the facility to protect human health or the environment. In the case of Class 1 modifications, the Director may require prior approval.

              (ii) Class 2 modifications apply to changes that are necessary to enable a permittee to respond, in a timely manner, to,
              (A) Common variations in the types and quantities of the wastes managed under the facility permit,
              (B) Technological advancements, and
              (C) Changes necessary to comply with new regulations, where these changes can be implemented without substantially changing design specifications or management practices in the permit.
              (iii) Class 3 modifications substantially alter the facility or its operation.
              (e) Temporary authorizations. (1) Upon request of the permittee, the Director may, without prior public notice and comment, grant the permittee a temporary authorization in accordance with this subsection. Temporary authorizations must have a term of not more than 180 days.
              (2)(i) The permittee may request a temporary authorization for:
              (A) Any Class 2 modification meeting the criteria in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, and
              (B) Any Class 3 modification that meets the criteria in paragraph (3)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section; or that meets the criteria in paragraphs (3)(ii) (C) through (E) of this section and provides improved management or treatment of a hazardous waste already listed in the facility permit.
              (ii) The temporary authorization request must include:
              (A) A description of the activities to be conducted under the temporary authorization;
              (B) An explanation of why the temporary authorization is necessary; and
              (C) Sufficient information to ensure compliance with 40 CFR part 264 standards.
              (iii) The permittee must send a notice about the temporary authorization request to all persons on the facility mailing list maintained by the Director and to appropriate units of State and local governments as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(ix). This notification must be made within seven days of submission of the authorization request.
              (3) The Director shall approve or deny the temporary authorization as quickly as practical. To issue a temporary authorization, the Director must find:
              (i) The authorized activities are in compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part 264.
              (ii) The temporary authorization is necessary to achieve one of the following objectives before action is likely to be taken on a modification request:
              (A) To facilitate timely implementation of closure or corrective action activities;
              (B) To allow treatment or storage in tanks or containers, or in containment buildings in accordance with 40 CFR part 268;
              (C) To prevent disruption of ongoing waste management activities;
              (D) To enable the permittee to respond to sudden changes in the types or quantities of the wastes managed under the facility permit; or
              (E) To facilitate other changes to protect human health and the environment.
              (4) A temporary authorization may be reissued for one additional term of up to 180 days provided that the permittee has requested a Class 2 or 3 permit modification for the activity covered in the temporary authorization, and:
              (i) The reissued temporary authorization constitutes the Director's decision on a Class 2 permit modification in accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(i)(D) or (ii)(D) of this section, or
              (ii) The Director determines that the reissued temporary authorization involving a Class 3 permit modification request is warranted to allow the authorized activities to continue while the modification procedures of paragraph (c) of this section are conducted.
              (f) Public notice and appeals of permit modification decisions. (1) The Director shall notify persons on the facility mailing list and appropriate units of State and local government within 10 days of any decision under this section to grant or deny a Class 2 or 3 permit modification request.

              § 270.51
              Continuation of expiring permits.
              (a) EPA permits. When EPA is the permit-issuing authority, the conditions of an expired permit continue in force under 5 U.S.C. 558(c) until the effective date of a new permit (see § 124.15) if:
              (1) The permittee has submitted a timely application under § 270.14 and the applicable sections in §§ 270.15 through 270.29 which is a complete (under § 270.10(c)) application for a new permit; and
              (2) The Regional Administrator through no fault of the permittee, does not issue a new permit with an effective date under § 124.15 on or before the expiration date of the previous permit (for example, when issuance is impracticable due to time or resource constraints).
              (b) Effect. Permits continued under this section remain fully effective and enforceable.
              (c) Enforcement. When the permittee is not in compliance with the conditions of the expiring or expired permit, the Regional Administrator may choose to do any or all of the following:
              (1) Initiate enforcement action based upon the permit which has been continued;
              (2) Issue a notice of intent to deny the new permit under § 124.6. If the permit is denied, the owner or operator would then be required to cease the activities authorized by the continued permit or be subject to enforcement action for operating without a permit;
              (3) Issue a new permit under part 124 with appropriate conditions; or
              (4) Take other actions authorized by these regulations.
              (d) State continuation. In a State with a hazardous waste program authorized under 40 CFR part 271, if a permittee has submitted a timely and complete application under applicable State law and regulations, the terms and conditions of an EPA-issued RCRA permit continue in force beyond the expiration date of the permit, but only until the effective date of the State's issuance or denial of a State RCRA permit.
              (e) Standardized permits. (1) The conditions of your expired standardized permit continue until the effective date of your new permit (see 40 CFR 124.15) if all of the following are true:
              (i) If EPA is the permit-issuing authority.
              (ii) If you submit a timely and complete Notice of Intent under 40 CFR 124.202(b) requesting coverage under a RCRA standardized permit; and
              (iii) If the Director, through no fault on your part, does not issue your permit before your previous permit expires (for example, where it is impractical to make the permit effective by that date because of time or resource constraints).
              (2) In some cases, the Director may notify you that you are not eligible for a standardized permit (see 40 CFR 124.206). In those cases, the conditions of your expired permit will continue if you submit the information specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (that is, a complete application for a new permit) within 60 days after you receive our notification that you are not eligible for a standardized permit.

              § 270.62
              Hazardous waste incinerator permits.

              When an owner or operator of a hazardous waste incineration unit becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005, or when an owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste incineration unit demonstrates compliance with the air emission standards and limitations in part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter (i.e., by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with all applicable requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter), the requirements of this section do not apply, except those provisions the Director determines are necessary to ensure compliance with §§ 264.345(a) and 264.345(c) of this chapter if you elect to comply with § 270.235(a)(1)(i) to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events. Nevertheless, the Director may apply the provisions of this section, on a case-by-case basis, for purposes of information collection in accordance with §§ 270.10(k), 270.10(l), 270.32(b)(2), and 270.32(b)(3).
              (a) For the purposes of determining operational readiness following completion of physical construction, the Director must establish permit conditions, including but not limited to allowable waste feeds and operating conditions, in the permit to a new hazardous waste incinerator. These permit conditions will be effective for the minimum time required to bring the incinerator to a point of operational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed 720 hours operating time for treatment of hazardous waste. The Director may extend the duration of this operational period once, for up to 720 additional hours, at the request of the applicant when good cause is shown. The permit may be modified to reflect the extension according to § 270.42 of this chapter.
              (1) Applicants must submit a statement, with part B of the permit application, which suggests the conditions necessary to operate in compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter during this period. This statement should include, at a minimum, restrictions on waste constituents, waste feed rates and the operating parameters identified in § 264.345 of this chapter.
              (2) The Director will review this statement and any other relevant information submitted with part B of the permit application and specify requirements for this period sufficient to meet the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter based on his engineering judgment.
              (b) For the purposes of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter and of determining adequate operating conditions under § 264.345 of this chapter, the Director must establish conditions in the permit for a new hazardous waste incinerator to be effective during the trial burn.
              (1) Applicants must propose a trial burn plan, prepared under paragraph (b)(2) of this section with a part B of the permit application.
              (2) The trial burn plan must include the following information:
              (i) An analysis of each waste or mixture of wastes to be burned which includes:
              (A) Heat value of the waste in the form and composition in which it will be burned.
              (B) Viscosity (if applicable), or description of the physical form of the waste.

              (C) An identification of any hazardous organic constituents listed in part 261, appendix VIII of this chapter, which are present in the waste to be burned, except that the applicant need not analyze for constituents listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter which would reasonably not be expected to be found in the waste. The constituents excluded from analysis must be identified, and the basis for the exclusion stated. The waste analysis must rely on appropriate analytical techniques.
              (D) An approximate quantification of the hazardous constituents identified in the waste, within the precision produced by appropriate analytical methods.
              (ii) A detailed engineering description of the incinerator for which the permit is sought including:
              (A) Manufacturer's name and model number of incinerator (if available).
              (B) Type of incinerator.
              (C) Linear dimensions of the incinerator unit including the cross sectional area of combustion chamber.
              (D) Description of the auxiliary fuel system (type/feed).
              (E) Capacity of prime mover.
              (F) Description of automatic waste feed cut-off system(s).
              (G) Stack gas monitoring and pollution control equipment.
              (H) Nozzle and burner design.
              (I) Construction materials.
              (J) Location and description of temperature, pressure, and flow indicating and control devices.
              (iii) A detailed description of sampling and monitoring procedures, including sampling and monitoring locations in the system, the equipment to be used, sampling and monitoring frequency, and planned analytical procedures for sample analysis.
              (iv) A detailed test schedule for each waste for which the trial burn is planned including date(s), duration, quantity of waste to be burned, and other factors relevant to the Director's decision under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
              (v) A detailed test protocol, including, for each waste identified, the ranges of temperature, waste feed rate, combustion gas velocity, use of auxiliary fuel, and any other relevant parameters that will be varied to affect the destruction and removal efficiency of the incinerator.
              (vi) A description of, and planned operating conditions for, any emission control equipment which will be used.
              (vii) Procedures for rapidly stopping waste feed, shutting down the incinerator, and controlling emissions in the event of an equipment malfunction.
              (viii) Such other information as the Director reasonably finds necessary to determine whether to approve the trial burn plan in light of the purposes of this paragraph and the criteria in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
              (3) The Director, in reviewing the trial burn plan, shall evaluate the sufficiency of the information provided and may require the applicant to supplement this information, if necessary, to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.
              (4) Based on the waste analysis data in the trial burn plan, the Director will specify as trial Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs), those constituents for which destruction and removal efficiencies must be calculated during the trial burn. These trial POHCs will be specified by the Director based on his estimate of the difficulty of incineration of the constituents identified in the waste analysis, their concentration or mass in the waste feed, and, for wastes listed in part 261, subpart D, of this chapter, the hazardous waste organic constituent or constituents identified in appendix VII of that part as the basis for listing.
              (5) The Director shall approve a trial burn plan if he finds that:
              (i) The trial burn is likely to determine whether the incinerator performance standard required by § 264.343 of this chapter can be met;
              (ii) The trial burn itself will not present an imminent hazard to human health or the environment;
              (iii) The trial burn will help the Director to determine operating requirements to be specified under § 264.345 of this chapter; and
              (iv) The information sought in paragraphs (b)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section cannot reasonably be developed through other means.

              (6) The Director must send a notice to all persons on the facility mailing list as set forth in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(ix) and to the appropriate units of State and local government as set forth in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(x) announcing the scheduled commencement and completion dates for the trial burn. The applicant may not commence the trial burn until after the Director has issued such notice.
              (i) This notice must be mailed within a reasonable time period before the scheduled trial burn. An additional notice is not required if the trial burn is delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the facility or the permitting agency.
              (ii) This notice must contain:
              (A) The name and telephone number of the applicant's contact person;
              (B) The name and telephone number of the permitting agency's contact office;
              (C) The location where the approved trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and
              (D) An expected time period for commencement and completion of the trial burn.
              (7) During each approved trial burn (or as soon after the burn as is practicable), the applicant must make the following determinations:
              (i) A quantitative analysis of the trial POHCs in the waste feed to the incinerator.

              (ii) A quantitative analysis of the exhaust gas for the concentration and mass emissions of the trial POHCs, oxygen (O2) and hydrogen chloride (HCl).
              (iii) A quantitative analysis of the scrubber water (if any), ash residues, and other residues, for the purpose of estimating the fate of the trial POHCs.
              (iv) A computation of destruction and removal efficiency (DRE), in accordance with the DRE formula specified in § 264.343(a) of this chapter.
              (v) If the HCl emission rate exceeds 1.8 kilograms of HCl per hour (4 pounds per hour), a computation of HCl removal efficiency in accordance with § 264.343(b) of this chapter.
              (vi) A computation of particulate emissions, in accordance with § 264.343(c) of this chapter.
              (vii) An identification of sources of fugitive emissions and their means of control.
              (viii) A measurement of average, maximum, and minimum temperatures and combustion gas velocity.
              (ix) A continuous measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas.
              (x) Such other information as the Director may specify as necessary to ensure that the trial burn will determine compliance with the performance standards in § 264.343 of this chapter and to establish the operating conditions required by § 264.345 of this chapter as necessary to meet that performance standard.
              (8) The applicant must submit to the Director a certification that the trial burn has been carried out in accordance with the approved trial burn plan, and must submit the results of all the determinations required in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. This submission shall be made within 90 days of completion of the trial burn, or later if approved by the Director.
              (9) All data collected during any trial burn must be submitted to the Director following the completion of the trial burn.
              (10) All submissions required by this paragraph must be certified on behalf of the applicant by the signature of a person authorized to sign a permit application or a report under § 270.11.
              (11) Based on the results of the trial burn, the Director shall set the operating requirements in the final permit according to § 264.345 of this chapter. The permit modification shall proceed according to § 270.42.
              (c) For the purposes of allowing operation of a new hazardous waste incinerator following completion of the trial burn and prior to final modification of the permit conditions to reflect the trial burn results, the Director may establish permit conditions, including but not limited to allowable waste feeds and operating conditions sufficient to meet the requirements of § 264.345 of this chapter, in the permit to a new hazardous waste incinerator. These permit conditions will be effective for the minimum time required to complete sample analysis, data computation and submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, and modification of the facility permit by the Director.

              (1) Applicants must submit a statement, with part B of the permit application, which identifies the conditions necessary to operate in compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter, during this period. This statement should include, at a minimum, restrictions on waste constituents, waste feed rates, and the operating parameters in § 264.345 of this chapter.
              (2) The Director will review this statement and any other relevant information submitted with part B of the permit application and specify those requirements for this period most likely to meet the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter based on his engineering judgment.
              (d) For the purpose of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter and of determining adequate operating conditions under § 264.345 of this chapter, the applicant for a permit for an existing hazardous waste incinerator must prepare and submit a trial burn plan and perform a trial burn in accordance with § 270.19(b) and paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) and (b)(7) through (b)(10) of this section or, instead, submit other information as specified in § 270.19(c). The Director must announce his or her intention to approve the trial burn plan in accordance with the timing and distribution requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The contents of the notice must include: the name and telephone number of a contact person at the facility; the name and telephone number of a contact office at the permitting agency; the location where the trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and a schedule of the activities that are required prior to permit issuance, including the anticipated time schedule for agency approval of the plan and the time period during which the trial burn would be conducted. Applicants submitting information under § 270.19(a) are exempt from compliance with 40 CFR 264.343 and 264.345 and, therefore, are exempt from the requirement to conduct a trial burn. Applicants who submit trial burn plans and receive approval before submission of a permit application must complete the trial burn and submit the results, specified in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, with part B of the permit application. If completion of this process conflicts with the date set for submission of the part B application, the applicant must contact the Director to establish a later date for submission of the part B application or the trial burn results. Trial burn results must be submitted prior to issuance of the permit. When the applicant submits a trial burn plan with part B of the permit application, the Director will specify a time period prior to permit issuance in which the trial burn must be conducted and the results submitted.

              § 270.63
              Permits for land treatment demonstrations using field test or laboratory analyses.
              (a) For the purpose of allowing an owner or operator to meet the treatment demonstration requirements of § 264.272 of this chapter, the Director may issue a treatment demonstration permit. The permit must contain only those requirements necessary to meet the standards in § 264.272(c). The permit may be issued either as a treatment or disposal permit covering only the field test or laboratory analyses, or as a two-phase facility permit covering the field tests, or laboratory analyses, and design, construction operation and maintenance of the land treatment unit.
              (1) The Director may issue a two-phase facility permit if he finds that, based on information submitted in part B of the application, substantial, although incomplete or inconclusive, information already exists upon which to base the issuance of a facility permit.
              (2) If the Director finds that not enough information exists upon which he can establish permit conditions to attempt to provide for compliance with all of the requirements of subpart M, he must issue a treatment demonstration permit covering only the field test or laboratory analyses.

              (b) If the Director finds that a phased permit may be issued, he will establish, as requirements in the first phase of the facility permit, conditions for conducting the field tests or laboratory analyses. These permit conditions will include design and operating parameters (including the duration of the tests or analyses and, in the case of field tests, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the treatment zone), monitoring procedures, post-demonstration clean-up activities, and any other conditions which the Director finds may be necessary under § 264.272(c). The Director will include conditions in the second phase of the facility permit to attempt to meet all subpart M requirements pertaining to unit design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The Director will establish these conditions in the second phase of the permit based upon the substantial but incomplete or inconclusive information contained in the part B application.
              (1) The first phase of the permit will be effective as provided in § 124.15(b) of this chapter.
              (2) The second phase of the permit will be effective as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (c) When the owner or operator who has been issued a two-phase permit has completed the treatment demonstration, he must submit to the Director a certification, signed by a person authorized to sign a permit application or report under § 270.11, that the field tests or laboratory analyses have been carried out in accordance with the conditions specified in phase one of the permit for conducting such tests or analyses. The owner or operator must also submit all data collected during the field tests or laboratory analyses within 90 days of completion of those tests or analyses unless the Director approves a later date.
              (d) If the Director determines that the results of the field tests or laboratory analyses meet the requirements of § 264.272 of this chapter, he will modify the second phase of the permit to incorporate any requirements necessary for operation of the facility in compliance with part 264, subpart M, of this chapter, based upon the results of the field tests or laboratory analyses.
              (1) This permit modification may proceed under § 270.42, or otherwise will proceed as a modification under § 270.41(a)(2). If such modifications are necessary, the second phase of the permit will become effective only after those modifications have been made.
              (2) If no modifications of the second phase of the permit are necessary, the Director will give notice of his final decision to the permit applicant and to each person who submitted written comments on the phased permit or who requested notice of the final decision on the second phase of the permit. The second phase of the permit then will become effective as specified in § 124.15(b).

              (g) Interim status boilers and industrial furnaces. For the purpose of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of § 266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and of determining adequate operating conditions under § 266.103 of this chapter, applicants owning or operating existing boilers or industrial furnaces operated under the interim status standards of § 266.103 of this chapter must either prepare and submit a trial burn plan and perform a trial burn in accordance with the requirements of this section or submit other information as specified in § 270.22(a)(6). The Director must announce his or her intention to approve of the trial burn plan in accordance with the timing and distribution requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The contents of the notice must include: the name and telephone number of a contact person at the facility; the name and telephone number of a contact office at the permitting agency; the location where the trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and a schedule of the activities that are required prior to permit issuance, including the anticipated time schedule for agency approval of the plan and the time periods during which the trial burn would be conducted. Applicants who submit a trial burn plan and receive approval before submission of the part B permit application must complete the trial burn and submit the results specified in paragraph (f) of this section with the part B permit application. If completion of this process conflicts with the date set for submission of the part B application, the applicant must contact the Director to establish a later date for submission of the part B application or the trial burn results. If the applicant submits a trial burn plan with part B of the permit application, the trial burn must be conducted and the results submitted within a time period prior to permit issuance to be specified by the Director.

              § 270.70
              Qualifying for interim status.
              (a) Any person who owns or operates an “existing HWM facility” or a facility in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory amendments under the Act that render the facility subject to the requirement to have a RCRA permit shall have interim status and shall be treated as having been issued a permit to the extent he or she has:

              (1) Complied with the requirements of section 3010(a) of RCRA pertaining to notification of hazardous waste activity.
              
              
                [Comment: Some existing facilities may not be required to file a notification under section 3010(a) of RCRA. These facilities may qualify for interim status by meeting paragraph (a)(2) of this section.]
              
              
              
              (2) Complied with the requirements of § 270.10 governing submission of part A applications;
              (b) Failure to qualify for interim status. If EPA has reason to believe upon examination of a part A application that it fails to meet the requirements of § 270.13, it shall notify the owner or operator in writing of the apparent deficiency. Such notice shall specify the grounds for EPA's belief that the application is deficient. The owner or operator shall have 30 days from receipt to respond to such a notification and to explain or cure the alleged deficiency in his part A application. If, after such notification and opportunity for response, EPA determines that the application is deficient it may take appropriate enforcement action.
              (c) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any facility which has been previously denied a RCRA permit or if authority to operate the facility under RCRA has been previously terminated.

              § 270.71
              Operation during interim status.
              (a) During the interim status period the facility shall not:
              (1) Treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste not specified in part A of the permit application;
              (2) Employ processes not specified in part A of the permit application; or
              (3) Exceed the design capacities specified in part A of the permit application.
              (b) Interim status standards. During interim status, owners or operators shall comply with the interim status standards at 40 CFR part 265.
            
            
              § 270.72
              Changes during interim status.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), the owner or operator of an interim status facility may make the following changes at the facility:
              (1) Treatment, storage, or disposal of new hazardous wastes not previously identified in part A of the permit application (and, in the case of newly listed or identified wastes, addition of the units being used to treat, store, or dispose of the hazardous wastes on the effective date of the listing or identification) if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application prior to such treatment, storage, or disposal;
              (2) Increases in the design capacity of processes used at the facility if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application prior to such a change (along with a justification explaining the need for the change) and the Director approves the changes because:
              (i) There is a lack of available treatment, storage, or disposal capacity at other hazardous waste management facilities, or
              (ii) The change is necessary to comply with a Federal, State, or local requirement.
              (3) Changes in the processes for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste or addition of processes if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application prior to such change (along with a justification explaining the need for the change) and the Director approves the change because:
              (i) The change is necessary to prevent a threat to human health and the environment because of an emergency situation, or
              (ii) The change is necessary to comply with a Federal, State, or local requirement.

              (4) Changes in the ownership or operational control of a facility if the new owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application no later than 90 days prior to the scheduled change. When a transfer of operational control of a facility occurs, the old owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart H (Financial Requirements), until the new owner or operator has demonstrated to the Director that he is complying with the requirements of that subpart. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with subpart H requirements within six months of the date of the change in ownership or operational control of the facility. Upon demonstration to the Director by the new owner or operator of compliance with subpart H, the Director shall notify the old owner or operator in writing that he no longer needs to comply with subpart H as of the date of demonstration. All other interim status duties are transferred effective immediately upon the date of the change in ownership or operational control of the facility.
              (5) Changes made in accordance with an interim status corrective action order issued by EPA under section 3008(h) or other Federal authority, by an authorized State under comparable State authority, or by a court in a judicial action brought by EPA or by an authorized State. Changes under this paragraph are limited to the treatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases that originate within the boundary of the facility.
              (6) Addition of newly regulated units for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application on or before the date on which the unit becomes subject to the new requirements.
              (b) Except as specifically allowed under this paragraph, changes listed under paragraph (a) of this section may not be made if they amount to reconstruction of the hazardous waste management facility. Reconstruction occurs when the capital investment in the changes to the facility exceeds 50 percent of the capital cost of a comparable entirely new hazardous waste management facility. If all other requirements are met, the following changes may be made even if they amount to a reconstruction:
              (1) Changes made solely for the purposes of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 265.193 for tanks and ancillary equipment.
              (2) If necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements, changes to an existing unit, changes solely involving tanks or containers, or addition of replacement surface impoundments that satisfy the standards of section 3004(o).
              (3) Changes that are necessary to allow owners or operators to continue handling newly listed or identified hazardous wastes that have been treated, stored, or disposed of at the facility prior to the effective date of the rule establishing the new listing or identification.
              (4) Changes during closure of a facility or of a unit within a facility made in accordance with an approved closure plan.
              (5) Changes necessary to comply with an interim status corrective action order issued by EPA under section 3008(h) or other Federal authority, by an authorized State under comparable State authority, or by a court in a judicial proceeding brought by EPA or an authorized State, provided that such changes are limited to the treatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases that originate within the boundary of the facility.
              (6) Changes to treat or store, in tanks, containers, or containment buildings, hazardous wastes subject to land disposal restrictions imposed by part 268 of this chapter or RCRA section 3004, provided that such changes are made solely for the purpose of complying with part 268 of this chapter or RCRA section 3004.
              (7) Addition of newly regulated units under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
              (8) Changes necessary to comply with standards under 40 CFR part 63, Subpart EEE—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Hazardous Waste Combustors.

              Interim status terminates when:
              (a) Final administrative disposition of a permit application, except an application for a remedial action plan (RAP) under subpart H of this part, is made.
              (b) Interim status is terminated as provided in § 270.10(e)(5).
              (c) For owners or operators of each land disposal facility which has been granted interim status prior to November 8, 1984, on November 8, 1985, unless:

              (2) The owner or operator certifies that such facility is in compliance with all applicable ground-water monitoring and financial responsibility requirements.
              (d) For owners or operators of each land disposal facility which is in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory amendments under the Act that render the facility subject to the requirement to have a RCRA permit and which is granted interim status, twelve months after the date on which the facility first becomes subject to such permit requirement unless the owner or operator of such facility:
              (1) Submits a part B application for a RCRA permit for such facility before the date 12 months after the date on which the facility first becomes subject to such permit requirement; and
              (2) Certifies that such facility is in compliance with all applicable ground water monitoring and financial responsibility requirements.
              (e) For owners or operators of any land disposal unit that is granted authority to operate under § 270.72(a) (1), (2) or (3), on the date 12 months after the effective date of such requirement, unless the owner or operator certifies that such unit is in compliance with all applicable ground-water monitoring and financial responsibility requirements.
              (f) For owners and operators of each incinerator facility which has achieved interim status prior to November 8, 1984, interim status terminates on November 8, 1989, unless the owner or operator of the facility submits a part B application for a RCRA permit for an incinerator facility by November 8, 1986.
              (g) For owners or operators of any facility (other than a land disposal or an incinerator facility) which has achieved interim status prior to November 8, 1984, interim status terminates on November 8, 1992, unless the owner or operator of the facility submits a part B application for a RCRA permit for the facility by November 8, 1988.

              § 270.79
              Why is this subpart written in a special format?
              This subpart is written in a special format to make it easier to understand the regulatory requirements. Like other Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, this establishes enforceable legal requirements. For this subpart, “I” and “you” refer to the owner/operator.
            
            
              General Information
              
                § 270.80
                What is a RAP?
                (a) A RAP is a special form of RCRA permit that you, as an owner or operator, may obtain, instead of a permit issued under §§ 270.3 through 270.66, to authorize you to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous remediation waste (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) at a remediation waste management site. A RAP may only be issued for the area of contamination where the remediation wastes to be managed under the RAP originated, or areas in close proximity to the contaminated area, except as allowed in limited circumstances under § 270.230.
                (b) The requirements in §§ 270.3 through 270.66 do not apply to RAPs unless those requirements for traditional RCRA permits are specifically required under §§ 270.80 through 270.230. The definitions in § 270.2 apply to RAPs.
                (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or part 124 of this chapter, any document that meets the requirements in this section constitutes a RCRA permit under RCRA section 3005(c).
                (d) A RAP may be:
                (1) A stand-alone document that includes only the information and conditions required by this subpart; or

                (2) Part (or parts) of another document that includes information and/or conditions for other activities at the remediation waste management site, in addition to the information and conditions required by this subpart.
                
                (e) If you are treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous remediation wastes as part of a cleanup compelled by Federal or State cleanup authorities, your RAP does not affect your obligations under those authorities in any way.
                (f) If you receive a RAP at a facility operating under interim status, the RAP does not terminate your interim status.
              
              
                § 270.85
                When do I need a RAP?
                (a) Whenever you treat, store, or dispose of hazardous remediation wastes in a manner that requires a RCRA permit under § 270.1, you must either obtain:
                (1) A RCRA permit according to §§ 270.3 through 270.66; or
                (2) A RAP according to this subpart.
                (b) Treatment units that use combustion of hazardous remediation wastes at a remediation waste management site are not eligible for RAPs under this subpart.
                (c) You may obtain a RAP for managing hazardous remediation waste at an already permitted RCRA facility. You must have these RAPs approved as a modification to your existing permit according to the requirements of § 270.41 or § 270.42 instead of the requirements in this subpart. When you submit an application for such a modification, however, the information requirements in § 270.42(a)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iv), and (c)(1)(iv) do not apply; instead, you must submit the information required under § 270.110. When your permit is modified the RAP becomes part of the RCRA permit. Therefore when your permit (including the RAP portion) is modified, revoked and reissued, terminated or when it expires, it will be modified according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.40 through 270.42, revoked and reissued according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.41 and 270.43, terminated according to the applicable requirements in § 270.43, and expire according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.50 and 270.51.
              
              
                § 270.90
                Does my RAP grant me any rights or relieve me of any obligations?
                The provisions of § 270.4 apply to RAPs. (Note: The provisions of § 270.4(a) provide you assurance that, as long as you comply with your RAP, EPA will consider you in compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA, and will not take enforcement actions against you. However, you should be aware of four exceptions to this provision that are listed in § 270.4.)
              
            
            
              Applying for a RAP
              
                § 270.95
                How do I apply for a RAP?
                To apply for a RAP, you must complete an application, sign it, and submit it to the Director according to the requirements in this subpart.
              
              
                § 270.100
                Who must obtain a RAP?
                When a facility or remediation waste management site is owned by one person, but the treatment, storage or disposal activities are operated by another person, it is the operator's duty to obtain a RAP, except that the owner must also sign the RAP application.
              
              
                § 270.105
                Who must sign the application and any required reports for a RAP?
                Both the owner and the operator must sign the RAP application and any required reports according to § 270.11(a), (b), and (c). In the application, both the owner and the operator must also make the certification required under § 270.11(d)(1). However, the owner may choose the alternative certification under § 270.11(d)(2) if the operator certifies under § 270.11(d)(1).
              
              
                § 270.110
                What must I include in my application for a RAP?
                You must include the following information in your application for a RAP:
                (a) The name, address, and EPA identification number of the remediation waste management site;
                (b) The name, address, and telephone number of the owner and operator;
                (c) The latitude and longitude of the site;
                (d) The United States Geological Survey (USGS) or county map showing the location of the remediation waste management site;
                (e) A scaled drawing of the remediation waste management site showing:

                (1) The remediation waste management site boundaries;
                
                (2) Any significant physical structures; and
                (3) The boundary of all areas on-site where remediation waste is to be treated, stored or disposed;
                (f) A specification of the hazardous remediation waste to be treated, stored or disposed of at the facility or remediation waste management site. This must include information on:
                (1) Constituent concentrations and other properties of the hazardous remediation wastes that may affect how such materials should be treated and/or otherwise managed;
                (2) An estimate of the quantity of these wastes; and
                (3) A description of the processes you will use to treat, store, or dispose of this waste including technologies, handling systems, design and operating parameters you will use to treat hazardous remediation wastes before disposing of them according to the LDR standards of part 268 of this chapter, as applicable;
                (g) Enough information to demonstrate that operations that follow the provisions in your RAP application will ensure compliance with applicable requirements of parts 264, 266, and 268 of this chapter;
                (h) Such information as may be necessary to enable the Regional Administrator to carry out his duties under other Federal laws as is required for traditional RCRA permits under § 270.14(b)(20);
                (i) Any other information the Director decides is necessary for demonstrating compliance with this subpart or for determining any additional RAP conditions that are necessary to protect human health and the environment.
              
              
                § 270.115
                What if I want to keep this information confidential?
                Part 2 (Public Information) of this chapter allows you to claim as confidential any or all of the information you submit to EPA under this subpart. You must assert any such claim at the time that you submit your RAP application or other submissions by stamping the words “confidential business information” on each page containing such information. If you do assert a claim at the time you submit the information, EPA will treat the information according to the procedures in part 2 of this chapter. If you do not assert a claim at the time you submit the information, EPA may make the information available to the public without further notice to you. EPA will deny any requests for confidentiality of your name and/or address.
              
              
                § 270.120
                To whom must I submit my RAP application?
                You must submit your application for a RAP to the Director for approval.
              
              
                § 270.125
                If I submit my RAP application as part of another document, what must I do?
                If you submit your application for a RAP as a part of another document, you must clearly identify the components of that document that constitute your RAP application.
              
            
            
              Getting a RAP Approved
              
                § 270.130
                What is the process for approving or denying my application for a RAP?
                (a) If the Director tentatively finds that your RAP application includes all of the information required by § 270.110 and that your proposed remediation waste management activities meet the regulatory standards, the Director will make a tentative decision to approve your RAP application. The Director will then prepare a draft RAP and provide an opportunity for public comment before making a final decision on your RAP application, according to this subpart.

                (b) If the Director tentatively finds that your RAP application does not include all of the information required by § 270.110 or that your proposed remediation waste management activities do not meet the regulatory standards, the Director may request additional information from you or ask you to correct deficiencies in your application. If you fail or refuse to provide any additional information the Director requests, or to correct any deficiencies in your RAP application, the Director may make a tentative decision to deny your RAP application. After making this tentative decision, the Director will prepare a notice of intent to deny your RAP application (“notice of intent to deny”) and provide an opportunity for public comment before making a final decision on your RAP application, according to the requirements in this Subpart. The Director may deny the RAP application either in its entirety or in part.
              
              
                § 270.135
                What must the Director include in a draft RAP?
                If the Director prepares a draft RAP, it must include the:
                (a) Information required under § 270.110(a) through (f);
                (b) The following terms and conditions:
                (1) Terms and conditions necessary to ensure that the operating requirements specified in your RAP comply with applicable requirements of parts 264, 266, and 268 of this chapter (including any recordkeeping and reporting requirements). In satisfying this provision, the Director may incorporate, expressly or by reference, applicable requirements of parts 264, 266, and 268 of this chapter into the RAP or establish site-specific conditions as required or allowed by parts 264, 266, and 268 of this chapter;
                (2) Terms and conditions in § 270.30;
                (3) Terms and conditions for modifying, revoking and reissuing, and terminating your RAP, as provided in § 270.170; and
                (4) Any additional terms or conditions that the Director determines are necessary to protect human health and the environment, including any terms and conditions necessary to respond to spills and leaks during use of any units permitted under the RAP; and
                (c) If the draft RAP is part of another document, as described in § 270.80(d)(2), the Director must clearly identify the components of that document that constitute the draft RAP.

                What else must the Director prepare in addition to the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny?
                Once the Director has prepared the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny, he must then:
                (a) Prepare a statement of basis that briefly describes the derivation of the conditions of the draft RAP and the reasons for them, or the rationale for the notice of intent to deny;
                (b) Compile an administrative record, including:
                (1) The RAP application, and any supporting data furnished by the applicant;
                (2) The draft RAP or notice of intent to deny;
                (3) The statement of basis and all documents cited therein (material readily available at the issuing Regional office or published material that is generally available need not be physically included with the rest of the record, as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis); and
                (4) Any other documents that support the decision to approve or deny the RAP; and
                (c) Make information contained in the administrative record available for review by the public upon request.
              
              
                § 270.145
                What are the procedures for public comment on the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny?
                (a) The Director must:
                (1) Send notice to you of his intention to approve or deny your RAP application, and send you a copy of the statement of basis;
                (2) Publish a notice of his intention to approve or deny your RAP application in a major local newspaper of general circulation;
                (3) Broadcast his intention to approve or deny your RAP application over a local radio station; and
                (4) Send a notice of his intention to approve or deny your RAP application to each unit of local government having jurisdiction over the area in which your site is located, and to each State agency having any authority under State law with respect to any construction or operations at the site.
                (b) The notice required by paragraph (a) of this section must provide an opportunity for the public to submit written comments on the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny within at least 45 days.
                (c) The notice required by paragraph (a) of this section must include:

                (1) The name and address of the office processing the RAP application;
                
                (2) The name and address of the RAP applicant, and if different, the remediation waste management site or activity the RAP will regulate;
                (3) A brief description of the activity the RAP will regulate;
                (4) The name, address and telephone number of a person from whom interested persons may obtain further information, including copies of the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny, statement of basis, and the RAP application;
                (5) A brief description of the comment procedures in this section, and any other procedures by which the public may participate in the RAP decision;
                (6) If a hearing is scheduled, the date, time, location and purpose of the hearing;
                (7) If a hearing is not scheduled, a statement of procedures to request a hearing;
                (8) The location of the administrative record, and times when it will be open for public inspection; and
                (9) Any additional information the Director considers necessary or proper.
                (d) If, within the comment period, the Director receives written notice of opposition to his intention to approve or deny your RAP application and a request for a hearing, the Director must hold an informal public hearing to discuss issues relating to the approval or denial of your RAP application. The Director may also determine on his own initiative that an informal hearing is appropriate. The hearing must include an opportunity for any person to present written or oral comments. Whenever possible, the Director must schedule this hearing at a location convenient to the nearest population center to the remediation waste management site and give notice according to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section. This notice must, at a minimum, include the information required by paragraph (c) of this section and:
                (1) Reference to the date of any previous public notices relating to the RAP application;
                (2) The date, time and place of the hearing; and
                (3) A brief description of the nature and purpose of the hearing, including the applicable rules and procedures.
              
              
                § 270.150
                How will the Director make a final decision on my RAP application?
                (a) The Director must consider and respond to any significant comments raised during the public comment period, or during any hearing on the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny, and revise your draft RAP based on those comments, as appropriate.
                (b) If the Director determines that your RAP includes the information and terms and conditions required in § 270.135, then he will issue a final decision approving your RAP and, in writing, notify you and all commenters on your draft RAP that your RAP application has been approved.
                (c) If the Director determines that your RAP does not include the information required in § 270.135, then he will issue a final decision denying your RAP and, in writing, notify you and all commenters on your draft RAP that your RAP application has been denied.
                (d) If the Director's final decision is that the tentative decision to deny the RAP application was incorrect, he will withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a draft RAP, according to the requirements in this subpart.
                (e) When the Director issues his final RAP decision, he must refer to the procedures for appealing the decision under § 270.155.
                (f) Before issuing the final RAP decision, the Director must compile an administrative record. Material readily available at the issuing Regional office or published materials which are generally available and which are included in the administrative record need not be physically included with the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis or the response to comments. The administrative record for the final RAP must include information in the administrative record for the draft RAP (see § 270.140(b)) and:
                (1) All comments received during the public comment period;
                (2) Tapes or transcripts of any hearings;
                
                (3) Any written materials submitted at these hearings;
                (4) The responses to comments;
                (5) Any new material placed in the record since the draft RAP was issued;
                (6) Any other documents supporting the RAP; and (7) A copy of the final RAP.
                (g) The Director must make information contained in the administrative record available for review by the public upon request.
              
              
                § 270.155
                May the decision to approve or deny my RAP application be administratively appealed?
                (a) Any commenter on the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny, or any participant in any public hearing(s) on the draft RAP, may appeal the Director's decision to approve or deny your RAP application to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board under § 124.19 of this chapter. Any person who did not file comments, or did not participate in any public hearing(s) on the draft RAP, may petition for administrative review only to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final RAP decision. Appeals of RAPs may be made to the same extent as for final permit decisions under § 124.15 of this chapter (or a decision under § 270.29 to deny a permit for the active life of a RCRA hazardous waste management facility or unit).
                (b) This appeal is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of these EPA actions.

                § 270.160
                When does my RAP become effective?
                Your RAP becomes effective 30 days after the Director notifies you and all commenters that your RAP is approved unless:
                (a) The Director specifies a later effective date in his decision;
                (b) You or another person has appealed your RAP under § 270.155 (if your RAP is appealed, and the request for review is granted under § 270.155, conditions of your RAP are stayed according to § 124.16 of this chapter); or
                (c) No commenters requested a change in the draft RAP, in which case the RAP becomes effective immediately when it is issued.
              
              
                § 270.165
                When may I begin physical construction of new units permitted under the RAP?
                You must not begin physical construction of new units permitted under the RAP for treating, storing or disposing of hazardous remediation waste before receiving a finally effective RAP.
              
            
            
              How May My RAP Be Modified, Revoked and Reissued, or Terminated?
              
                § 270.170
                After my RAP is issued, how may it be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated?
                In your RAP, the Director must specify, either directly or by reference, procedures for future modifications, revocations and reissuance, or terminations of your RAP. These procedures must provide adequate opportunities for public review and comment on any modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination that would significantly change your management of your remediation waste, or that otherwise merits public review and comment. If your RAP has been incorporated into a traditional RCRA permit, as allowed under § 270.85(c), then the RAP will be modified according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.40 through 270.42, revoked and reissued according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.41 and 270.43, or terminated according to the applicable requirements of § 270.43.
              
              
                § 270.175
                For what reasons may the Director choose to modify my final RAP?
                (a) The Director may modify your final RAP on his own initiative only if one or more of the following reasons listed in this section exist(s). If one or more of these reasons do not exist, then the Director will not modify your final RAP, except at your request. Reasons for modification are:
                (1) You made material and substantial alterations or additions to the activity that justify applying different conditions;

                (2) The Director finds new information that was not available at the time of RAP issuance and would have justified applying different RAP conditions at the time of issuance;
                (3) The standards or regulations on which the RAP was based have changed because of new or amended statutes, standards or regulations, or by judicial decision after the RAP was issued;
                (4) If your RAP includes any schedules of compliance, the Director may find reasons to modify your compliance schedule, such as an act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which you as the owner/operator have little or no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy;
                (5) You are not in compliance with conditions of your RAP;
                (6) You failed in the application or during the RAP issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or you misrepresented any relevant facts at the time;
                (7) The Director has determined that the activity authorized by your RAP endangers human health or the environment and can only be remedied by modifying; or
                (8) You have notified the Director (as required in the RAP under § 270.30(l)(3)) of a proposed transfer of a RAP.
                (b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, when the Director reviews a RAP for a land disposal facility under § 270.195, he may modify the permit as necessary to assure that the facility continues to comply with the currently applicable requirements in parts 124, 260 through 266 and 270 of this chapter.
                (c) The Director will not reevaluate the suitability of the facility location at the time of RAP modification unless new information or standards indicate that a threat to human health or the environment exists that was unknown when the RAP was issued.
              
              
                § 270.180
                For what reasons may the Director choose to revoke and reissue my final RAP?
                (a) The Director may revoke and reissue your final RAP on his own initiative only if one or more reasons for revocation and reissuance exist(s). If one or more reasons do not exist, then the Director will not modify or revoke and reissue your final RAP, except at your request. Reasons for modification or revocation and reissuance are the same as the reasons listed for RAP modifications in § 270.175(a)(5) through (8) if the Director determines that revocation and reissuance of your RAP is appropriate.
                (b) The Director will not reevaluate the suitability of the facility location at the time of RAP revocation and reissuance, unless new information or standards indicate that a threat to human health or the environment exists that was unknown when the RAP was issued.
              
              
                § 270.185
                For what reasons may the Director choose to terminate my final RAP, or deny my renewal application?
                The Director may terminate your final RAP on his own initiative, or deny your renewal application for the same reasons as those listed for RAP modifications in § 270.175(a)(5) through (7) if the Director determines that termination of your RAP or denial of your RAP renewal application is appropriate.
              
              
                § 270.190
                May the decision to approve or deny a modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination of my RAP be administratively appealed?
                (a) Any commenter on the modification, revocation and reissuance or termination, or any person who participated in any hearing(s) on these actions, may appeal the Director's decision to approve a modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination of your RAP, according to § 270.155. Any person who did not file comments or did not participate in any public hearing(s) on the modification, revocation and reissuance or termination, may petition for administrative review only of the changes from the draft to the final RAP decision.

                (b) Any commenter on the modification, revocation and reissuance or termination, or any person who participated in any hearing(s) on these actions, may informally appeal the Director's decision to deny a request for modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board. Any person who did not file comments, or did not participate in any public hearing(s) on the modification, revocation and reissuance or termination may petition for administrative review only of the changes from the draft to the final RAP decision.
                (c) The process for informal appeals of RAPs is as follows:
                (1) The person appealing the decision must send a letter to the Environmental Appeals Board. The letter must briefly set forth the relevant facts.
                (2) The Environmental Appeals Board has 60 days after receiving the letter to act on it.
                (3) If the Environmental Appeals Board does not take action on the letter within 60 days after receiving it, the appeal shall be considered denied.
                (d) This informal appeal is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of these EPA actions.
              
              
                § 270.195
                When will my RAP expire?
                RAPs must be issued for a fixed term, not to exceed 10 years, although they may be renewed upon approval by the Director in fixed increments of no more than ten years. In addition, the Director must review any RAP for hazardous waste land disposal five years after the date of issuance or reissuance and you or the Director must follow the requirements for modifying your RAP as necessary to assure that you continue to comply with currently applicable requirements in RCRA sections 3004 and 3005.
              
              
                § 270.200
                How may I renew my RAP if it is expiring?
                If you wish to renew your expiring RAP, you must follow the process for application for and issuance of RAPs in this subpart.
              
              
                § 270.205
                What happens if I have applied correctly for a RAP renewal but have not received approval by the time my old RAP expires?
                If you have submitted a timely and complete application for a RAP renewal, but the Director, through no fault of yours, has not issued a new RAP with an effective date on or before the expiration date of your previous RAP, your previous RAP conditions continue in force until the effective date of your new RAP or RAP denial.
              
            
            
              Operating Under Your RAP
              
                § 270.210
                What records must I maintain concerning my RAP?
                You are required to keep records of:
                (a) All data used to complete RAP applications and any supplemental information that you submit for a period of at least 3 years from the date the application is signed; and
                (b) Any operating and/or other records the Director requires you to maintain as a condition of your RAP.
              
              
                § 270.215
                How are time periods in the requirements in this subpart and my RAP computed?
                (a) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act or event must begin on the day after the act or event. (For example, if your RAP specifies that you must close a staging pile within 180 days after the operating term for that staging pile expires, and the operating term expires on June 1, then June 2 counts as day one of your 180 days, and you would have to complete closure by November 28.)
                (b) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an act or event must be computed so that the period ends on the day before the act or event. (For example, if you are transferring ownership or operational control of your site, and wish to transfer your RAP, the new owner or operator must submit a revised RAP application no later than 90 days before the scheduled change. Therefore, if you plan to change ownership on January 1, the new owner/operator must submit the revised RAP application no later than October 3, so that the 90th day would be December 31.)

                (c) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the time period must be extended to the next working day. (For example, if you wish to appeal the Director's decision to modify your RAP, then you must petition the Environmental Appeals Board within 30 days after the Director has issued the final RAP decision. If the 30th day falls on Sunday, then you may submit your appeal by the Monday after. If the 30th day falls on July 4th, then you may submit your appeal by July 5th.)
                
                (d) Whenever a party or interested person has the right to or is required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other paper upon him by mail, 3 days must be added to the prescribed term. (For example, if you wish to appeal the Director's decision to modify your RAP, then you must petition the Environmental Appeals Board within 30 days after the Director has issued the final RAP decision. However, if the Director notifies you of his decision by mail, then you may have 33 days to petition the Environmental Appeals Board.)
              
              
                § 270.220
                How may I transfer my RAP to a new owner or operator?
                (a) If you wish to transfer your RAP to a new owner or operator, you must follow the requirements specified in your RAP for RAP modification to identify the new owner or operator, and incorporate any other necessary requirements. These modifications do not constitute “significant” modifications for purposes of § 270.170. The new owner/operator must submit a revised RAP application no later than 90 days before the scheduled change along with a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of RAP responsibility between you and the new permittees.
                (b) When a transfer of ownership or operational control occurs, you as the old owner or operator must comply with the applicable requirements in part 264, subpart H (Financial Requirements), of this chapter until the new owner or operator has demonstrated that he is complying with the requirements in that subpart. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with part 264, subpart H, of this chapter within six months of the date of the change in ownership or operational control of the facility or remediation waste management site. When the new owner/operator demonstrates compliance with part 264, subpart H, of this chapter to the Director, the Director will notify you that you no longer need to comply with part 264, subpart H, of this chapter as of the date of demonstration.
              
              
                § 270.225
                What must the State or EPA Region report about noncompliance with RAPs?
                The State or EPA Region must report noncompliance with RAPs according to the provisions of § 270.5.
              
            
            
              Obtaining a RAP for an Off-Site Location
              
                § 270.230
                May I perform remediation waste management activities under a RAP at a location removed from the area where the remediation wastes originated?
                (a) You may request a RAP for remediation waste management activities at a location removed from the area where the remediation wastes originated if you believe such a location would be more protective than the contaminated area or areas in close proximity.
                (b) If the Director determines that an alternative location, removed from the area where the remediation waste originated, is more protective than managing remediation waste at the area of contamination or areas in close proximity, then the Director may approve a RAP for this alternative location.
                (c) You must request the RAP, and the Director will approve or deny the RAP, according to the procedures and requirements in this subpart.
                (d) A RAP for an alternative location must also meet the following requirements, which the Director must include in the RAP for such locations:

                (1) The RAP for the alternative location must be issued to the person responsible for the cleanup from which the remediation wastes originated;
                
                (2) The RAP is subject to the expanded public participation requirements in §§ 124.31, 124.32, and 124.33 of this chapter;
                (3) The RAP is subject to the public notice requirements in § 124.10(c) of this chapter;

                (4) The site permitted in the RAP may not be located within 61 meters or 200 feet of a fault which has had displacement in the Holocene time (you must demonstrate compliance with this standard through the requirements in § 270.14(b)(11)) (See definitions of terms in § 264.18(a) of this chapter);
                
                
                  Note to paragraph (d)(4):
                  Sites located in political jurisdictions other than those listed in Appendix VI of part 264 of this chapter, are assumed to be in compliance with this requirement.
                
                
                (e) These alternative locations are remediation waste management sites, and retain the following benefits of remediation waste management sites:
                (1) Exclusion from facility-wide corrective action under § 264.101 of this chapter; and
                (2) Application of § 264.1(j) of this chapter in lieu of part 264, subparts B, C, and D, of this chapter.

            Subpart A—Requirements for Final Authorization
            
              § 271.1
              Purpose and scope.
              (a) This subpart specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising, and withdrawing approval of State programs and the requirements State programs must meet to be approved by the Administrator under sections 3006(b), (f) and (h) of RCRA.
              (b) State submissions for program approval must be made in accordance with the procedures set out in this subpart.

              (c) The substantive provisions which must be included in State programs for them to be approved include requirements for permitting, compliance evaluation, enforcement, public participation, and sharing of information. Many of the requirements for State programs are made applicable to States by cross-referencing other EPA regulations. In particular, many of the provisions of parts 270 and 124 are made applicable to States by the references contained in § 271.14.
              (d) Upon receipt of a complete submission, EPA will conduct a public hearing, if interest is shown, and determine whether to approve or disapprove the program taking into consideration the requirements of this subpart, the Act and any comments received.
              (e) The Administrator shall approve State programs which conform to the applicable requirements of this subpart.
              (f) Except as provided in § 271.3(a)(3), upon approval of a State permitting program, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of Federal permits for those activities subject to the approved State program.
              (g) Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.

              (h) Partial State programs are not allowed for programs operating under RCRA final authorization. However, in many cases States will lack authority to regulate activities on Indian lands. This lack of authority does not impair a State's ability to obtain full program approval in accordance with this subpart, i.e., inability of a State to regulate activities on Indian lands does not constitute a partial program. EPA will administer the program on Indian lands if the State does not seek this authority.
              
              
                Note:
                States are advised to contact the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, concerning authority over Indian lands.
              
              
              (i) Except as provided in § 271.4, nothing in this subpart precludes a State from:
              (1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this subpart;
              (2) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this subpart. Where an approved State program has a greater scope of coverage than required by Federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the Federally approved program.
              (j) Requirements and prohibitions which are applicable to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste and which are imposed pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) include any requirement or prohibition which has taken effect under HSWA, such as:
              (1) All regulations specified in Table 1, and

              (2) The self-implementing statutory provisions specified in Table 2 that have taken effect.
              
              
                Note:
                See §§ 264.1(f)(3), 265.1(c)(4)(ii), 271.3(b), 271.21(e)(2) and 271.121(c)(3) for applicability.

              § 271.3
              Availability of final authorization.
              (a) Where a State program meets the requirements of section 3006 of RCRA and this subpart it may receive authorization for any provision of its program corresponding to a Federal provision in effect on the date of the State's authorization.
              (b) States approved under this subpart are authorized to administer and enforce their hazardous waste program in lieu of the Federal program, except as provided below:
              (1) Any requirement or prohibition which is applicable to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste and which is imposed pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 takes effect in each State having a finally authorized State program on the same date as such requirement takes effect in other States. These requirements and prohibitions are identified in § 271.1(j).
              (2) The requirements and prohibitions in § 271.1(j) supersede any less stringent provision of a State program. The Administrator is authorized to carry out each such Federal requirement and prohibition in an authorized State except where, pursuant to section 3006(b) or 3006(g)(2) of RCRA, the State has received final or interim authorization to carry out the particular requirement or prohibition. Violations of Federal requirements and prohibitions effective in authorized States are enforceable under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.
              (3) Until an authorized State program is revised to reflect the amendments made by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 and such program revisions receive final or interim authorization pursuant to section 3006(b) or 3006(g)(2) of RCRA, the Administrator shall have the authority in such State to issue or deny permits or those portions of permits affected by the requirements and prohibitions established by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.
              (4) Any requirement imposed under the authority of the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act:

              (i) Shall take effect in each State having a finally authorized State program on the same date as such requirement takes effect in other States;
              
              (ii) Shall supersede any less stringent or inconsistent provision of a State program; and
              (iii) Shall be carried out by the Administrator in an authorized state except where, pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, the State has received final authorization to carry out the requirement in lieu of the Administrator.
              (c) Official State applications for final authorization may be reviewed on the basis of Federal self-implementing statutory provisions that were in effect 12 months prior to the State's submission of its official application (if no implementing regulations have previously been promulgated) and the regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260-266, 268, 270 and 271 that were in effect 12 months prior to the State's submission of its official application. To meet this requirement the State may demonstrate that its program qualifies for final authorization pursuant to this subpart or interim authorization under § 271.24. States are not precluded from seeking authorization for requirements taking effect less than 12 months prior to the State's submittal of its final application.

              § 271.4
              Consistency.
              To obtain approval, a State program must be consistent with the Federal program and State programs applicable in other States and in particular must comply with the provisions below. For purposes of this section the phrase “State programs applicable in other States” refers only to those State hazardous waste programs which have received final authorization under this part.
              (a) Any aspect of the State program which unreasonably restricts, impedes, or operates as a ban on the free movement across the State border of hazardous wastes from or to other States for treatment, storage, or disposal at facilities authorized to operate under the Federal or an approved State program shall be deemed inconsistent.
              (b) Any aspect of State law or of the State program which has no basis in human health or environmental protection and which acts as a prohibition on the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste in the State may be deemed inconsistent.
              (c) If the state manifest system does not meet the requirements of this part, the state program shall be deemed inconsistent. The state manifest system must further allow the use and recognize the validity of electronic manifests as described in § 260.10 of this chapter.

              § 271.5
              Elements of a program submission.
              (a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part shall submit to the Administrator at least three copies of a program submission. The submission shall contain the following:
              (1) A letter from the Governor of the State requesting program approval;
              (2) A complete program description, as required by § 271.6 describing how the State intends to carry out its responsibilities under this subpart;
              (3) An Attorney General's statement as required by § 271.7;
              (4) A Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator as required by § 271.8;
              (5) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations, including those governing State administrative procedures; and
              (6) The showing required by § 271.20(c) of the State's public participation activities prior to program submission.

              (b) Within 30 days of receipt by EPA of a State program submission, EPA will notify the State whether its submission is complete. If EPA finds that a State's submission is complete, the statutory review period (i.e., the period of time allotted for formal EPA review of a proposed State program under section 3006(b) of the Act) shall be deemed to have begun on the date of receipt of the State's submission. If EPA finds that a State's submission is incomplete, the review period shall not begin until all necessary information is received by EPA.

              (c) If the State's submission is materially changed during the review period, the review period shall begin again upon receipt of the revised submission.
              (d) The State and EPA may extend the review period by agreement.
            
            
              § 271.6
              Program description.
              Any State that seeks to administer a program under this subpart shall submit a description of the program it proposes to administer in lieu of the Federal program under State law or under an interstate compact. The program description shall include:
              (a) A description in narrative form of the scope, structure, coverage and processes of the State program.
              (b) A description (including organization charts) of the organization and structure of the State agency or agencies which will have responsibility for administering the program, including the information listed below. If more than one agency is responsible for administration of a program, each agency must have statewide jurisdiction over a class of activities. The responsibilities of each agency must be delineated, their procedures for coordination set forth, and an agency must be designated as a “lead agency” to facilitate communications between EPA and the State agencies having program responsibilities. When the State proposes to administer a program of greater scope of coverage than is required by Federal law, the information provided under this paragraph shall indicate the resources dedicated to administering the Federally required portion of the program.
              (1) A description of the State agency staff who will carry out the State program, including the number, occupations, and general duties of the employees. The State need not submit complete job descriptions for every employee carrying out the State program.
              (2) An itemization of the estimated costs of establishing and administering the program, including cost of the personnel listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, cost of administrative support, and cost of technical support. This estimate must cover the first two years after program approval.
              (3) An itemization of the sources and amounts of funding, including an estimate of Federal grant money, available to the State Director to meet the costs listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, identifying any restrictions or limitations upon this funding. This estimate must cover the first two years after program approval.
              (c) A description of applicable State procedures, including permitting procedures and any State administrative or judicial review procedures.
              (d) Copies of the permit form(s), application form(s), and reporting form(s) the State intends to employ in its program. Forms used by the State for hazardous waste management need not be identical to the forms used by EPA but should require the same basic information, except that the State RCRA program must require the use of EPA Manifest Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A. Where the State preprints information on the Manifest forms, such forms must be submitted with the State's application for approval. Restrictions on preprinting by the States are identified in 40 CFR 271.10(h). Otherwise, the State need not provide copies of uniform national forms it intends to use but should note its intention to use such forms.
              (e) A complete description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program.
              (f) A description of the State manifest tracking system, and of the procedures the State will use to coordinate information with other approved State programs and the Federal program regarding interstate and international shipments.
              (g) An estimate of the number of the following:
              (1) Generators;
              (2) Transporters; and
              (3) On- and off-site storage, treatment and disposal facilities, and a brief description of the types of facilities and an indication of the permit status of these facilities.
              (h) If available, an estimate of the annual quantities of hazardous wastes generated within the State; transported into and out of the State; and stored, treated, or disposed of within the State: On-site; and Off-site.

              § 271.7
              Attorney General's statement.

              (a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this subpart shall submit a statement from the State Attorney General (or the attorney for those State agencies which have independent legal counsel) that the laws of the State provide adequate authority to carry out the program described under § 271.6 and to meet the requirements of this subpart. This statement shall include citations to the specific statutes, administrative regulations and, where appropriate, judicial decisions which demonstrate adequate authority. State statutes and regulations cited by the State Attorney General or independent legal counsel shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State statutes and regulations at the time the statement is signed and shall be fully effective by the time the program is approved. To qualify as “independent legal counsel” the attorney signing the statement required by this section must have full authority to independently represent the State agency in court on all matters pertaining to the State program.
              
              
                Note:
                EPA will supply States with an Attorney General's statement format on request.
              
              
              (b) When a State seeks authority over activities on Indian lands, the statement shall contain an appropriate analysis of the State's authority.
            
            
              § 271.8
              Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator.
              (a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this subpart shall submit a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The Memorandum of Agreement shall be executed by the State Director and the Regional Administrator and shall become effective when approved by the Administrator. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Memorandum of Agreement may include other terms, conditions, or agreements consistent with this subpart and relevant to the administration and enforcement of the State's regulatory program. The Administrator shall not approve any Memorandum of Agreement which contains provisions which restrict EPA's statutory oversight responsibility.
              (b) All Memoranda of Agreement shall include the following:
              (1) Provisions for the Regional Administrator to promptly forward to the State Director information obtained prior to program approval in notifications provided under section 3010(a) of RCRA. The Regional Administrator and the State Director shall agree on procedures for the assignment of EPA identification numbers for new generators, transporters, treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.
              (2) Provisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to EPA. The State shall allow EPA to routinely review State records, reports, and files relevant to the administration and enforcement of the approved program. State reports may be combined with grant reports where appropriate.
              (3) Provisions on the State's compliance monitoring and enforcement program, including:
              (i) Provisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA. These may specify the basis on which the Regional Administrator will select facilities or activities within the State for EPA inspection. The Regional Administrator will normally notify the State at least 7 days before any such inspection; and
              (ii) Procedures to assure coordination of enforcement activities.
              (4) Provisions allowing EPA to conduct compliance inspections of all generators, transporters, and HWM facilities in each year for which the State is operating under final authorization. The Regional Administrator and the State Director may agree to limitations on compliance inspections of generators, transporters, and non-major HWM facilities.

              (5) No limitations on EPA compliance inspections of generators, transporters, or non-major HWM facilities under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall restrict EPA's right to inspect any generator, transporter, or HWM facility which it has cause to believe is not in compliance with RCRA; however, before conducting such an inspection, EPA will normally allow the State a reasonable opportunity to conduct a compliance evaluation inspection.

              (6) Provisions for the prompt transfer from EPA to the State of pending permit applications and any other information relevant to program operation not already in the possession of the State Director (e.g., support files for permit issuance, compliance reports, etc.). When existing permits are transferred from EPA to the State for administration, the Memorandum of Agreement shall contain provisions specifying a procedure for transferring the administration of these permits. If a State lacks the authority to directly administer permits issued by the Federal government, a procedure may be established to transfer responsibility for these permits.
              
              
                Note:
                For example, EPA and the State and the permittee could agree that the State would issue a permit(s) identical to the outstanding Federal permit which would simultaneously be terminated.
              
              
              (7) Provisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits, and proposed permits that the State will send to the Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection.

              (8) When appropriate, provisions for joint processing of permits by the State and EPA, for facilities or activities which require permits from both EPA and the State under different programs. See § 124.4
              
              
                Note:
                To promote efficiency and to avoid duplication and inconsistency, States are encouraged to enter into joint processing agreements with EPA for permit issuance.
              
              
              (9) Provisions for the State Director to promptly forward to EPA copies of draft permits and permit applications for all major HWM facilities for review and comment. The Regional Administrator and the State Director may agree to limitations regarding review of and comment on draft permits and/or permit applications for non-major HWM facilities. The State Director shall supply EPA copies of final permits for all major HWM facilities.
              (10) Provisions for the State Director to review all permits issued under State law prior to the date of program approval and modify or revoke and reissue them to require compliance with the requirements of this subpart. The Regional Administrator and the State Director shall establish a time within which this review must take place.
              (11) Provisions for modification of the Memorandum of Agreement in accordance with this subpart.

              (c) The Memorandum of Agreement, the annual program grant and the State/EPA Agreement should be consistent. If the State/EPA Agreement indicates that a change is needed in the Memorandum of Agreement, the Memorandum of Agreement may be amended through the procedures set forth in this subpart. The State/EPA Agreement may not override the Memorandum of Agreement.
              
              
                Note:
                Detailed program priorities and specific arrangements for EPA support of the State program will change and are therefore more appropriately negotiated in the context of annual agreements rather than in the MOA. However, it may still be appropriate to specify in the MOA the basis for such detailed agreements, e.g., a provision in the MOA specifying that EPA will select facilities in the State for inspection annually as part of the State/EPA agreement.
              
            
            
              § 271.9
              Requirements for identification and listing of hazardous wastes.
              (a) The State program must control all the hazardous wastes controlled under 40 CFR part 261 and must adopt a list of hazardous wastes and set of characteristics for identifying hazardous wastes equivalent to those under 40 CFR part 261.
              (b) The State is not required to have a delisting mechanism. A State may receive authorization for delisting if the State regulations for delisting decisions are equivalent to § 260.20(b) and § 260.22, and the State provides public notice and opportunity for comment before granting or denying delisting requests.

              § 271.10
              Requirements for generators of hazardous wastes.

              (a) The State program must cover all generators covered by 40 CFR part 262. States must require new generators to contact the State and obtain an EPA identification number before they perform any activity subject to regulation under the approved State hazardous waste program.
              (b) The State shall have authority to require and shall require all generators to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements equivalent to those under 40 CFR 262.40 and 262.41. States must require that generators keep these records at least 3 years. States that choose to receive electronic documents must include the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3—(Electronic reporting) in their Program (except that states that choose to receive electronic manifests and/or permit the use of electronic manifests must comply with any applicable requirements for e-manifest in this section of this section).
              (c) The State program must require that generators who accumulate hazardous wastes for short periods of time comply with requirements that are equivalent to the requirements for accumulating hazardous wastes for short periods of time under 40 CFR 262.16 or 262.17.
              (d) The State program must require that generators comply with requirements that are equivalent to the requirements for the packaging, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous waste under 40 CFR 262.30 to 262.33, and are consistent with relevant DOT regulations under 49 CFR parts 172, 173, 178 and 179.
              (e) The State program shall provide requirements respecting international shipments which are equivalent to those at 40 CFR part 262 subpart H, other hazardous waste import and export regulations in 40 CFR parts 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267 and 273, and exclusion conditions for export or import in 40 CFR part 261 to the extent that State has adopted such exclusion conditions, except that States shall not replace EPA or international references with State references.
              (f) The State must require that all generators of hazardous waste who transport (or offer for transport) such hazardous waste off-site:
              (1) Use a manifest system that ensures that interstate and intrastate shipments of hazardous waste are designated for delivery and, in the case of intrastate shipments, are delivered to facilities that are authorized to operate under an approved state program or the federal program. The manifest system must require the use of the paper or electronic manifest formats as required by § 262.20(a) of this chapter. No other manifest form, electronic manifest format, shipping paper, or information other than that required by federal requirements, may be required by the state to travel with the shipment, or to be transmitted electronically, as a means to track the transportation and delivery of hazardous waste shipments. No other electronic signature other than that required by the federal electronic manifest requirements may be required by a state to be executed in connection with the signing of an electronic manifest.
              (2) Initiate the manifest and designate on the manifest the treatment, storage or disposal facility to which the waste is to be shipped.
              (3) Ensure that all wastes offered for transportation are accompanied by a manifest form, or are tracked with an electronic manifest, except:
              (i) Shipments subject to 40 CFR 262.20(e) or (f);
              (ii) Shipments by rail or water, as specified in 40 CFR 262.23(c) and (d).
              (4) Investigate instances where manifests have not been returned by the owner or operator of the designated facility and report such instances to the State in which the shipment originated.
              (g) In the case of interstate shipments for which the manifest has not been returned, the State program must provide for notification to the State in which the facility designated on the manifest is located and to the State in which the shipment may have been delivered (or to EPA in the case of unauthorized States).
              (h) The state must follow the federal manifest format for the paper manifest forms (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A) and their instructions and must follow the federal electronic manifest format and instructions as obtained from the Electronic Manifest System described in § 260.10 of this chapter.

              (1) A state may require the entry of waste codes associated with particular wastes that are regulated as hazardous wastes by the state, if the state codes are not redundant with a federally required code for the same waste. No state, however, may impose enforcement sanctions on a transporter during transportation of the shipment for failure of the form to include a state-required waste code.
              (2) Either the State to which a shipment is manifested (consignment State) or the State in which the generator is located (generator State), or both, may require that copies of the manifest form be submitted to the State.
              (3) No State, however, may impose enforcement sanctions on a transporter during transportation of the shipment for failure of the form to include preprinted information or optional State information items.
              (i) Unless otherwise provided in part 271, the State program shall have standards for generators which are at least as stringent as any amendment to 40 CFR Part 262 which is promulgated after July 1, 1984.

              § 271.11
              Requirements for transporters of hazardous wastes.
              (a) The State program must cover all transporters covered by 40 CFR part 263. New transporters must be required to contact the State and obtain an EPA identification number from the State before they accept hazardous waste for transport.
              (b) The State shall have authority to require and shall require all transporters to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements equivalent to those under 40 CFR 263.22. States must require that transporters keep these records at least 3 years. States that choose to receive electronic documents must include the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3—(Electronic reporting) in their Program (except that states that choose to receive electronic manifests and/or permit the use of electronic manifests must comply with any applicable requirements for e-manifest in this section of this section).
              (c)(1) The state must require the transporter to carry the manifest forms (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A) during transport, or, where the electronic manifest is used and the U. S. Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Regulations, 49 CFR parts 171-180, require a paper shipping document on the transport vehicle, to carry one printed copy of the electronic manifest during transport, except in the case of shipments by rail or water, for which transporters may carry a shipping paper as specified in 40 CFR 263.20(e) and (f).
              (2) The State must require the transporter to deliver waste only to the facility designated on the manifest, which in the case of return shipments of rejected wastes or regulated container residues, may also include the original generator of the waste shipment.
              (3) The State program must provide requirements for shipments by rail or water equivalent to those under 40 CFR 263.20(e) and (f).

              (4) For exports of hazardous waste, the state must require the transporter to refuse to accept hazardous waste for export if the exporter has not provided: A manifest listing the consent numbers for the hazardous waste shipment; a movement document for shipments occurring under consents issued by EPA on or after December 31, 2016; and on or after the AES filing compliance date, the ITN number for the hazardous waste shipment. The state must further require the transporter to carry a movement document and manifest with the shipment, as required; to sign and date the International Shipments Block of the manifest to indicate the date the shipment leaves the U.S.; to carry paper documentation of consent (i.e., Acknowledgement of Consent, movement document) with the shipment and to give a copy of the manifest to the U.S. customs official at the point of departure if instructed by mail, email or fax by the exporter to do so; and to send a copy of the manifest, if in paper form, to the e-Manifest system using the allowable methods listed in 40 CFR 264.71(a)(2)(v).

              (d) For hazardous wastes that are discharged in transit, the State program must require that transporters notify appropriate State, local, and Federal agencies of such discharges, and clean up such wastes, or take action so that such wastes do not present a hazard to human health or the environment. These requirements shall be equivalent to those found at 40 CFR 263.30 and 263.31.
              (e) Unless otherwise provided in part 271, the State program shall have standards for transporters which are at least as stringent as any amendment to 40 CFR Part 263 which is promulgated after July 1, 1984.

              Requirements with respect to permits and permit applications.

              (a) State law must require permits for owners and operators of all hazardous waste management facilities required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 270 and prohibit the operation of any hazardous waste management facility without such a permit, except that States may, if adequate legal authority exists, authorize owners and operators of any facility which would qualify for interim status under the Federal program to remain in operation until a final decision is made on the permit application, or until interim status terminates pursuant to 40 CFR 270.73 (b) through (f). When State law authorizes such continued operation it shall require compliance by owners and operators of such facilities with standards at least as stringent as EPA's interim status standards at 40 CFR part 265.
              (b) The State must require all new HWM facilities to contact the State and obtain an EPA identification number before commencing treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.
              (c) All permits issued by the State shall require compliance with the standards adopted by the State under § 271.12.

                States need not implement provisions identical to the above listed provisions. Implemented provisions must, however, establish requirements at least as stringent as the corresponding listed provisions. While States may impose more stringent requirements, they may not make one requirement more lenient as a tradeoff for making another requirement more stringent; for example, by requiring that public hearings be held prior to issuing any permit while reducing the amount of advance notice of such a hearing.

              § 271.15
              Requirements for compliance evaluation programs.
              (a) State programs shall have procedures for receipt, evaluation, retention and investigation for possible enforcement of all notices and reports required of permittees and other regulated persons (and for investigation for possible enforcement of failure to submit these notices and reports).

              (b) State programs shall have inspection and surveillance procedures to determine, independent of information supplied by regulated persons, compliance or noncompliance with applicable program requirements. The State shall maintain:
              (1) A program which is capable of making comprehensive surveys of all facilities and activities subject to the State Director's authority to identify persons subject to regulation who have failed to comply with permit application or other program requirements. Any compilation, index, or inventory of such facilities and activities shall be made available to the Regional Administrator upon request;
              (2) A program for periodic inspections of the facilities and activities subject to regulation. These inspections shall be conducted in a manner designed to:
              (i) Determine compliance or noncompliance with issued permit conditions and other program requirements;
              (ii) Verify the accuracy of information submitted by permittees and other regulated persons in reporting forms and other forms supplying monitoring data; and
              (iii) Verify the adequacy of sampling, monitoring, and other methods used by permittees and other regulated persons to develop that information;
              (3) A program for investigating information obtained regarding violations of applicable program and permit requirements; and
              (4) Procedures for receiving and ensuring proper consideration of information submitted by the public about violations. Public effort in reporting violations shall be encouraged, and the State Director shall make available information on reporting procedures.
              (c) The State Director and State officers engaged in compliance evaluation shall have authority to enter any site or premises subject to regulation or in which records relevant to program operation are kept in order to copy any records, inspect, monitor or otherwise investigate compliance with the State program including compliance with permit conditions and other program requirements. States whose law requires a search warrant before entry conform with this requirement.
              (d) Investigatory inspections shall be conducted, samples shall be taken and other information shall be gathered in a manner (e.g., using proper “chain of custody” procedures) that will produce evidence admissible in an enforcement proceeding or in court.
            
            
              § 271.16
              Requirements for enforcement authority.
              (a) Any State agency administering a program shall have available the following remedies for violations of State program requirements:

              (1) To restrain immediately and effectively any person by order or by suit in State court from engaging in any unauthorized activity which is endangering or causing damage to public health or the environment.
              
              
                Note:
                This paragraph requires that States have a mechanism (e.g., an administrative cease and desist order or the ability to seek a temporary restraining order) to stop any unauthorized activity endangering public health or the environment.
              
              
              (2) To sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any threatened or continuing violation of any program requirement, including permit conditions, without the necessity of a prior revocation of the permit;
              (3) To access or sue to recover in court civil penalties and to seek criminal remedies, including fines, as follows:
              (i) Civil penalties shall be recoverable for any program violation in at least the amount of $10,000 per day.

              (ii) Criminal remedies shall be obtainable against any person who knowingly transports any hazardous waste to an unpermitted facility; who treats, stores, or disposes of hazardous waste without a permit; who knowingly transports, treats, stores, disposes, recycles, causes to be transported, or otherwise handles any used oil regulated by EPA under section 3014 of RCRA that is not listed or identified as a hazardous waste under the state's hazardous waste program in violation of standards or regulations for management of such used oil; or who makes any false statement, or representation in any application, label, manifest, record, report, permit or other document filed, maintained, or used for purposes of program compliance (including compliance with any standards or regulations for used oil regulated by EPA under section 3014 of RCRA that is not listed or identified as hazardous waste). Criminal fines shall be recoverable in at least the amount of $10,000 per day for each violation, and imprisonment for at least six months shall be available.
              (b)(1) The maximum civil penalty or criminal fines (as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) shall be assessable for each instance of violation and, if the violation is continuous, shall be assessable up to the maximum amount for each day of violation.

              (2) The burden of proof and degree of knowledge or intent required under State law for establishing violations under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, shall be no greater than the burden of proof or degree of knowledge or intent EPA must provide when it brings an action under the Act.
              
              
                Note:
                For example, this requirement is not met if State law includes mental state as an element of proof for civil violations.
              
              

              (c) A civil penalty assessed, sought, or agreed upon by the State Director under paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be appropriate to the violation.
              
              
                Note:
                To the extent the State judgments or settlements provide penalties in amounts which EPA believes to be substantially inadequate in comparison to the amounts which EPA would require under similar facts, EPA, when authorized by the applicable statute, may commence separate actions for penalties.
                In addition to the requirements of this paragraph, the State may have other enforcement remedies. The following enforcement options, while not mandatory, are highly recommended:
                Procedures for assessment by the State of the costs of investigations, inspections, or monitoring surveys which lead to the establishment of violations;
                Procedures which enable the State to assess or to sue any persons responsible for unauthorized activities for any expenses incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating any adverse effects upon human health and the environment resulting from the unauthorized activity, whether or not accidental;
                Procedures which enable the State to sue for compensation for any loss or destruction of wildlife, fish or aquatic life, or their habitat, and for any other damages caused by unauthorized activity, either to the State or to any residents of the State who are directly aggrieved by the unauthorized activity, or both; and
                Procedures for the administrative assessment of penalties by the Director.
              
              
              (d) Any State administering a program under this subpart shall provide for public participation in the State enforcement process by providing either:
              (1) Authority which allows intervention as of right in any civil action to obtain the remedies specified in paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section by any citizen having an interest which is or may be adversely affected; or
              (2)(i) Assurance by the appropriate State agency that it will investigate and provide written responses to all citizen complaints submitted pursuant to the procedures specified in § 271.15(b)(4);
              (ii) Assurance by the appropriate State enforcement authority that it will not oppose intervention by any citizen when permissive intervention is authorized by statute, rule, or regulation; and
              (iii) Assurance by the appropriate State enforcement authority that it will publish notice of and provide at least 30 days for public comment on all proposed settlements of civil enforcement actions, except in cases where a settlement requires some immediate action (e.g., cleanup) which if otherwise delayed could result in substantial damage to either public health or the environment.
              (e) Any State authority used to issue an enforceable document either in lieu of a post-closure permit as provided in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7), or as a source of alternative requirements for regulated units, as provided under 40 CFR 264.90(f), 264.110(c), 264.140(d), 265.90(d), 265.110(d), and 265.140(d), shall have available the following remedies:
              (1) Authority to sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any threatened or continuing violation of the requirements of such documents, as well as authority to compel compliance with requirements for corrective action or other emergency response measures deemed necessary to protect human health and the environment; and

              (2) Authority to access or sue to recover in court civil penalties, including fines, for violations of requirements in such documents.

              Sharing of information.
              (a) Any information obtained or used in the administration of a State program shall be available to EPA upon request without restriction. If the information has been submitted to the State under a claim of confidentiality, the State must submit that claim to EPA when providing information under this subpart. Any information obtained from a State and subject to a claim of confidentiality will be treated in accordance with the regulations in 40 CFR part 2. If EPA obtains from a State information that is not claimed to be confidential, EPA may make that information available to the public without further notice.
              (b) EPA shall furnish to States with approved programs the information in its files not submitted under a claim of confidentiality which the State needs to implement its approved program. EPA shall furnish to States with approved programs information submitted to EPA under a claim of confidentiality, which the State needs to implement its approved program, subject to the conditions in 40 CFR part 2.
              (c)(1) The State program must provide for the public availability of information obtained by the State regarding facilities and sites for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. Such information must be made available to the public in substantially the same manner, and to the same degree, as would be the case if the Administrator was carrying out the provisions of Subtitle C of RCRA in the State.
              (2) A State must revise its program to comply with this section in accordance with § 271.21(e)(2)(ii). Interim authorization under § 271.24 is not available to demonstrate compliance with this section.

              (b) The State Director of any approved program which may affect the planning for and development of hazardous waste management facilities and practices shall consult and coordinate with agencies designated under section 4006(b) of RCRA (40 CFR part 255) as responsible for the development and implementation of State solid waste management plans under section 4002(b) of RCRA (40 CFR part 256).

              (a) The Regional Administrator may comment on permit applications and draft permits as provided in the Memorandum of Agreement under § 271.8.
              (b) Where EPA indicates, in a comment, that issuance of the permit would be inconsistent with the approved State program, EPA shall include in the comment:
              (1) A statement of the reasons for the comment (including the section of RCRA or regulations promulgated thereunder that support the comment); and
              (2) The actions that should be taken by the State Director in order to address the comments (including the conditions which the permit would include if it were issued by the Regional Administrator).
              (c) A copy of any comment shall be sent to the permit applicant by the Regional Administrator.
              (d) The Regional Administrator shall withdraw such a comment when satisfied that the State has met or refuted his or her concerns.

              (e) Under section 3008(a)(3) of RCRA, EPA may terminate a State-issued permit or bring an enforcement action in accordance with the procedures of 40 CFR part 22 in the case of a violation of a State program requirement. In exercising these authorities, EPA will observe the following conditions:
              (1) The Regional Administrator may take action under section 3008(a)(3) of RCRA against a holder of a State-issued permit at any time on the ground that the permittee is not complying with a condition of that permit.
              (2) The Regional Administrator may take action under section 3008(a)(3) of RCRA against a holder of a State-issued permit at any time on the ground that the permittee is not complying with a condition that the Regional Administrator in commenting on the permit application or draft permit stated was necessary to implement approved State program requirements, whether or not that condition was included in the final permit.
              (3) The Regional Administrator may not take action under section 3008(a)(3) of RCRA against a holder of a State-issued permit on the ground that the permittee is not complying with a condition necessary to implement approved State program requirements unless the Regional Administrator stated in commenting on the permit application or draft permit that the condition was necessary.
              (4) The Regional Administrator may take action under section 7003 of RCRA against a permit holder at any time whether or not the permit holder is complying with permit conditions.
              (f) Notwithstanding the above provisions, EPA shall issue permits, or portions of permits, to facilities in authorized States as necessary to implement the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.

              § 271.20
              Approval process.
              (a) Prior to submitting an application to EPA for approval of a State program, the State shall issue public notice of its intent to seek program approval from EPA. This public notice shall:
              (1) Be circulated in a manner calculated to attract the attention of interested persons including:
              (i) Publication in enough of the largest newspapers in the State to attract statewide attention; and
              (ii) Mailing to persons on the State agency mailing list and to any other persons whom the agency has reason to believe are interested;
              (2) Indicate when and where the State's proposed submission may be reviewed by the public;
              (3) Indicate the cost of obtaining a copy of the submission;
              (4) Provide for a comment period of not less than 30 days during which time interested members of the public may express their views on the proposed program;
              (5) Provide that a public hearing will be held by the State or EPA if sufficient public interest is shown or, alternatively, schedule such a public hearing. Any public hearing to be held by the State on its application for authorization shall be scheduled no earlier than 30 days after the notice of hearing is published;
              (6) Briefly outline the fundamental aspects of the State program; and
              (7) Identify a person that an interested member of the public may contact with any questions.
              (b) If the proposed State program is substantially modified after the public comment period provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the State shall, prior to submitting its program to the Administrator, provide an opportunity for further public comment in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (a) of this section. Provided, that the opportunity for further public comment may be limited to those portions of the State's application which have been changed since the prior public notice.

              (c) After complying with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the State may submit, in accordance with § 271.5, a proposed program to EPA for approval. Such formal submission may only be made after the date of promulgation of the last component of Phase II. The program submission shall include copies of all written comments received by the State, a transcript, recording, or summary of any public hearing which was held by the State, and a responsiveness summary which identifies the public participation activities conducted, describes the matters presented to the public, summarizes significant comments received and responds to these comments.

              (d) Within 90 days from the date of receipt of a complete program submission for final authorization, the Administrator shall make a tentative determination as to whether or not he expects to grant authorization to the State program. If the Administrator indicates that he may not approve the State program he shall include a general statement of his areas of concern. The Administrator shall give notice of this tentative determination in the Federal Register and in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Notice of the tentative determination of authorization shall also:
              (1) Indicate that a public hearing will be held by EPA no earlier than 30 days after notice of the tentative determination of authorization. The notice may require persons wishing to present testimony to file a request with the Regional Administrator, who may cancel the public hearing if sufficient public interest in a hearing is not expressed.
              (2) Afford the public 30 days after the notice to comment on the State's submission and the tentative determination; and
              (3) Note the availability of the State submission for inspection and copying by the public.

              (e) Within 90 days of the notice given pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator shall make a final determination whether or not to approve the State's program, taking into account any comments submitted. The Administrator shall give notice of this final determination in the Federal Register and in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The notification shall include a concise statement of the reasons for this determination, and a response to significant comments received.

              § 271.21
              Procedures for revision of State programs.
              (a) Either EPA or the approved State may initiate program revision. Program revision may be necessary when the controlling Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented. The State shall keep EPA fully informed of any proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory authority, its forms, procedures, or priorities.
              (b) Revision of a State program shall be accomplished as follows:
              (1) The State shall submit a modified program description, Attorney General's statement, Memorandum of Agreement, or such other documents as EPA determines to be necessary under the circumstances.
              (2) The Administrator shall approve or disapprove program revisions based on the requirements of this part and of the Act. In approving or disapproving program revisions, the Administrator shall follow the procedures of paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section.
              (3) The procedures for an immediate final publication of the Administrator's decision are as follows:
              (i) The Administrator shall issue public notice of his approval or disapproval of a State program revision:
              (A) In the Federal Register;
              
              (B) In enough of the largest newspapers in the State to attract Statewide attention; and
              (C) By mailing to persons on the State agency mailing list and to any other persons whom the agency has reason to believe are interested.
              (ii) The public notice shall summarize the State program revision, indicate whether EPA intends to approve or disapprove the revision and provide for an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days.

              (iii) Approval or disapproval of a State program revision shall become effective 60 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State revision discussed in the notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received the Administrator shall so notify the State and shall, within 60 days after the date of publication, publish in the Federal Register either:
              (A) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or
              (B) A notice containing a response to comments and which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.
              (4) The procedures for proposed and final publication of the Administrator's decision are as follows:
              (i) The Administrator shall issue public notice of his proposed approval or disapproval of a State program revision:
              (A) In the Federal Register;
              
              (B) In enough of the largest newspapers in the State to attract Statewide attention; and
              (C) By mailing to persons on the State agency mailing list and to any other persons whom the agency has reason to believe are interested.
              (ii) The public notice shall summarize the State program revision, indicate whether EPA intends to approve or disapprove the revision and provide for an opportunity to comment for a period of at least 30 days.

              (iii) A State program revision shall become effective when the Administrator's final approval is published in the Federal Register.
              
              (c) States with approved programs shall notify EPA whenever they propose to transfer all or part of any program from the approved State agency to any other State agency, and shall identify any new division of responsibilities among the agencies involved. The new agency is not authorized to administer the program until approved by the Administrator under paragraph (b) of this section. Organizational charts required under § 271.6(b) shall be revised and resubmitted.
              (d) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that circumstances have changed with respect to a State program, he may request, and the State shall provide, a supplemental Attorney General's statement, program description, or such other documents or information as are necessary.
              (e)(1) As the Federal program changes, authorized State programs must be revised to remain in compliance with this subpart.

              (2) Federal program changes are defined for purposes of this section as promulgated amendments to 40 CFR parts 124, 270, 260-266, or 268 and any self-implementing statutory provisions (i.e., those taking effect without prior implementing regulations) which are listed as State program requirements in this subpart. States must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and must subsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval.
              (i) For Federal program changes occurring before July 1, 1984, the State program must be modified within one year of the date of the Federal program change.
              (ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) (iii) and (iv) of this section, for Federal program changes occurring on or after July 1, 1984, the State program must be modified by July 1 of each year to reflect all changes to the Federal program occurring during the 12 months preceding the previous July 1. (For example, States must modify their programs by July 1, 1986 to reflect all changes from July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1985.)
              (iii) For Federal program changes identified in § 271.1(j) that occur between November 8, 1984 and June 30, 1987 (inclusive), the State program must be modified by July 1, 1989.
              (iv) For Federal program changes identified in § 271.1(j) that occur between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1990 (inclusive), the State program must be modified by July 1, 1991.
              (v) States may have an additional year to modify their programs for those changes to the Federal program identified in paragraphs (e) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section which necessitate a State statutory amendment.
              (3) The deadlines in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (v) may be extended by the Regional Administrator upon an adequate demonstration by a State that it has made a good faith effort to meet these deadlines and that its legislative or rulemaking procedures render the State unable to do so. No such extension shall exceed six months.

              (4)(i) Within 30 days of the completion of the State program modification the State must submit to EPA a copy of the program change and a schedule indicating when the State intends to seek approval of the change. Such schedule shall not exceed the dates provided for in paragraph (e)(4)(ii).
              (ii) Within 60 days of the appropriate deadline in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, the State must submit to EPA the documentation described in paragraph (b) of this section to revise its program.
              (f) A State must modify its program to comply with any Federal program changes which occur prior to the day that final authorization is received, except for those changes that the State has already received authorization for pursuant to § 271.3(f). Such State program modifications must be completed and submitted by the deadlines specified in paragraph (e) of this section or by the date of final authorization, whichever is later.
              (g)(1) States that are unable to modify their programs by the deadlines in paragraph (e) may be placed on a schedule of compliance to adopt the program revision(s) provided that:
              (i) The State has received an extension of the program modification deadline under paragraph (e)(3) and has made diligent efforts to revise its program during that period of time,
              (ii) The State has made progress in adopting the program modifications,
              (iii) The State submits a proposed timetable for the requisite regulatory and/or statutory revisions by the deadline granted under paragraph (e)(3),
              (iv) The schedule of compliance for program revisions does not exceed one year from the extended program modification deadline under paragraph (e)(3), and
              (v) The schedule of compliance is published in the Federal Register.
              
              (2) If a State fails to comply with the schedule of compliance, the Administrator may initiate program withdrawal procedures pursuant to §§ 271.22 and 271.23.
              (h) Abbreviated authorization revisions. This abbreviated procedure applies to State Program revisions for the Federal rulemakings listed in Table 1 of this section. The abbreviated procedures are as follows:
              (1) An application for a revision of a State's program for the rulemakings listed in Table 1 of this section shall consist of:
              (i) A statement from the State that its laws and regulations provide authority that is equivalent to, and no less stringent than, the designated minor rules or parts of rules specified in Table 1 of this section, and which includes references to the specific statutes, administrative regulations and where appropriate, judicial decisions. State statutes and regulations cited in the statement shall be lawfully adopted at the time the statement is signed and fully effective by the time the program revisions are approved; and
              (ii) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations.
              (2) Within 30 days of receipt by EPA of a State's application for final authorization to implement a rule specified in Table 1 of this section, if the Administrator determines that the application is not complete or contains errors, the Administrator shall notify the State. This notice will include a concise statement of the deficiencies which form the basis for this determination. The State will address all deficiencies and resubmit the application to EPA for review.
              (3) For purposes of this section an application is considered incomplete when:
              (i) Copies of applicable statutes or regulations were not included;
              (ii) The statutes or regulations relied on by the State to implement the program revisions are not lawfully adopted at the time the statement is signed or fully effective by the time the program revisions are approved;
              (iii) In the statement, the citations to the specific statutes, administrative regulations and where appropriate, judicial decisions are not included or incomplete; or
              (iv) The State is not authorized to implement the prerequisite RCRA rules as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.

              (4) Within 60 days after receipt of a complete final application from a State for final authorization to implement a rule or rules specified in Table 1 of this section, the Administrator shall publish a notice of the decision to grant final authorization in accordance with the procedures for immediate final publication in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (5) To be eligible to use the procedure in this paragraph (h), a State must be authorized for the provisions which the rule listed in Table 1 to this section amends.

              § 271.22
              Criteria for withdrawing approval of State programs.
              (a) The Administrator may withdraw program approval when a State program no longer complies with the requirements of this subpart, and the State fails to take corrective action. Such circumstances include the following:
              (1) When the State's legal authority no longer meets the requirements of this part, including:
              (i) Failure of the State to promulgate or enact new authorities when necessary; or
              (ii) Action by a State legislature or court striking down or limiting State authorities.
              (2) When the operation of the State program fails to comply with the requirements of this part, including:
              (i) Failure to exercise control over activities required to be regulated under this part, including failure to issue permits;
              (ii) Repeated issuance of permits which do not conform to the requirements of this part; or
              (iii) Failure to comply with the public participation requirements of this part.
              (3) When the State's enforcement program fails to comply with the requirements of this part, including:
              (i) Failure to act on violations of permits or other program requirements;
              (ii) Failure to seek adequate enforcement penalties or to collect administrative fines when imposed; or
              (iii) Failure to inspect and monitor activities subject to regulation.
              (4) When the State program fails to comply with the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement required under § 271.8.
            
            
              § 271.23
              Procedures for withdrawing approval of State programs.
              (a) A State with a program approved under this part may voluntarily transfer program responsibilities required by Federal law to EPA by taking the following actions, or in such other manner as may be agreed upon with the Administrator.

              (1) The State shall give the Administrator 180 days notice of the proposed transfer and shall submit a plan for the orderly transfer of all relevant program information not in the possession of EPA (such as permits, permit files, compliance files, reports, permit applications) which are necessary for EPA to administer the program.
              
              (2) Within 60 days of receiving the notice and transfer plan, the Administrator shall evaluate the State's transfer plan and shall identify any additional information needed by the Federal government for program administration and/or identify any other deficiencies in the plan.

              (3) At least 30 days before the transfer is to occur the Administrator shall publish notice of the transfer in the Federal Register and in enough of the largest newspapers in the State to provide Statewide coverage, and shall mail notice to all permit holders, permit applicants, other regulated persons and other interested persons on appropriate EPA and State mailing lists.
              (b) The following procedures apply when the Administrator orders the commencement of proceedings to determine whether to withdraw approval of a State program.
              (1) Order. The Administrator may order the commencement of withdrawal proceedings on his or her own initiative or in response to a petition from an interested person alleging failure of the State to comply with the requirements of this part as set forth in § 271.22. The Administrator shall respond in writing to any petition to commence withdrawal proceedings. He may conduct an informal investigation of the allegations in the petition to determine whether cause exists to commence proceedings under this paragraph. The Administrator's order commencing proceedings under this paragraph shall fix a time and place for the commencement of the hearing and shall specify the allegations against the State which are to be considered at the hearing. Within 30 days the State shall admit or deny these allegations in a written answer. The party seeking withdrawal of the State's program shall have the burden of coming forward with the evidence in a hearing under this paragraph.
              (2) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph the definitions of Act, Administrative Law Judge, Hearing, Hearing Clerk, and Presiding Officer in 40 CFR 22.03 apply in addition to the following:

              § 271.26
              Requirements for used oil management.
              The State shall have standards for used oil management which are equivalent to 40 CFR part 279. These standards shall include:
              (a) Standards for used oil generators which are equivalent to those under subpart C of part 279 of this chapter;
              (b) Standards for used oil collection centers and aggregation points which are equivalent to those under subpart D of part 279 of this chapter;
              (c) Standards for used oil transporters and transfer facilities which are equivalent to those under subpart E of part 279 of this chapter;
              (d) Standards for used oil processors and re-refiners which are equivalent to those under subpart F of part 279 of this chapter;
              (e) Standards for used oil burners who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery which are equivalent to those under subpart G of part 279 of this chapter;
              (f) Standards for used oil fuel marketers which are equivalent to those under subpart H of part 279 of this chapter; and
              (g) Standards for use as a dust suppressant and disposal of used oil which are equivalent to those under subpart I of part 279 of this chapter. A State may petition (e.g., as part of its authorization petition submitted to EPA under § 271.5) EPA to allow the use of used oil (that is not mixed with hazardous waste and does not exhibit a characteristic other than ignitability) as a dust suppressant. The State must show that it has a program in place to prevent the use of used oil/hazardous waste mixtures or used oil exhibiting a characteristic other than ignitability as a dust suppressant. In addition, such programs must minimize the impacts of use as a dust suppressant on the environment.

              (h)(1) Unless otherwise provided in part 271, state programs shall have standards for the marketing and burning of used oil for energy recovery that are at least as stringent as the requirements and prohibitions that EPA adopted on November 29, in 40 CFR part 266, subpart E of this chapter. The part 279 of this chapter requirements specified in Table 1 (except those provisions identified in footnotes 1 and 2 of Table 1) are Federally enforceable in those states that have not adopted state requirements equivalent to 40 CFR part 279, subparts G and H of this chapter requirements and have not been authorized to enforce the state requirements.

              (5) Vacated Federal rule. Arkansas adopted and was authorized for the following Federal rule which has since been vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. 08-1144; June 27, 2014). As a result, the Arkansas provisions at Reg. 23, 260.10 “Gasification” and 261.4(a)(12)(i) are no longer considered to be part of the State's authorized program. Consistent with the Court's vacatur, EPA removed the vacated provisions from the CFR on April 8, 2015.

              § 272.400
              State authorization.

              (a) The State of Delaware is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq., subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR 271.9 through 271.17 and 271.21. The State's program, as administered by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval was effective on June 22, 1984, 48 FR 23837.

              (b) Delaware is not authorized to implement any HSWA requirement in lieu of EPA unless EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to do so in a Federal Register notice granting Delaware authorization.
              (c) Delaware has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities, including conducting inspections under section 3007, 42 U.S.C. 6927, and taking enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003, 42 U.S.C. 6928, 6934 and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.
              (d) Delaware must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Delaware must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Delaware obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.401. If Delaware obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.402.

              (ii) Some regulations listed in the table in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section are predominantly HSWA authority but contain provisions that are not HSWA authority. EPA will not enforce these non-HSWA provisions. The affected rules are as follows:
              (A) Burning of Hazardous Waste in Boilers and Industrial Furnaces (BIF), including BIF (February 21, 1991);
              (B) Corrections and Technical Amendments I (July 17, 1991);

              (iii) EPA will not enforce BIF rules for Sludge Dryers, Infrared Incinerators, Plasma Arc Incinerators, and Carbon Regeneration Units, until Indiana is authorized for these rules. Petroleum Refining Process (August 6, 1998, as amended October 9, 1998) 40 CFR 261.3, 261.4, and 261.6 are non-HSWA provisions. Standards Applicable to Owners and Operators of Closed/Closing Facilities (October 22, 1998) 40 CFR 264.90(e), 265.110(c), 265.118(c)(4), 265.121 (except § 265.121(a)(2)), 270.1, 270.14(a), and 270.28 are non-HSWA provisions. Hazardous Remediation Waste Management Requirements (HWIR Media) (November 30, 1998) 40 CFR 261.4(g), 264.1(j)(1-13), 264.73(b)(17), 270.2, 270.11(d), 270.68, 270.73(a), and 270.79 through 270.230 (40 CFR part 270, subpart H) except § 270.230(e)(1) are non-HSWA provisions. Until Indiana becomes authorized for these rules, EPA will not enforce the non-HSWA provisions.
              (5) Memorandum of Agreement. The Memorandum of Agreement between EPA Region 5 and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, signed by the Commissioner of the IDEM on February 14, 1996 and acknowledged by the EPA Regional Administrator in the Federal Register noticed signed on July 29, 1996, August 2, 1999, and December 14, 2000, is referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.
              
              (6) Statement of legal authority. “Attorney General's Statement for Final Authorization”, signed by the Attorney General of Indiana on June 28, 1985 and revisions, supplements and addenda to that Statement dated August 26, 1986, June 1, 1987, December 15, 1987, March 25, 1988, July 22, 1988, December 15, 1989, May 29, 1996, March 24, 1997, and January 31, 2000 are referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.

              (ii)(A) The following authorized provisions of the Louisiana regulations include amendments published in the Louisiana Register that are not approved by EPA. Such unauthorized amendments are not part of the State's authorized program and are, therefore, not Federally enforceable. Thus, notwithstanding the language in the Louisiana hazardous waste regulations incorporated by reference at paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will enforce the State provisions that are actually authorized by EPA. The effective dates of the State's authorized provisions are listed in the following Table.

              State authorization.

              (a) The State of Michigan is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq. subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR part 271. The State's program, as administered by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval of Michigan's base program was effective on October 30, 1986 (see 51 FR 36804). EPA's approval of the revisions to Michigan's base program was effective on January 23, 1990 (see 54 FR 48608) and RCRA Cluster III authorization effective June 24, 1991 (see 56 FR 18517).

              (b) Michigan is authorized to implement certain HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA. EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow such action in a Federal Register notice granting Michigan authorization and RCRA Cluster III authorization effective June 24, 1991 (see 56 FR 18517).
              (c) Michigan has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.
              (d) Michigan must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Michigan must seek final authorization for all program revisions, pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA, pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Michigan obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1151 of this subpart. If Michigan obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1152.

              State authorization.

              (a) The State of Missouri is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq., subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), (Pub. L. 98-616, Nov. 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g)). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR part 271. The State's program, as administered by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this Chapter. EPA's approval was effective on December 4, 1985 (50 FR 47740, November 20, 1985).

              (b) Missouri is not authorized to implement any HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA unless EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow such action in a Federal Register notice granting Missouri authorization.
              (c) Missouri has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.

              (d) Missouri must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Missouri must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Missouri obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1301 of this subpart. If Missouri obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provision will be listed in § 227.1302.

The Agency needs further analysis to determine if the breaking and crushing of universal waste lamps will be authorized as part of the State's authorized program. Therefore, in this codification notice EPA has determined to exclude the lamp crushing provisions from this codification.

              § 272.1651
              New York State-administered program: Final authorization.
              (a) New York State authorization. Pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), New York has final authorization for the following elements as submitted to EPA in New York's base program application for final authorization which was approved by EPA effective on May 29, 1986. Subsequent program revision applications were approved effective on July 3, 1989, May 7, 1990, October 29, 1991, May 22, 1992, August 28, 1995, October 14, 1997, January 15, 2002, March 14, 2005, August 31, 2009, January 12, 2010, and May 10, 2013.
              (b) Authorization enforcement. The State of New York has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste management program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities in accordance with sections 3007, 3008, 3013, 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, 6973, and any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, regardless of whether the State has taken its own actions, as well as in accordance with other statutory and regulatory provisions.
              (c) State statutes and regulations—(1) Statutes and regulations that are incorporated by reference.

              (ii) [Reserved]
              
              (2) Statutes and regulations that are not incorporated. EPA considered the following statutes and regulations in evaluating the State program but is not incorporating them herein for enforcement purposes:
              (i) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2004 Cumulative Pocket Part: Sections 1-0303(18), 3-0301(1) (introductory paragraph); 3-0301(1)(a), (b), (m), (o), (w), (x) and (cc); 3-0301(2) introductory paragraph; 3-0301(2)(a), (b), (d) through (j), (l), (m), (q) and (z); 3-0301(4); 19-0301(1) (except 19-0301(c), (e) and (f)); 19-0303(1) through (3); 19-0304; 23-2305; 23-2307; 27-0105; 27-0701; 27-0703; 27-0705; 27-0707 (except 27-0707(2-c)); 27-0711; 27-0900 through 27-0908; 27-0909 (except 27-0909(5)); 27-0910 through 27-0922; 27-1105; 70-0101; 70-0103; 70-0105 (except 70-0105(3) and 70-0105(6)); 70-0107(1) and (2); 70-0107(3) introductory paragraph; 70-0107(3)(l); 70-0109; 70-0113; 70-0115 (except (2)(c) and (d)); 70-0117 (except 70-0117(5) through (7); 70-0119; 70-0121; 71-0301; 71-1719; 71-2705; 71-2707; 71-2709 through 71-2715; 71-2717; 71-2720; and 71-2727.
              (ii) McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 1, Executive Law (EL), Article 6: Section 102.
              (iii) McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 46, Public Officers Law (POL), as amended through 2004: Sections 87 and 89.
              (iv) McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 7B, Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), as amended through 2004: Sections 1013, 6301; 6311; and 6313.
              (v) Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA) State Technology Law (STL), Article 3, as amended effective August 17, 2009: Sections 305 and 306.
              (vi) Title 6, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (6 NYCRR), Volume A-2A, as amended effective through September 5, 2006: Sections 372.1(f); 373-1.1(f) and (g); 373-1.4(b); 373-1.4(d) through (f); 373-1.6(c); 621.1 through 621.4; 621.5 (except (d)(5), (d)(6)(i), (d)(7)(i)(a), (d)(7)(i)(c) and (d)(9)); 621.6 (except (b), (d)(4) and (d)(5)); 621.7; 621.8; 621.9 (except (a)(5), (c)(2) and (e)(2)); 621.10; 621.11 (except (d)); 621.12 through 621.15; and 621.16 (except (b), (d) and (e)).
              (vii) Title 9, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (9 NYCRR), Part 540, Electronics Signature and Records Act, as amended effective May 7, 2003: Sections 540.1 through 540.6.
              (3) Statutes and regulations that are broader in scope. The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader in scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, are not incorporated by reference and are not federally enforceable:
              (i) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2004 Cumulative Pocket Part: Sections 27-0301; 27-0303; 27-0305; 27-0307; 27-0909(5); 27-0923; 27-0925 and 27-0926.
              (ii) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2006 Cumulative Pocket Part: Section 27-1109(6).
              (iii) The following New York provisions are broader in scope because the State implements a Household Hazardous Waste program, whereas the Federal program excludes household waste from regulation as hazardous waste at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1): Title 6, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (6 NYCRR), as amended effective through September 5, 2006: Sections 370.2(b)(92) “Household hazardous waste”; 370.2(b)(93) “Household hazardous waste collection facility”; and 373-4.
              (iv) At 371.4(c), New York retains K064, K065, K066, K090 and K091 as hazardous wastes while EPA has removed them from the table at 40 CFR 261.32 and no longer regulates them as hazardous wastes (64 FR 56469; October 20, 1999).

              (v) In the following provisions of New York's hazardous waste regulations, the State cross-references Part 364 “Waste Transporter Permits” requirements, which sets forth transporter requirements regarding permit and financial liability requirements: 372.2(b)(5)(ii), 372.3(a)(1), 372.3(a)(4), 372.3(b)(6)(iv), 372.3(d)(3), 373-2.5(b)(3)(ii)(d) and (e), 373-1.7(h)(3), 373-3.5(b)(3)(ii)(d) and (e), 374-3.4(a)(2), and Appendix 30 Instructions for Generators/Item 8. These provisions referencing the Part 364 transporter permit and financial liability requirements are broader in scope than the Federal program.
              (vi) New York did not adopt an analog to 40 CFR 261.4(g) that excludes certain dredged materials from the State definition of hazardous waste. Instead, the State subjects these materials to full regulation as hazardous wastes.
              (vii) New York State regulations do not incorporate the Mineral Processing Secondary Materials Exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(17) and the related changes affecting 40 CFR 261.2(c)(3) and (c)(4)/Table, and 40 CFR 261.2(e)(1)(iii). Since New York did not adopt the exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(17) the State has a broader in scope program because the effect is to include materials that are not considered solid waste by EPA.
              (viii) The following New York provisions are broader in scope because they include requirements associated with the regulation of PCB waste as a state-only hazardous waste: 371.4(e), 372.1(e)(9), 373-1.1(d)(1)(x), 374-2.2(a)(9), 374-2.2(b) Table 1 and Footnote 2, 374-2.5(e)(4), 374-2.6(d)(4), 374-2.7(d)(4), 376.1(g)(1)(i), and 376.4(f). PCB wastes are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) at 40 CFR part 761 rather than under the Federal RCRA program.
              (ix) The New York provision at 373-1.4(c) is broader in scope because it includes siting certificate requirements which are not part of the Federal program.
              (x) The New York provision at 373-2.15(a)(2) is broader in scope because it subjects incinerators to not just limited portions of the State's Air regulations in the same manner as the Federal rules, but entire programs including air program-specific permits and registrations.
              (xi) The New York provisions at 374-2.5(a)(2) and 374-2.6(a)(2) cross-reference 360-14.1(a)(4), which sets forth transfer facility and processor/re-refiner requirements for these types of facilities co-located at hazardous waste management facilities. These provisions referencing the Part 360 requirements are broader in scope than the Federal program because section 360-14.1(a)(4) may require used oil transfer facilities and processors/re-refiners managing non-hazardous used oil to be subject to State-only Part 360 provisions including permit requirements. The Federal program does not have an analogous permitting requirement for these types of facilities.
              (4) Vacated Federal rule. New York provisions at 371.1(e)(1)(xvi) and 371.4(i) are no longer considered to be part of New York's authorized program because the equivalent federal requirements were vacated by a federal court. The Federal Requirements ((Hazardous Waste Combustors; Revised Standards (HSWA) (40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 only) were published on June 19, 1998. The New York regulations were authorized on January 11, 2005 (effective March 14, 2005). The State's authorized program was subsequently codified in 40 CFR part 272 on March 26, 2007 (effective May 25, 2007). However, the corresponding Federal rules were later vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 98-1379; June 27, 2014). Consistent with the Court's vacatur, EPA issued a new final rule removing 40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 from the Federal CFR (published on April 8, 2015)
              (5) Memorandum of Agreement. The Memorandum of Agreement between EPA Region 2 and the State of New York, signed by the Commissioner of the State of New York Department of Environmental Conservation on July 20, 2001, and by the EPA Regional Administrator on January 16, 2002, although not incorporated by reference, is referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.
              
              (6) Statement of Legal Authority. “Attorney General's Statement for Final Authorization”, signed by the Attorney General of New York in 1985 and revisions, supplements, and addenda to that Statement dated August 18, 1988, July 26, 1989, August 15, 1991, October 11, 1991, July 28, 1994, May 30, 1997, February 5, 2001, April 2, 2004, June 13, 2008 (including three certifications), August 17, 2009, and May 22, 2012, although not incorporated by reference, are referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.

              North Dakota State-administered program: Final authorization.
              (a) History of the State of North Dakota authorization. Pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), North Dakota has final authorization for the following elements as submitted to the EPA in North Dakota's base program application for final authorization which was approved by the EPA effective on October 19, 1984. Subsequent program revision applications were approved effective on August 24, 1990, July 6, 1992, June 6, 1994, March 20, 2000, November 25, 2005, April 14, 2008, and October 30, 2018.
              (b) Enforcement authority. The State of North Dakota has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste management program. However, the EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities in accordance with sections 3007, 3008, 3013, 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, 6973, and any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, regardless of whether the state has taken its own actions, as well as in accordance with other statutory and regulatory provisions.
              (c) State Statutes and Regulations—(1) Incorporation by reference. The North Dakota statutes and regulations cited in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are incorporated by reference as part of the hazardous waste management program under Subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.

Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 862 F.3d 50 (D.C. Cir. 2017) and Am. Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, No. 09-1038 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 6, 2018) (vacating both the Factor 4 Legitimacy Test and the Verified Recycler Exclusion aspects of the 2015 DSW Rule): One criterion in the determination of whether recycling is legitimate at 40 CFR 260.43(a)(4); the verified recycler exclusion, which allowed generators to send their hazardous secondary materials to certain reclaimers at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(24); and the associated provisions at 40 CFR 260.30(d) and 260.31(d), which address the criteria in the variance determination for exceptions to the classification of hazardous secondary materials as a solid waste. As a result, those state provisions will be considered broader in scope than the federal program, as it pertains to the specific vacated provisions, and are listed in § 272.1751(c)(3)(iii) with the rest of North Dakota's broader in scope regulatory provisions).

              § 272.1800
              State authorization.

              (a) The State of Ohio is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq., subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR part 271. The State's program, as administered by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval of Ohio's base RCRA program was effective on June 30, 1989 (see 54 FR 27173). EPA's approval of revisions to Ohio's base program was effective on June 7, 1991 (see 56 FR 14203) and August 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 28088).

              (b) Ohio is authorized to implement certain HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA. EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow much action in a Federal Register notice granting Ohio authorization on June 7, 1991 (see 56 FR 14203) and August 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 28088).
              (c) Ohio has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities under Section 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.
              (d) Ohio must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program, in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Ohio must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Ohio obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(b), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in 272.1801 of this subpart. If Ohio in the future obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1802.

              (4) Unauthorized State amendments and provisions. (i) The following authorized provisions of the Texas regulations include amendments published in the Texas Register that are not approved by EPA. Such unauthorized amendments are not part of the State's authorized program and are, therefore, not Federally enforceable. Thus, notwithstanding the language in the Texas hazardous waste regulations incorporated by reference at paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will enforce the State provisions that are actually authorized by EPA. The effective dates of the State's authorized provisions are listed in the table in this paragraph (c)(4)(i). The actual State regulatory text authorized by EPA (i.e., without the unauthorized amendments) is available as a separate document, Addendum to the EPA-Approved Texas Regulatory and Statutory Requirements Applicable to the Hazardous Waste Management Program, November, 2014. Copies of the document can be obtained from U.S. EPA Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, TX 75202.

              (ii) Texas has partially or fully adopted, but is not authorized to implement, the Federal rules that are listed in the table in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). The EPA will continue to implement the Federal HSWA requirements for which Texas is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization for those requirements. The EPA will not enforce the non-HSWA Federal rules although they may be enforceable under State law. For those Federal rules that contain both HSWA and non-HSWA requirements, the EPA will enforce only the HSWA portions of the rules.

              § 272.2251
              Utah State-administered program: Final authorization.
              (a) Pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), Utah has Final authorization for the following elements as submitted to EPA in Utah's base program application for Final authorization which was approved by EPA effective on October 24, 1984. Subsequent program revision applications were approved effective on March 7, 1989; July 22, 1991; July 14, 1992; April 13, 1993; December 13, 1994; July 21, 1997; and March 15, 1999.
              (b) State statutes and regulations. (1) The Utah regulations cited in this paragraph are incorporated by reference as part of the hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies of the Utah regulations that are incorporated by reference in this paragraph are available from the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, 288 North 1460 West, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114-4880, Phone (801) 538-6776.
              (i) The EPA Approved Utah Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Hazardous Waste Management Program, dated March 1999.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (2) The following statutes and regulations concerning State procedures and enforcement, although not incorporated by reference, are part of the authorized State program:

              (i) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3A, 1998 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 19: Sections 19-1-306(2), 19-1-306(3), 19-6-102 introductory paragraph, 19-6-102(1) & (2), 19-6-102(6)-(9), 19-6-102(11), 19-6-102(13)-(21), 19-6-102.1, 19-6-103, 19-6-104(1) except (1)(j), 19-6-105(1) introductory paragraph, 19-6-105(1)(a)-(f), 19-6-105(1)(i) & (j), 19-6-105(2), 19-6-106, 19-6-107, 19-6-109, 19-6-111, 19-6-112, 19-6-113(1) through (4), 19-6-113(6), 19-6-114, 19-6-115, and 19-6-116.
              (ii) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 6D, 1997 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 63: Sections 63-2-103 through 63-2-105, 63-2-201 through 63-2-203 (except 63-2-203(10)), 63-2-204, 63-2-205, 63-2-301 through 63-2-308, 63-2-401 through 63-2-405, and 63-2-802.
              (iii) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3, 1953 as amended 1987, Title 26, Chapter 14: Section 26-14-8.
              (iv) Utah Administrative Code revised as of January 3, 1989: R450-3.1.1(b) & (c) and R450-3-2.4(b).
              (v) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996: Sections R315-2-14, R315-3-3(i)(1)&(3), R315-3-11(a), (b) & (f), R315-3-16(b), R315-3-23(b)(1) & (2), R315-3-23(c) & (d), R315-3-24(a) through R315-3-29, and R315-3-34.
              (vi) Utah Administrative Code revised as of May 15, 1996: Section R315-15-1.1(j) & (k).
              (3) The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader-in-scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, and are not incorporated by reference:
              (i) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3A, 1998 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 19: Sections 19-6-105(3), 19-6-113(5), 19-6-118, 19-6-120, and 19-6-121.
              (ii) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996. EPA considers Utah's listing of all P999 and some F999 wastes (specifically: nerve, military, and chemical agents) as more stringent than the Federal rule. To the extent that unused chemical agents, as produced, exhibit a hazardous waste reactivity characteristic, they are considered hazardous waste and, thus, are regulated under Federal rule. Utah's listing of these wastes enhances the degree of regulatory control regarding these wastes. EPA also considers Utah's rule as broader-in-scope than the federal rule for those F999 process wastes which do not exhibit a characteristic for hazardous waste and would not be regulated under Federal rule. R315-2-10(e)(1), 315-2-11(e) introductory paragraph and R315-2-11(e)(1) are broader-in-scope regarding these wastes.
              (iii) Utah Administrative Code, as of May 15, 1996: R315-15-7.1(d), R315-15-10, R315-15-11 with respect to used oil transfer and off-specification used oil burning facilities, and R315-15-12 through R315-15-15 except R315-15-13.5(d).
              (4) Unauthorized State provisions: (i) Although the Federal rules listed in the following table have been adopted by the State and have been included in the materials incorporated by reference in paragraph (b)(1) of this Section, EPA has not authorized the State for these rules at this time. While they may be enforceable under State law, they are not enforceable under RCRA:

EPA will continue to implement the Federal HSWA requirements for which Utah is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization for those requirements.

              § 273.3
              Applicability—pesticides.
              (a) Pesticides covered under this part 273. The requirements of this part apply to persons managing pesticides, as described in § 273.9, meeting the following conditions, except those listed in paragraph (b) of this section:
              (1) Recalled pesticides that are:
              (i) Stocks of a suspended and canceled pesticide that are part of a voluntary or mandatory recall under FIFRA Section 19(b), including, but not limited to those owned by the registrant responsible for conducting the recall; or
              (ii) Stocks of a suspended or cancelled pesticide, or a pesticide that is not in compliance with FIFRA, that are part of a voluntary recall by the registrant.
              (2) Stocks of other unused pesticide products that are collected and managed as part of a waste pesticide collection program.
              (b) Pesticides not covered under 40 CFR part 273. The requirements of this part do not apply to persons managing the following pesticides:
              (1) Recalled pesticides described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and unused pesticide products described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that are managed by farmers in compliance with 40 CFR 262.70. (40 CFR 262.70 addresses pesticides disposed of on the farmer's own farm in a manner consistent with the disposal instructions on the pesticide label, providing the container is triple rinsed in accordance with 40 CFR 261.7(b)(3));
              (2) Pesticides not meeting the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. These pesticides must be managed in compliance with the hazardous waste regulations in 40 CFR parts 260 through 272;
              (3) Pesticides that are not wastes under part 261 of this chapter, including those that do not meet the criteria for waste generation in paragraph (c) of this section or those that are not wastes as described in paragraph (d) of this section; and
              (4) Pesticides that are not hazardous waste. A pesticide is a hazardous waste if it is listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D or if it exhibits one or more of the characteristics identified in 40 CFR part 261, subpart C.
              (c) When a pesticide becomes a waste. (1) A recalled pesticide described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section becomes a waste on the first date on which both of the following conditions apply:
              (i) The generator of the recalled pesticide agrees to participate in the recall; and
              (ii) The person conducting the recall decides to discard (e.g., burn the pesticide for energy recovery).
              (2) An unused pesticide product described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section becomes a waste on the date the generator decides to discard it.
              (d) Pesticides that are not wastes. The following pesticides are not wastes:

              (1) Recalled pesticides described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the person conducting the recall:
              
              (i) Has not made a decision to discard (e.g., burn for energy recovery) the pesticide. Until such a decision is made, the pesticide does not meet the definition of “solid waste” under 40 CFR 261.2; thus the pesticide is not a hazardous waste and is not subject to hazardous waste requirements, including this part 273. This pesticide remains subject to the requirements of FIFRA; or

              (ii) Has made a decision to use a management option that, under 40 CFR 261.2, does not cause the pesticide to be a solid waste (i.e., the selected option is use (other than use constituting disposal) or reuse (other than burning for energy recovery), or reclamation). Such a pesticide is not a solid waste and therefore is not a hazardous waste, and is not subject to the hazardous waste requirements including this part 273. This pesticide, including a recalled pesticide that is exported to a foreign destination for use or reuse, remains subject to the requirements of FIFRA.
              (2) Unused pesticide products described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the generator of the unused pesticide product has not decided to discard (e.g., burn for energy recovery) them. These pesticides remain subject to the requirements of FIFRA.

              § 273.4
              Applicability—Mercury-containing equipment.
              (a) Mercury-containing equipment covered under this part 273. The requirements of this part apply to persons managing mercury-containing equipment, as described in § 273.9, except those listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Mercury-containing equipment not covered under this part 273. The requirements of this part do not apply to persons managing the following mercury-containing equipment:
              (1) Mercury-containing equipment that is not yet a waste under part 261 of this chapter. Paragraph (c) of this section describes when mercury-containing equipment becomes a waste;

              (a) A universal waste transporter must comply with all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR part 171 through 180 for transport of any universal waste that meets the definition of hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8. For purposes of the Department of Transportation regulations, a material is considered a hazardous waste if it is subject to the Hazardous Waste Manifest Requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency specified in 40 CFR part 262. Because universal waste does not require a hazardous waste manifest, it is not considered hazardous waste under the Department of Transportation regulations.
              (b) Some universal waste materials are regulated by the Department of Transportation as hazardous materials because they meet the criteria for one or more hazard classes specified in 49 CFR 173.2. As universal waste shipments do not require a manifest under 40 CFR 262, they may not be described by the DOT proper shipping name “hazardous waste, (l) or (s), n.o.s.”, nor may the hazardous material's proper shipping name be modified by adding the word “waste”.
            
            
              § 273.53
              Storage time limits.
              (a) A universal waste transporter may only store the universal waste at a universal waste transfer facility for ten days or less.
              (b) If a universal waste transporter stores universal waste for more than ten days, the transporter becomes a universal waste handler and must comply with the applicable requirements of subparts B or C of this part while storing the universal waste.
            
            
              § 273.54
              Response to releases.
              (a) A universal waste transporter must immediately contain all releases of universal wastes and other residues from universal wastes.
              (b) A universal waste transporter must determine whether any material resulting from the release is hazardous waste, and if so, it is subject to all applicable requirements of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. If the waste is determined to be a hazardous waste, the transporter is subject to 40 CFR part 262.
            
            
              
              § 273.55
              Off-site shipments.
              (a) A universal waste transporter is prohibited from transporting the universal waste to a place other than a universal waste handler, a destination facility, or a foreign destination.
              (b) If the universal waste being shipped off-site meets the Department of Transportation's definition of hazardous materials under 49 CFR 171.8, the shipment must be properly described on a shipping paper in accordance with the applicable Department of Transportation regulations under 49 CFR part 172.
            
            
              § 273.56
              Exports.
              A universal waste transporter transporting a shipment of universal waste to a foreign destination is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 262, subpart H.

              § 273.61
              Off-site shipments.
              (a) The owner or operator of a destination facility is prohibited from sending or taking universal waste to a place other than a universal waste handler, another destination facility or foreign destination.
              (b) The owner or operator of a destination facility may reject a shipment containing universal waste, or a portion of a shipment containing universal waste. If the owner or operator of the destination facility rejects a shipment or a portion of a shipment, he must contact the shipper to notify him of the rejection and to discuss reshipment of the load. The owner or operator of the destination facility must:
              (1) Send the shipment back to the original shipper, or
              (2) If agreed to by both the shipper and the owner or operator of the destination facility, send the shipment to another destination facility.
              (c) If the owner or operator of a destination facility receives a shipment containing hazardous waste that is not a universal waste, the owner or operator of the destination facility must immediately notify the appropriate regional EPA office of the illegal shipment, and provide the name, address, and phone number of the shipper. The EPA regional office will provide instructions for managing the hazardous waste.
              (d) If the owner or operator of a destination facility receives a shipment of non-hazardous, non-universal waste, the owner or operator may manage the waste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal or state solid waste regulations.
            
            
              § 273.62
              Tracking universal waste shipments.
              (a) The owner or operator of a destination facility must keep a record of each shipment of universal waste received at the facility. The record may take the form of a log, invoice, manifest, bill of lading, movement document or other shipping document. The record for each shipment of universal waste received must include the following information:
              (1) The name and address of the universal waste handler, destination facility, or foreign shipper from whom the universal waste was sent;
              (2) The quantity of each type of universal waste received (e.g., batteries, pesticides, thermostats);
              (3) The date of receipt of the shipment of universal waste.
              (b) The owner or operator of a destination facility must retain the records described in paragraph (a) of this section for at least three years from the date of receipt of a shipment of universal waste.

                Effective Date Note:
                At 84 FR 5950, Feb. 22, 2019, § 273.80 was amended by revising paragraph (a) and adding paragraph (d), effective Aug. 21, 2019. For the convenience of the user, the added and revised text is set forth as follows:
                
                  
                    § 273.80
                    General.
                    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any person seeking to add a hazardous waste or category of hazardous waste to this part may petition for a regulatory amendment under this subpart and 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.23.
                    
                    (d) Hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are regulated by 40 CFR part 266 subpart P and may not be added as a category of hazardous waste for management under this part.
                  
                
              
            
            
              § 273.81
              Factors for petitions to include other wastes under 40 CFR part 273.

              (a) The waste or category of waste, as generated by a wide variety of generators, is listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter, or (if not listed) a proportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter. (When a characteristic waste is added to the universal waste regulations of this part 273 by using a generic name to identify the waste category (e.g., batteries), the definition of universal waste in § 260.10 of this chapter and § 273.9 will be amended to include only the hazardous waste portion of the waste category (e.g., hazardous waste batteries).) Thus, only the portion of the waste stream that does exhibit one or more characteristics (i.e., is hazardous waste) is subject to the universal waste regulations of this part 273;

              (b) The waste or category of waste is not exclusive to a specific industry or group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of establishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial businesses, office complexes, very small quantity generators, small businesses, government organizations, as well as large industrial facilities);
              (c) The waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of generators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in relatively small quantities by each generator;
              (d) Systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste (including packaging, marking, and labeling practices) would ensure close stewardship of the waste;
              (e) The risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific management standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste management requirements appropriate to be added to 40 CFR 273.13, 273.33, and 273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be protective of human health and the environment during accumulation and transport;
              (f) Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 will increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted from non-hazardous waste management systems (e.g., the municipal waste stream, non-hazardous industrial or commercial waste stream, municipal sewer or stormwater systems) to recycling, treatment, or disposal in compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA.
              (g) Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 will improve implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste regulatory program; and/or
              (h) Such other factors as may be appropriate.

            § 278.1
            Definitions.
            (a) Asphalt concrete—a layer, or combination of layers, composed of a compacted mixture of an asphalt binder and mineral aggregate.
            (b) Chat—waste material that was formed in the course of milling operations employed to recover lead and zinc from metal-bearing ore minerals in the Tri-State Mining District of Southwest Missouri, Southeast Kansas and Northeast Oklahoma.
            (c) Chip seal—a material composed of aggregate placed on top of a layer of an asphalt or asphaltic liquid binder. The aggregate may be rolled into the binder.
            (d) Cold mix asphalt—refers to an asphalt and aggregate mixture composed of binders, soaps, or other chemicals which allow its use when cold
            (e) Epoxy seal—refers to the mixture of aggregate in epoxy binders. Epoxy seals are typically used as an anti-skid surface on bridge decking
            (f) Federal or State response action—State or Federal response action undertaken pursuant to applicable Federal or State environmental laws and with consideration of site-specific risk assessments.
            (g) Flowable fill—a cementitious slurry consisting of a mixture of fine aggregate or filler, water, and cementitious materials which is used primarily as a backfill in lieu of compacted earth.
            
            (h) Granular road base—road base typically constructed by spreading aggregates in thin layers of 150 mm (6 inches) to 200 mm (8 inches) and compacting each layer by rolling over it with heavy compaction equipment. The aggregate base layers serve a variety of purposes, including reducing the stress applied to the sub grade layer and providing drainage for the pavement structure. The granular sub base forms the lowest (bottom) layer of the pavement structure and acts as the principal foundation for the subsequent road profile.
            (i) Hot Mix Asphalt—a hot mixture of asphalt binder and size-graded aggregate, which can be compacted into a uniform dense mass. Hot mix asphalt also includes hot mix asphalt sub bases and hot mix asphalt bases.
            (j) Microsurfacing—polymer-modified slurry seal.
            (k) Portland cement concrete (PCC)—pavements consisting of a PCC slab that is usually supported by a granular (made of compacted aggregate) base or sub base.
            (l) Pozzolanic—a siliceous material which when combined with calcium hydroxide in the presence of moisture exhibits cementitious properties.
            (m) Slurry seal—refers to a material composed of emulsified asphalt, aggregate, and mineral fillers, such as Portland cement or lime which is applied as a thin coating on top of asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete road surfaces.
            (n) Stabilized base—a non-asphaltic road base composed of aggregate mixed with a pozzolanic material which increases the bearing strength of the material.
            (o) Transportation construction projects—these activities relate to the construction of roads and highways and include bases, sub bases, road surfaces, bridges, abutments, shoulders, and embankments. They are not related to any residential use.
            (p) Tri-State Mining District—the lead-zinc mining areas of Ottawa County, Oklahoma, Cherokee County of southeast Kansas and Jasper, Newton, Lawrence, and Barry Counties of southwest Missouri.
            (q) Warm mix asphalt—refers to a mixture of an asphalt binder with aggregate, paraffin or esterfied wax, and mineral additives that allow its use at temperatures much lower than hot mix asphalt.
          
          
            § 278.2
            Applicability.
            These requirements apply to chat from the Tri-State Mining District used in transportation construction projects carried out, in whole or in part, using Federal funds.
          
          
            § 278.3
            Criteria for use of chat in Federally funded transportation projects.
            Chat can be used in transportation construction projects carried out, in whole or in part, using Federal funds if:
            (a) The chat is used in hot, warm or cold mix asphalt, in slurry seal, microsurfacing, or in epoxy seal; or
            (b) The chat is used in Portland cement concrete, granular road base, flowable fill, stabilized road base or chip seal if, on a case by case basis either:
            (1) Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) tests are conducted on the proposed material using EPA SW-846 Method 1312, incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter, and the leachate testing results show that concentrations in the leachate do not exceed the National Primary Drinking Water Standards for lead and cadmium and the fresh water chronic National Recommended Water Quality Criterion for zinc of 120 µg/l; or
            (2) EPA (or a State environmental Agency, if it chooses to do so) has determined, based on a site-specific risk assessment and after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the releases from the chat mixture in its proposed use will not cause an exceedance of the National Primary Drinking Water Standards for lead and cadmium in potential drinking water sources and the fresh water chronic National Recommended Water Quality Criterion for zinc of 120 µg/l in surface water; or
            (c) The use of chat has been authorized pursuant to a State or Federal response action.
          
          
            § 278.4
            Certification and recordkeeping requirements.
            (a) Certification. For chat used under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, the EPA certification below is not applicable. In other jurisdictions, the acquirer shall:
            (1) Submit a signed, written certification to the environmental regulatory agency in the State where the chat is to be used within 30 days of the date of acquisition. The certification shall contain the following:
            (i) Location of origin of the chat;
            (ii) Amount of chat acquired; and
            (iii) Certification Statement: I certify under penalty of law that the chat used in this transportation project will meet EPA criteria found in § 278.3.
            (2) Transfer. If the chat is sold or otherwise transferred to another party, the acquirer shall provide a copy of the certification to the new owner of the chat. The new owner shall submit a certification according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The new certification supersedes all previous certifications.
            (3) Recordkeeping. The acquirer of chat, and any other person that receives the chat, will maintain copies of all of the following for three years; a copy of the certification following transmittal to the State department(s) of the environment, and, as appropriate; any SPLP testing results; or any site-specific risk assessments.

              [57 FR 41612, Sept. 10, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 26425, May 3, 1993; 59 FR 10559, Mar. 4, 1994; 71 FR 40280, July 14, 2006]
            
          
          
            Subpart B—Applicability
            
              § 279.10
              Applicability.
              This section identifies those materials which are subject to regulation as used oil under this part. This section also identifies some materials that are not subject to regulation as used oil under this part, and indicates whether these materials may be subject to regulation as hazardous waste under parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter.
              (a) Used oil. EPA presumes that used oil is to be recycled unless a used oil handler disposes of used oil, or sends used oil for disposal. Except as provided in § 279.11, the regulations of this part apply to used oil, and to materials identified in this section as being subject to regulation as used oil, whether or not the used oil or material exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.
              (b) Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste—(1) Listed hazardous waste. (i) Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter are subject to regulation as hazardous waste under parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter, rather than as used oil under this part.
              (ii) Rebuttable presumption for used oil. Used oil containing more than 1,000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. Persons may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).

              (A) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described in § 279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.
              
              (B) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.
              (2) Characteristic hazardous waste. Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that solely exhibit one or more of the hazardous waste characteristics identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter and mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D solely because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C are subject to:
              (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, regulation as hazardous waste under parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter rather than as used oil under this part, if the resultant mixture exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter; or
              (ii) Except as specified in § 279.10(b)(2)(iii) regulation as used oil under this part, if the resultant mixture does not exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste identified under subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.
              (iii) Regulation as used oil under this part, if the mixture is of used oil and a waste which is hazardous solely because it exhibits the characteristic of ignitability (e.g., ignitable-only mineral spirits), provided that the resultant mixture does not exhibit the characteristic of ignitability under § 261.21 of this chapter.
              (3) Very small quantity generator hazardous waste. Mixtures of used oil and very small quantity generator hazardous waste regulated under § 262.14 of this chapter are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.
              (c) Materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil from which the used oil has been properly drained or removed to the extent possible such that no visible signs of free-flowing oil remain in or on the material:
              (i) Are not used oil and thus not subject to this part, and
              (ii) If applicable are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of parts 124, 260 through 266, 268, and 270 of this chapter.
              (2) Materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil that are burned for energy recovery are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.
              (3) Used oil drained or removed from materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil is subject to regulation as used oil under this part.
              (d) Mixtures of used oil with products. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, mixtures of used oil and fuels or other fuel products are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.
              (2) Mixtures of used oil and diesel fuel mixed on-site by the generator of the used oil for use in the generator's own vehicles are not subject to this part once the used oil and diesel fuel have been mixed. Prior to mixing, the used oil is subject to the requirements of subpart C of this part.
              (e) Materials derived from used oil. (1) Materials that are reclaimed from used oil that are used beneficially and are not burned for energy recovery or used in a manner constituting disposal (e.g., re-refined lubricants) are:
              (i) Not used oil and thus are not subject to this part, and
              (ii) Not solid wastes and are thus not subject to the hazardous waste regulations of parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter as provided in § 261.3(c)(2)(i) of this chapter.
              (2) Materials produced from used oil that are burned for energy recovery (e.g., used oil fuels) are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.
              (3) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, materials derived from used oil that are disposed of or used in a manner constituting disposal are:
              (i) Not used oil and thus are not subject to this part, and

              (ii) Are solid wastes and thus are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter if the materials are listed or identified as hazardous wastes.
              (4) Used oil re-refining distillation bottoms that are used as feedstock to manufacture asphalt products are not subject to this part.
              (f) Wastewater. Wastewater, the discharge of which is subject to regulation under either section 402 or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act (including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater), contaminated with de minimis quantities of used oil are not subject to the requirements of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, “de minimis” quantities of used oils are defined as small spills, leaks, or drippings from pumps, machinery, pipes, and other similar equipment during normal operations or small amounts of oil lost to the wastewater treatment system during washing or draining operations. This exception will not apply if the used oil is discarded as a result of abnormal manufacturing operations resulting in substantial leaks, spills, or other releases, or to used oil recovered from wastewaters.
              (g) Used oil introduced into crude oil pipelines or a petroleum refining facility. (1) Used oil mixed with crude oil or natural gas liquids (e.g., in a production separator or crude oil stock tank) for insertion into a crude oil pipeline is exempt from the requirements of this part. The used oil is subject to the requirements of this part prior to the mixing of used oil with crude oil or natural gas liquids.
              (2) Mixtures of used oil and crude oil or natural gas liquids containing less than 1% used oil that are being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum refining facility for insertion into the refining process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the requirements of this part.
              (3) Used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining facility process before crude distillation or catalytic cracking without prior mixing with crude oil is exempt from the requirements of this part provided that the used oil constitutes less than 1% of the crude oil feed to any petroleum refining facility process unit at any given time. Prior to insertion into the petroleum refining facility process, the used oil is subject to the requirements of this part.
              (4) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, used oil that is introduced into a petroleum refining facility process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking is exempt from the requirements of this part only if the used oil meets the specification of § 279.11. Prior to insertion into the petroleum refining facility process, the used oil is subject to the requirements of this part.
              (5) Used oil that is incidentally captured by a hydrocarbon recovery system or wastewater treatment system as part of routine process operations at a petroleum refining facility and inserted into the petroleum refining facility process is exempt from the requirements of this part. This exemption does not extend to used oil which is intentionally introduced into a hydrocarbon recovery system (e.g., by pouring collected used oil into the waste water treatment system).
              (6) Tank bottoms from stock tanks containing exempt mixtures of used oil and crude oil or natural gas liquids are exempt from the requirements of this part.
              (h) Used oil on vessels. Used oil produced on vessels from normal shipboard operations is not subject to this part until it is transported ashore.
              (i) Used oil containing PCBs. Used oil containing PCBs (as defined at 40 CFR 761.3) at any concentration less than 50 ppm is subject to the requirements of this part unless, because of dilution, it is regulated under 40 CFR part 761 as a used oil containing PCBs at 50 ppm or greater. PCB-containing used oil subject to the requirements of this part may also be subject to the prohibitions and requirements found at 40 CFR part 761, including § 761.20(d) and (e). Used oil containing PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater is not subject to the requirements of this part, but is subject to regulation under 40 CFR part 761. No person may avoid these provisions by diluting used oil containing PCBs, unless otherwise specifically provided for in this part or part 761 of this chapter.

              Used oil specifications.
              Used oil burned for energy recovery, and any fuel produced from used oil by processing, blending, or other treatment, is subject to regulation under this part unless it is shown not to exceed any of the allowable levels of the constituents and properties shown in Table 1. Once used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery has been shown not to exceed any allowable level and the person making that showing complies with §§ 279.72, 279.73, and 279.74(b), the used oil is no longer subject to this part.

            Subpart C—Standards for Used Oil Generators
            
              § 279.20
              Applicability.
              (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, this subpart applies to all used oil generators. A used oil generator is any person, by site, whose act or process produces used oil or whose act first causes used oil to become subject to regulation.
              (1) Household “do-it-yourselfer” used oil generators. Household “do-it-yourselfer” used oil generators are not subject to regulation under this part.
              (2) Vessels. Vessels at sea or at port are not subject to this subpart. For purposes of this subpart, used oil produced on vessels from normal shipboard operations is considered to be generated at the time it is transported ashore. The owner or operator of the vessel and the person(s) removing or accepting used oil from the vessel are co-generators of the used oil and are both responsible for managing the waste in compliance with this subpart once the used oil is transported ashore. The co-genenerators may decide among them which party will fulfill the requirements of this subpart.
              (3) Diesel fuel. Mixtures of used oil and diesel fuel mixed by the generator of the used oil for use in the generator's own vehicles are not subject to this part once the used oil and diesel fuel have been mixed. Prior to mixing, the used oil fuel is subject to the requirements of this subpart.
              (4) Farmers. Farmers who generate an average of 25 gallons per month or less of used oil from vehicles or machinery used on the farm in a calendar year are not subject to the requirements of this part.
              (b) Other applicable provisions. Used oil generators who conduct the following activities are subject to the requirements of other applicable provisions of this part as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section:
              (1) Generators who transport used oil, except under the self-transport provisions of § 279.24 (a) and (b), must also comply with subpart E of this part.
              (2) (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, generators who process or re-refine used oil must also comply with subpart F of this part.
              (ii) Generators who perform the following activities are not processors provided that the used oil is generated on-site and is not being sent off-site to a burner of on- or off-specification used oil fuel.
              (A) Filtering, cleaning, or otherwise reconditioning used oil before returning it for reuse by the generator;
              (B) Separating used oil from wastewater generated on-site to make the wastewater acceptable for discharge or reuse pursuant to section 402 or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act or other applicable Federal or state regulations governing the management or discharge of wastewaters;
              (C) Using oil mist collectors to remove small droplets of used oil from in-plant air to make plant air suitable for continued recirculation;
              (D) Draining or otherwise removing used oil from materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil in order to remove excessive oil to the extent possible pursuant to § 279.10(c); or
              (E) Filtering, separating or otherwise reconditioning used oil before burning it in a space heater pursuant to § 279.23.
              (3) Generators who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery, except under the on-site space heater provisions of § 279.23, must also comply with subpart G of this part.
              (4) Generators who direct shipments of off-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner or first claim that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the used oil fuel specifications set forth in § 279.11 must also comply with subpart H of this part.
              (5) Generators who dispose of used oil, including the use of used oil as a dust suppressant, must also comply with subpart I of this part.

              § 279.21
              Hazardous waste mixing.
              (a) Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste must be managed in accordance with § 279.10(b).
              (b) The rebuttable presumption for used oil of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii) applies to used oil managed by generators. Under the rebuttable presumption for used oil of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), used oil containing greater than 1,000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste and thus must be managed as hazardous waste and not as used oil unless the presumption is rebutted. However, the rebuttable presumption does not apply to certain metalworking oils/fluids and certain used oils removed from refrigeration units.

              § 279.22
              Used oil storage.

              Used oil generators are subject to all applicable Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (40 CFR part 112) in addition to the requirements of this Subpart. Used oil generators are also subject to the Underground Storage Tank (40 CFR part 280) standards for used oil stored in underground tanks whether or not the used oil exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste, in addition to the requirements of this subpart.
              (a) Storage units. Used oil generators shall not store used oil in units other than tanks, containers, or units subject to regulation under parts 264 or 265 of this chapter.
              (b) Condition of units. Containers and aboveground tanks used to store used oil at generator facilities must be:
              (1) In good condition (no severe rusting, apparent structural defects or deterioration); and
              (2) Not leaking (no visible leaks).
              (c) Labels. (1) Containers and aboveground tanks used to store used oil at generator facilities must be labeled or marked clearly with the words “Used Oil.”
              (2) Fill pipes used to transfer used oil into underground storage tanks at generator facilities must be labeled or marked clearly with the words “Used Oil.”
              (d) Response to releases. Upon detection of a release of used oil to the environment that is not subject to the requirements of part 280, subpart F of this chapter and which has occurred after the effective date of the recycled used oil management program in effect in the State in which the release is located, a generator must perform the following cleanup steps:
              (1) Stop the release;
              (2) Contain the released used oil;
              (3) Clean up and manage properly the released used oil and other materials; and
              (4) If necessary, repair or replace any leaking used oil storage containers or tanks prior to returning them to service.

              § 279.24
              Off-site shipments.
              Except as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, generators must ensure that their used oil is transported only by transporters who have obtained EPA identification numbers.
              (a) Self-transportation of small amounts to approved collection centers. Generators may transport, without an EPA identification number, used oil that is generated at the generator's site and used oil collected from household do-it-yourselfers to a used oil collection center provided that:
              (1) The generator transports the used oil in a vehicle owned by the generator or owned by an employee of the generator;
              (2) The generator transports no more than 55 gallons of used oil at any time; and
              (3) The generator transports the used oil to a used oil collection center that is registered, licensed, permitted, or recognized by a state/county/municipal government to manage used oil.
              (b) Self-transportation of small amounts to aggregation points owned by the generator. Generators may transport, without an EPA identification number, used oil that is generated at the generator's site to an aggregation point provided that:
              (1) The generator transports the used oil in a vehicle owned by the generator or owned by an employee of the generator;
              (2) The generator transports no more than 55 gallons of used oil at any time; and
              (3) The generator transports the used oil to an aggregation point that is owned and/or operated by the same generator.
              (c) Tolling arrangements. Used oil generators may arrange for used oil to be transported by a transporter without an EPA identification number if the used oil is reclaimed under a contractual agreement pursuant to which reclaimed oil is returned by the processor/re-refiner to the generator for use as a lubricant, cutting oil, or coolant. The contract (known as a “tolling arrangement”) must indicate:
              (1) The type of used oil and the frequency of shipments;
              (2) That the vehicle used to transport the used oil to the processing/re-refining facility and to deliver recycled used oil back to the generator is owned and operated by the used oil processor/re-refiner; and
              (3) That reclaimed oil will be returned to the generator.

              § 279.40
              Applicability.
              (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, this subpart applies to all used oil transporters. Used oil transporters are persons who transport used oil, persons who collect used oil from more than one generator and transport the collected oil, and owners and operators of used oil transfer facilities.
              (1) This subpart does not apply to on-site transportation.
              (2) This subpart does not apply to generators who transport shipments of used oil totalling 55 gallons or less from the generator to a used oil collection center as specified in § 279.24(a).
              (3) This subpart does not apply to generators who transport shipments of used oil totalling 55 gallons or less from the generator to a used oil aggregation point owned or operated by the same generator as specified in § 279.24(b).

              (4) This subpart does not apply to transportation of used oil from household do-it-yourselfers to a regulated used oil generator, collection center, aggregation point, processor/re-refiner, or burner subject to the requirements of this part. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, this subpart does, however, apply to transportation of collected household do-it-yourselfer used oil from regulated used oil generators, collection centers, aggregation points, or other facilities where household do-it-yourselfer used oil is collected.
              (b) Imports and exports. Transporters who import used oil from abroad or export used oil outside of the United States are subject to the requirements of this subpart from the time the used oil enters and until the time it exits the United States.
              (c) Trucks used to transport hazardous waste. Unless trucks previously used to transport hazardous waste are emptied as described in § 261.7 of this chapter prior to transporting used oil, the used oil is considered to have been mixed with the hazardous waste and must be managed as hazardous waste unless, under the provisions of § 279.10(b), the hazardous waste/used oil mixture is determined not to be hazardous waste.
              (d) Other applicable provisions. Used oil transporters who conduct the following activities are also subject to other applicable provisions of this part as indicated in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section:
              (1) Transporters who generate used oil must also comply with subpart C of this part;
              (2) Transporters who process or re-refine used oil, except as provided in § 279.41, must also comply with subpart F of this part;
              (3) Transporters who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery must also comply with subpart G of this part;
              (4) Transporters who direct shipments of off-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner or first claim that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the used oil fuel specifications set forth in § 279.11 must also comply with subpart H of this part; and
              (5) Transporters who dispose of used oil, including the use of used oil as a dust suppressant, must also comply with subpart I of this part.

              § 279.43
              Used oil transportation.
              (a) Deliveries. A used oil transporter must deliver all used oil received to:
              (1) Another used oil transporter, provided that the transporter has obtained an EPA identification number;
              (2) A used oil processing/re-refining facility who has obtained an EPA identification number;
              (3) An off-specification used oil burner facility who has obtained an EPA identification number; or
              (4) An on-specification used oil burner facility.
              (b) DOT Requirements. Used oil transporters must comply with all applicable requirements under the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR parts 171 through 180. Persons transporting used oil that meets the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8 must comply with all applicable regulations in 49 CFR parts 171 through 180.
              (c) Used oil discharges. (1) In the event of a discharge of used oil during transportation, the transporter must take appropriate immediate action to protect human health and the environment (e.g., notify local authorities, dike the discharge area).
              (2) If a discharge of used oil occurs during transportation and an official (State or local government or a Federal Agency) acting within the scope of official responsibilities determines that immediate removal of the used oil is necessary to protect human health or the environment, that official may authorize the removal of the used oil by transporters who do not have EPA identification numbers.
              (3) An air, rail, highway, or water transporter who has discharged used oil must:
              (i) Give notice, if required by 49 CFR 171.15, to the National Response Center (800-424-8802 or 202-426-2675); and
              (ii) Report in writing as required by 49 CFR 171.16 to the Director, Office of Hazardous Materials Regulations, Materials Transportation Bureau, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
              (4) A water transporter who has discharged used oil must give notice as required by 33 CFR 153.203.
              (5) A transporter must clean up any used oil discharge that occurs during transportation or take such action as may be required or approved by federal, state, or local officials so that the used oil discharge no longer presents a hazard to human health or the environment.

              § 279.44
              Rebuttable presumption for used oil.
              (a) To ensure that used oil is not a hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), the used oil transporter must determine whether the total halogen content of used oil being transported or stored at a transfer facility is above or below 1,000 ppm.
              (b) The transporter must make this determination by:
              (1) Testing the used oil; or
              (2) Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes used.
              (c) If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).

              (1) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described in § 279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.
              (2) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units if the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.
              (d) Record retention. Records of analyses conducted or information used to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must be maintained by the transporter for at least 3 years.

              § 279.52
              General facility standards.
              (a) Preparedness and prevention. Owners and operators of used oil processing and re-refining facilities must comply with the following requirements:
              (1) Maintenance and operation of facility. Facilities must be maintained and operated to minimize the possibility of a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to air, soil, or surface water which could threaten human health or the environment.
              (2) Required equipment. All facilities must be equipped with the following, unless none of the hazards posed by used oil handled at the facility could require a particular kind of equipment specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section:
              (i) An internal communications or alarm system capable of providing immediate emergency instruction (voice or signal) to facility personnel;
              (ii) A device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of operations) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning emergency assistance from local police departments, fire departments, or State or local emergency response teams;
              (iii) Portable fire extinguishers, fire control equipment (including special extinguishing equipment, such as that using foam, inert gas, or dry chemicals), spill control equipment and decontamination equipment; and
              (iv) Water at adequate volume and pressure to supply water hose streams, or foam producing equipment, or automatic sprinklers, or water spray systems.
              (3) Testing and maintenance of equipment. All facility communications or alarm systems, fire protection equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment, where required, must be tested and maintained as necessary to assure its proper operation in time of emergency.
              (4) Access to communications or alarm system. (i) Whenever used oil is being poured, mixed, spread, or otherwise handled, all personnel involved in the operation must have immediate access to an internal alarm or emergency communication device, either directly or through visual or voice contact with another employee, unless such a device is not required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (ii) If there is ever just one employee on the premises while the facility is operating, the employee must have immediate access to a device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of operation) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning external emergency assistance, unless such a device is not required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (5) Required aisle space. The owner or operator must maintain aisle space to allow the unobstructed movement of personnel, fire protection equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment to any area of facility operation in an emergency, unless aisle space is not needed for any of these purposes.
              (6) Arrangements with local authorities. (i) The owner or operator must attempt to make the following arrangements, as appropriate for the type of used oil handled at the facility and the potential need for the services of these organizations:
              (A) Arrangements to familiarize police, fire departments, and emergency response teams with the layout of the facility, properties of used oil handled at the facility and associated hazards, places where facility personnel would normally be working, entrances to roads inside the facility, and possible evacuation routes;
              (B) Where more than one police and fire department might respond to an emergency, agreements designating primary emergency authority to a specific police and a specific fire department, and agreements with any others to provide support to the primary emergency authority;
              (C) Agreements with State emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, and equipment suppliers; and
              (D) Arrangements to familiarize local hospitals with the properties of used oil handled at the facility and the types of injuries or illnesses which could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the facility.
              (ii) Where State or local authorities decline to enter into such arrangements, the owner or operator must document the refusal in the operating record.
              (b) Contingency plan and emergency procedures. Owners and operators of used oil processing and re-refining facilities must comply with the following requirements:
              (1) Purpose and implementation of contingency plan. (i) Each owner or operator must have a contingency plan for the facility. The contingency plan must be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to air, soil, or surface water.

              (ii) The provisions of the plan must be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of used oil which could threaten human health or the environment.
              (2) Content of contingency plan. (i) The contingency plan must describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with paragraphs (b) (1) and (6) of this section in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.
              (ii) If the owner or operator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with part 112 of this chapter, or part 1510 of chapter V of this title, or some other emergency or contingency plan, the owner or operator need only amend that plan to incorporate used oil management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the requirements of this part.
              (iii) The plan must describe arrangements agreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
              (iv) The plan must list names, addresses, and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see paragraph (b)(5) of this section), and this list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates.
              (v) The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.
              (vi) The plan must include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of used oil or fires).
              (3) Copies of contingency plan. A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan must be:
              (i) Maintained at the facility; and
              (ii) Submitted to all local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services.
              (4) Amendment of contingency plan. The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever:
              (i) Applicable regulations are revised;
              (ii) The plan fails in an emergency;
              (iii) The facility changes—in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances—in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of used oil, or changes the response necessary in an emergency;
              (iv) The list of emergency coordinators changes; or
              (v) The list of emergency equipment changes.
              (5) Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on call (i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristic of used oil handled, the location of all records within the facility, and facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan.
              
                Guidance: The emergency coordinator's responsibilities are more fully spelled out in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Applicable responsibilities for the emergency coordinator vary, depending on factors such as type and variety of used oil handled by the facility, and type and complexity of the facility.
              
              (6) Emergency procedures. (i) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or the designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:
              (A) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and
              (B) Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.
              (ii) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analyses.
              (iii) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).
              (iv) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as follows:
              (A) If his assessment indicated that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and
              (B) He must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for the geographical area (in the applicable regional contingency plan under part 1510 of this title), or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/424-8802). The report must include:
              (1) Name and telephone number of reporter;
              (2) Name and address of facility;
              (3) Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire);
              (4) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;
              (5) The extent of injuries, if any; and
              (6) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.
              (v) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other used oil or hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operation, collecting and containing released used oil, and removing or isolating containers.
              (vi) If the facility stops operation in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.
              (vii) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for recycling, storing, or disposing of recovered used oil, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.
              (viii) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:
              (A) No waste or used oil that may be incompatible with the released material is recycled, treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and
              (B) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.
              (C) The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator, and appropriate State and local authorities that the facility is in compliance with paragraphs (b)(6)(viii)(A) and (B) of this section before operations are resumed in the affected area(s) of the facility.

              (ix) The owner or operator must note in the operating record the time, date and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he must submit a written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. The report must include:
              (A) Name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator;
              (B) Name, address, and telephone number of the facility;
              (C) Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion);
              (D) Name and quantity of material(s) involved;
              (E) The extent of injuries, if any;
              (F) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable;
              (G) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.

              § 279.53
              Rebuttable presumption for used oil.
              (a) To ensure that used oil managed at a processing/re-refining facility is not hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), the owner or operator of a used oil processing/re-refining facility must determine whether the total halogen content of used oil managed at the facility is above or below 1,000 ppm.
              (b) The owner or operator must make this determination by:
              (1) Testing the used oil; or
              (2) Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes used.
              (c) If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).
              (1) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling agreement, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.
              (2) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.

              § 279.63
              Rebuttable presumption for used oil.
              (a) To ensure that used oil managed at a used oil burner facility is not hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), a used oil burner must determine whether the total halogen content of used oil managed at the facility is above or below 1,000 ppm.
              (b) The used oil burner must determine if the used oil contains above or below 1,000 ppm total halogens by:
              (1) Testing the used oil;
              (2) Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes used; or

              (3) If the used oil has been received from a processor/re-refiner subject to regulation under subpart F of this part, using information provided by the processor/re-refiner.
              
              (c) If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).
              (1) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described in § 279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.
              (2) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.
              (d) Record retention. Records of analyses conducted or information used to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must be maintained by the burner for at least 3 years.

            Subpart H—Standards for Used Oil Fuel Marketers
            
              § 279.70
              Applicability.
              (a) Any person who conducts either of the following activities is subject to the requirements of this subpart:

              (1) Directs a shipment of off-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner; or
              
              (2) First claims that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the used oil fuel specifications set forth in § 279.11.
              (b) The following persons are not marketers subject to this subpart:
              (1) Used oil generators, and transporters who transport used oil received only from generators, unless the generator or transporter directs a shipment of off-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner. However, processors/re-refiners who burn some used oil fuel for purposes of processing are considered to be burning incidentally to processing. Thus, generators and transporters who direct shipments of off-specification used oil to processor/re-refiners who incidentally burn used oil are not marketers subject to this Subpart;
              (2) Persons who direct shipments of on-specification used oil and who are not the first person to claim the oil meets the used oil fuel specifications of § 279.11.
              (c) Any person subject to the requirements of this Subpart must also comply with one of the following:
              (1) Subpart C of this part—Standards for Used Oil Generators;
              (2) Subpart E of this part—Standards for Used Oil Transporters and Transfer Facilities;
              (3) Subpart F of this part—Standards for Used Oil Processors and Re-refiners; or
              (4) Subpart G of this part—Standards for Used Oil Burners who Burn Off-Specification Used Oil for Energy Recovery.

              § 279.71
              Prohibitions.
              A used oil fuel marketer may initiate a shipment of off-specification used oil only to a used oil burner who:
              (a) Has an EPA identification number; and
              (b) Burns the used oil in an industrial furnace or boiler identified in § 279.61(a).
            
            
              § 279.72
              On-specification used oil fuel.
              (a) Analysis of used oil fuel. A generator, transporter, processor/re-refiner, or burner may determine that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the fuel specifications of § 279.11 by performing analyses or obtaining copies of analyses or other information documenting that the used oil fuel meets the specifications.
              (b) Record retention. A generator, transporter, processor/re-refiner, or burner who first claims that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the specifications for used oil fuel under § 279.11, must keep copies of analyses of the used oil (or other information used to make the determination) for three years.

              § 279.73
              Notification.
              (a) Identification numbers. A used oil fuel marketer subject to the requirements of this subpart who has not previously complied with the notification requirements of RCRA section 3010 must comply with these requirements and obtain an EPA identification number.
              (b) A marketer who has not received an EPA identification number may obtain one by notifying the Regional Administrator of their used oil activity by submitting either:
              (1) A completed EPA Form 8700-12; or
              (2) A letter requesting an EPA identification number. The letter should include the following information:

              (i) Pressurized piping must be monitored for releases at least every 30 days in accordance with § 280.43(g) and be equipped with an automatic line leak detector in accordance with § 280.44(a)
              (ii) Suction piping must be monitored for releases at least every 30 days in accordance with § 280.43(g). No release detection is required for suction piping that meets paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section.
            
            
              § 280.42
              Requirements for hazardous substance UST systems.
              Owners and operators of hazardous substance UST systems must provide containment that meets the following requirements and monitor these systems using § 280.43(g) at least every 30 days:
              (a) Secondary containment systems must be designed, constructed, and installed to:

              (2) Prevent the interference of precipitation or groundwater intrusion with the ability to contain or detect a release of regulated substances; and
              (3) Surround the tank completely (i.e., it is capable of preventing lateral as well as vertical migration of regulated substances).
              (d) Underground piping must be equipped with secondary containment that satisfies the requirements of this section (e.g., trench liners, double walled pipe). In addition, underground piping that conveys regulated substances under pressure must be equipped with an automatic line leak detector in accordance with § 280.44(a).
              (e) For hazardous substance UST systems installed on or before October 13, 2015 other methods of release detection may be used if owners and operators:
              (1) Demonstrate to the implementing agency that an alternate method can detect a release of the stored substance as effectively as any of the methods allowed in § 280.43(b) through (i) can detect a release of petroleum;

              (2) Provide information to the implementing agency on effective corrective action technologies, health risks, and chemical and physical properties of the stored substance, and the characteristics of the UST site; and,
              (3) Obtain approval from the implementing agency to use the alternate release detection method before the installation and operation of the new UST system.
            
            
              § 280.43
              Methods of release detection for tanks.
              Each method of release detection for tanks used to meet the requirements of § 280.41 must be conducted in accordance with the following:
              (a) Inventory control. Product inventory control (or another test of equivalent performance) must be conducted monthly to detect a release of at least 1.0 percent of flow-through plus 130 gallons on a monthly basis in the following manner:
              (1) Inventory volume measurements for regulated substance inputs, withdrawals, and the amount still remaining in the tank are recorded each operating day;
              (2) The equipment used is capable of measuring the level of product over the full range of the tank's height to the nearest one-eighth of an inch;
              (3) The regulated substance inputs are reconciled with delivery receipts by measurement of the tank inventory volume before and after delivery;
              (4) Deliveries are made through a drop tube that extends to within one foot of the tank bottom;
              (5) Product dispensing is metered and recorded within the local standards for meter calibration or an accuracy of 6 cubic inches for every 5 gallons of product withdrawn; and

              (6) The measurement of any water level in the bottom of the tank is made to the nearest one-eighth of an inch at least once a month.
              
              
                Note to paragraph (a).
                Practices described in the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice RP 1621, “Bulk Liquid Stock Control at Retail Outlets” may be used, where applicable, as guidance in meeting the requirements of this paragraph (a).
              
              
              (b) Manual tank gauging. Manual tank gauging must meet the following requirements:
              (1) Tank liquid level measurements are taken at the beginning and ending of a period using the appropriate minimum duration of test value in the table below during which no liquid is added to or removed from the tank;
              (2) Level measurements are based on an average of two consecutive stick readings at both the beginning and ending of the period;
              (3) The equipment used is capable of measuring the level of product over the full range of the tank's height to the nearest one-eighth of an inch;
              (4) A release is suspected and subject to the requirements of subpart E if the variation between beginning and ending measurements exceeds the weekly or monthly standards in the following table:
              
                
                  Nominal tank capacity
                  Minimumduration of test
                  
                  Weekly standard(one test)
                  
                  Monthly standard(four test
                    average)
                  
                
                
                  550 gallons or less
                  36 hours
                  10 gallons
                  5 gallons
                
                
                  551-1,000 gallons (when tank diameter is 64 inches)
                  44 hours
                  9 gallons
                  4 gallons
                
                
                  551-1,000 gallons (when tank diameter is 48 inches)
                  58 hours
                  12 gallons
                  6 gallons
                
                
                  551-1,000 gallons (also requires periodic tank tightness testing)
                  36 hours
                  13 gallons
                  7 gallons
                
                
                  1,001-2,000 gallons (also requires periodic tank tightness testing)
                  36 hours
                  26 gallons
                  13 gallons
                
              
              (5) Tanks of 550 gallons or less nominal capacity and tanks with a nominal capacity of 551 to 1,000 gallons that meet the tank diameter criteria in the table in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may use this as the sole method of release detection. All other tanks with a nominal capacity of 551 to 2,000 gallons may use the method in place of inventory control in § 280.43(a). Tanks of greater than 2,000 gallons nominal capacity may not use this method to meet the requirements of this subpart.
              (c) Tank tightness testing. Tank tightness testing (or another test of equivalent performance) must be capable of detecting a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product while accounting for the effects of thermal expansion or contraction of the product, vapor pockets, tank deformation, evaporation or condensation, and the location of the water table.
              (d) Automatic tank gauging. Equipment for automatic tank gauging that tests for the loss of product and conducts inventory control must meet the following requirements:
              (1) The automatic product level monitor test can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product;
              (2) The automatic tank gauging equipment must meet the inventory control (or other test of equivalent performance) requirements of § 280.43(a); and
              (3) The test must be performed with the system operating in one of the following modes:
              (i) In-tank static testing conducted at least once every 30 days; or
              (ii) Continuous in-tank leak detection operating on an uninterrupted basis or operating within a process that allows the system to gather incremental measurements to determine the leak status of the tank at least once every 30 days.
              (e) Vapor monitoring. Testing or monitoring for vapors within the soil gas of the excavation zone must meet the following requirements:
              (1) The materials used as backfill are sufficiently porous (e.g., gravel, sand, crushed rock) to readily allow diffusion of vapors from releases into the excavation area;
              (2) The stored regulated substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system, is sufficiently volatile (e.g., gasoline) to result in a vapor level that is detectable by the monitoring devices located in the excavation zone in the event of a release from the tank;
              (3) The measurement of vapors by the monitoring device is not rendered inoperative by the groundwater, rainfall, or soil moisture or other known interferences so that a release could go undetected for more than 30 days;
              (4) The level of background contamination in the excavation zone will not interfere with the method used to detect releases from the tank;
              (5) The vapor monitors are designed and operated to detect any significant increase in concentration above background of the regulated substance stored in the tank system, a component or components of that substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system;
              (6) In the UST excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring wells that will detect releases within the excavation zone from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and
              (7) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering.
              (f) Groundwater monitoring. Testing or monitoring for liquids on the groundwater must meet the following requirements:
              (1) The regulated substance stored is immiscible in water and has a specific gravity of less than one;
              (2) Groundwater is never more than 20 feet from the ground surface and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil(s) between the UST system and the monitoring wells or devices is not less than 0.01 cm/sec (e.g., the soil should consist of gravels, coarse to medium sands, coarse silts or other permeable materials);
              (3) The slotted portion of the monitoring well casing must be designed to prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack into the well and to allow entry of regulated substance on the water table into the well under both high and low groundwater conditions;
              (4) Monitoring wells shall be sealed from the ground surface to the top of the filter pack;
              (5) Monitoring wells or devices intercept the excavation zone or are as close to it as is technically feasible;
              (6) The continuous monitoring devices or manual methods used can detect the presence of at least one-eighth of an inch of free product on top of the groundwater in the monitoring wells;

              (7) Within and immediately below the UST system excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will detect releases from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and
              (8) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering.
              (g) Interstitial monitoring. Interstitial monitoring between the UST system and a secondary barrier immediately around or beneath it may be used, but only if the system is designed, constructed, and installed to detect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product and also meets one of the following requirements:
              (1) For double walled UST systems, the sampling or testing method can detect a leak through the inner wall in any portion of the tank that routinely contains product;
              (2) For UST systems with a secondary barrier within the excavation zone, the sampling or testing method used can detect a leak between the UST system and the secondary barrier;

              (i) The secondary barrier around or beneath the UST system consists of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and impermeable (at least 10−6 cm/sec for the regulated substance stored) to direct a leak to the monitoring point and permit its detection;
              (ii) The barrier is compatible with the regulated substance stored so that a leak from the UST system will not cause a deterioration of the barrier allowing a release to pass through undetected;
              (iii) For cathodically protected tanks, the secondary barrier must be installed so that it does not interfere with the proper operation of the cathodic protection system;
              (iv) The groundwater, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling method used inoperative so that a release could go undetected for more than 30 days;
              (v) The site is assessed to ensure that the secondary barrier is always above the groundwater and not in a 25-year flood plain, unless the barrier and monitoring designs are for use under such conditions; and,
              (vi) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering.
              (3) For tanks with an internally fitted liner, an automated device can detect a leak between the inner wall of the tank and the liner, and the liner is compatible with the substance stored.
              (h) Statistical inventory reconciliation. Release detection methods based on the application of statistical principles to inventory data similar to those described in § 280.43(a) must meet the following requirements:
              (1) Report a quantitative result with a calculated leak rate;
              (2) Be capable of detecting a leak rate of 0.2 gallon per hour or a release of 150 gallons within 30 days; and
              (3) Use a threshold that does not exceed one-half the minimum detectible leak rate.
              (i) Other methods. Any other type of release detection method, or combination of methods, can be used if:
              (1) It can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate or a release of 150 gallons within a month with a probability of detection of 0.95 and a probability of false alarm of 0.05; or
              (2) The implementing agency may approve another method if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability with which it can be detected. If the method is approved, the owner and operator must comply with any conditions imposed by the implementing agency on its use to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.
            
            
              § 280.44
              Methods of release detection for piping.
              Each method of release detection for piping used to meet the requirements of § 280.41 must be conducted in accordance with the following:
              (a) Automatic line leak detectors. Methods which alert the operator to the presence of a leak by restricting or shutting off the flow of regulated substances through piping or triggering an audible or visual alarm may be used only if they detect leaks of 3 gallons per hour at 10 pounds per square inch line pressure within 1 hour. An annual test of the operation of the leak detector must be conducted in accordance with § 280.40(a)(3).
              (b) Line tightness testing. A periodic test of piping may be conducted only if it can detect a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at one and one-half times the operating pressure.
              (c) Applicable tank methods. Except as described in § 280.41(a), any of the methods in § 280.43(e) through (i) may be used if they are designed to detect a release from any portion of the underground piping that routinely contains regulated substances.
            
            
              § 280.45
              Release detection recordkeeping.
              All UST system owners and operators must maintain records in accordance with § 280.34 demonstrating compliance with all applicable requirements of this subpart. These records must include the following:
              (a) All written performance claims pertaining to any release detection system used, and the manner in which these claims have been justified or tested by the equipment manufacturer or installer, must be maintained for 5 years, or for another reasonable period of time determined by the implementing agency, from the date of installation. Not later than October 13, 2018, records of site assessments required under § 280.43(e)(6) and (f)(7) must be maintained for as long as the methods are used. Records of site assessments developed after October 13, 2015 must be signed by a professional engineer or professional geologist, or equivalent licensed professional with experience in environmental engineering, hydrogeology, or other relevant technical discipline acceptable to the implementing agency;
              (b) The results of any sampling, testing, or monitoring must be maintained for at least one year, or for another reasonable period of time determined by the implementing agency, except as follows:
              (1) The results of annual operation tests conducted in accordance with § 280.40(a)(3) must be maintained for three years. At a minimum, the results must list each component tested, indicate whether each component tested meets criteria in § 280.40(a)(3) or needs to have action taken, and describe any action taken to correct an issue; and
              (2) The results of tank tightness testing conducted in accordance with § 280.43(c) must be retained until the next test is conducted; and
              (3) The results of tank tightness testing, line tightness testing, and vapor monitoring using a tracer compound placed in the tank system conducted in accordance with § 280.252(d) must be retained until the next test is conducted; and
              (c) Written documentation of all calibration, maintenance, and repair of release detection equipment permanently located on-site must be maintained for at least one year after the servicing work is completed, or for another reasonable time period determined by the implementing agency. Any schedules of required calibration and maintenance provided by the release detection equipment manufacturer must be retained for five years from the date of installation.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Release Reporting, Investigation, and Confirmation
            
              § 280.50
              Reporting of suspected releases.
              Owners and operators of UST systems must report to the implementing agency within 24 hours, or another reasonable period specified by the implementing agency, and follow the procedures in § 280.52 for any of the following conditions:
              (a) The discovery by owners and operators or others of released regulated substances at the UST site or in the surrounding area (such as the presence of free product or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility lines, and nearby surface water).

              (b) Unusual operating conditions observed by owners and operators (such as the erratic behavior of product dispensing equipment, the sudden loss of product from the UST system, an unexplained presence of water in the tank, or liquid in the interstitial space of secondarily contained systems), unless:
              
              (1) The system equipment or component is found not to be releasing regulated substances to the environment;
              (2) Any defective system equipment or component is immediately repaired or replaced; and
              (3) For secondarily contained systems, except as provided for in § 280.43(g)(2)(iv), any liquid in the interstitial space not used as part of the interstitial monitoring method (for example, brine filled) is immediately removed.
              (c) Monitoring results, including investigation of an alarm, from a release detection method required under §§ 280.41 and 280.42 that indicate a release may have occurred unless:
              (1) The monitoring device is found to be defective, and is immediately repaired, recalibrated or replaced, and additional monitoring does not confirm the initial result;
              (2) The leak is contained in the secondary containment and:
              (i) Except as provided for in § 280.43(g)(2)(iv), any liquid in the interstitial space not used as part of the interstitial monitoring method (for example, brine filled) is immediately removed; and
              (ii) Any defective system equipment or component is immediately repaired or replaced;
              (3) In the case of inventory control described in § 280.43(a), a second month of data does not confirm the initial result or the investigation determines no release has occurred; or
              (4) The alarm was investigated and determined to be a non-release event (for example, from a power surge or caused by filling the tank during release detection testing).
            
            
              § 280.51
              Investigation due to off-site impacts.
              When required by the implementing agency, owners and operators of UST systems must follow the procedures in § 280.52 to determine if the UST system is the source of off-site impacts. These impacts include the discovery of regulated substances (such as the presence of free product or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility lines, and nearby surface and drinking waters) that has been observed by the implementing agency or brought to its attention by another party.
            
            
              § 280.52
              Release investigation and confirmation steps.
              Unless corrective action is initiated in accordance with subpart F, owners and operators must immediately investigate and confirm all suspected releases of regulated substances requiring reporting under § 280.50 within 7 days, or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, using either the following steps or another procedure approved by the implementing agency:
              (a) System test. Owners and operators must conduct tests (according to the requirements for tightness testing in §§ 280.43(c) and 280.44(b) or, as appropriate, secondary containment testing described in § 280.33(d)).
              (1) The test must determine whether:
              (i) A leak exists in that portion of the tank that routinely contains product, or the attached delivery piping; or
              (ii) A breach of either wall of the secondary containment has occurred.
              (2) If the system test confirms a leak into the interstice or a release, owners and operators must repair, replace, upgrade, or close the UST system. In addition, owners and operators must begin corrective action in accordance with subpart F of this part if the test results for the system, tank, or delivery piping indicate that a release exists.
              (3) Further investigation is not required if the test results for the system, tank, and delivery piping do not indicate that a release exists and if environmental contamination is not the basis for suspecting a release.
              (4) Owners and operators must conduct a site check as described in paragraph (b) of this section if the test results for the system, tank, and delivery piping do not indicate that a release exists but environmental contamination is the basis for suspecting a release.
              (b) Site check. Owners and operators must measure for the presence of a release where contamination is most likely to be present at the UST site. In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, owners and operators must consider the nature of the stored substance, the type of initial alarm or cause for suspicion, the type of backfill, the depth of groundwater, and other factors appropriate for identifying the presence and source of the release.
              (1) If the test results for the excavation zone or the UST site indicate that a release has occurred, owners and operators must begin corrective action in accordance with subpart F of this part;
              (2) If the test results for the excavation zone or the UST site do not indicate that a release has occurred, further investigation is not required.
            
            
              § 280.53
              Reporting and cleanup of spills and overfills.
              (a) Owners and operators of UST systems must contain and immediately clean up a spill or overfill and report to the implementing agency within 24 hours, or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, and begin corrective action in accordance with subpart F of this part in the following cases:
              (1) Spill or overfill of petroleum that results in a release to the environment that exceeds 25 gallons or another reasonable amount specified by the implementing agency, or that causes a sheen on nearby surface water; and

              (2) Spill or overfill of a hazardous substance that results in a release to the environment that equals or exceeds its reportable quantity under CERCLA (40 CFR part 302).
              
              
                Note to paragraph (a).
                Pursuant to §§ 302.6 and 355.40 of this chapter, a release of a hazardous substance equal to or in excess of its reportable quantity must also be reported immediately (rather than within 24 hours) to the National Response Center under sections 102 and 103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and to appropriate state and local authorities under Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986.
              
              
              (b) Owners and operators of UST systems must contain and immediately clean up a spill or overfill of petroleum that is less than 25 gallons or another reasonable amount specified by the implementing agency, and a spill or overfill of a hazardous substance that is less than the reportable quantity. If cleanup cannot be accomplished within 24 hours, or another reasonable time period established by the implementing agency, owners and operators must immediately notify the implementing agency.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Release Response and Corrective Action for UST Systems Containing Petroleum or Hazardous Substances
            
              § 280.60
              General.
              Owners and operators of petroleum or hazardous substance UST systems must, in response to a confirmed release from the UST system, comply with the requirements of this subpart except for USTs excluded under § 280.10(b) and UST systems subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action requirements under section 3004(u) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended.
            
            
              § 280.61
              Initial response.
              Upon confirmation of a release in accordance with § 280.52 or after a release from the UST system is identified in any other manner, owners and operators must perform the following initial response actions within 24 hours of a release or within another reasonable period of time determined by the implementing agency:
              (a) Report the release to the implementing agency (e.g., by telephone or electronic mail);
              (b) Take immediate action to prevent any further release of the regulated substance into the environment; and
              (c) Identify and mitigate fire, explosion, and vapor hazards.
            
            
              § 280.62
              Initial abatement measures and site check.
              (a) Unless directed to do otherwise by the implementing agency, owners and operators must perform the following abatement measures:

              (1) Remove as much of the regulated substance from the UST system as is necessary to prevent further release to the environment;
              
              (2) Visually inspect any aboveground releases or exposed belowground releases and prevent further migration of the released substance into surrounding soils and groundwater;
              (3) Continue to monitor and mitigate any additional fire and safety hazards posed by vapors or free product that have migrated from the UST excavation zone and entered into subsurface structures (such as sewers or basements);
              (4) Remedy hazards posed by contaminated soils that are excavated or exposed as a result of release confirmation, site investigation, abatement, or corrective action activities. If these remedies include treatment or disposal of soils, the owner and operator must comply with applicable state and local requirements;
              (5) Measure for the presence of a release where contamination is most likely to be present at the UST site, unless the presence and source of the release have been confirmed in accordance with the site check required by § 280.52(b) or the closure site assessment of § 280.72(a). In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, the owner and operator must consider the nature of the stored substance, the type of backfill, depth to groundwater and other factors as appropriate for identifying the presence and source of the release; and
              (6) Investigate to determine the possible presence of free product, and begin free product removal as soon as practicable and in accordance with § 280.64.
              (b) Within 20 days after release confirmation, or within another reasonable period of time determined by the implementing agency, owners and operators must submit a report to the implementing agency summarizing the initial abatement steps taken under paragraph (a) of this section and any resulting information or data.
            
            
              § 280.63
              Initial site characterization.
              (a) Unless directed to do otherwise by the implementing agency, owners and operators must assemble information about the site and the nature of the release, including information gained while confirming the release or completing the initial abatement measures in §§ 280.60 and 280.61. This information must include, but is not necessarily limited to the following:
              (1) Data on the nature and estimated quantity of release;
              (2) Data from available sources and/or site investigations concerning the following factors: Surrounding populations, water quality, use and approximate locations of wells potentially affected by the release, subsurface soil conditions, locations of subsurface sewers, climatological conditions, and land use;
              (3) Results of the site check required under § 280.62(a)(5); and
              (4) Results of the free product investigations required under § 280.62(a)(6), to be used by owners and operators to determine whether free product must be recovered under § 280.64.
              (b) Within 45 days of release confirmation or another reasonable period of time determined by the implementing agency, owners and operators must submit the information collected in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section to the implementing agency in a manner that demonstrates its applicability and technical adequacy, or in a format and according to the schedule required by the implementing agency.
            
            
              § 280.64
              Free product removal.
              At sites where investigations under § 280.62(a)(6) indicate the presence of free product, owners and operators must remove free product to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the implementing agency while continuing, as necessary, any actions initiated under §§ 280.61 through 280.63, or preparing for actions required under §§ 280.65 through 280.66. In meeting the requirements of this section, owners and operators must:
              (a) Conduct free product removal in a manner that minimizes the spread of contamination into previously uncontaminated zones by using recovery and disposal techniques appropriate to the hydrogeologic conditions at the site, and that properly treats, discharges or disposes of recovery byproducts in compliance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations;

              (b) Use abatement of free product migration as a minimum objective for the design of the free product removal system;
              (c) Handle any flammable products in a safe and competent manner to prevent fires or explosions; and
              (d) Unless directed to do otherwise by the implementing agency, prepare and submit to the implementing agency, within 45 days after confirming a release, a free product removal report that provides at least the following information:
              (1) The name of the person(s) responsible for implementing the free product removal measures;
              (2) The estimated quantity, type, and thickness of free product observed or measured in wells, boreholes, and excavations;
              (3) The type of free product recovery system used;
              (4) Whether any discharge will take place on-site or off-site during the recovery operation and where this discharge will be located;
              (5) The type of treatment applied to, and the effluent quality expected from, any discharge;
              (6) The steps that have been or are being taken to obtain necessary permits for any discharge; and
              (7) The disposition of the recovered free product.
            
            
              § 280.65
              Investigations for soil and groundwater cleanup.
              (a) In order to determine the full extent and location of soils contaminated by the release and the presence and concentrations of dissolved product contamination in the groundwater, owners and operators must conduct investigations of the release, the release site, and the surrounding area possibly affected by the release if any of the following conditions exist:
              (1) There is evidence that groundwater wells have been affected by the release (e.g., as found during release confirmation or previous corrective action measures);
              (2) Free product is found to need recovery in compliance with § 280.64;
              (3) There is evidence that contaminated soils may be in contact with groundwater (e.g., as found during conduct of the initial response measures or investigations required under §§ 280.60 through 280.64); and
              (4) The implementing agency requests an investigation, based on the potential effects of contaminated soil or groundwater on nearby surface water and groundwater resources.
              (b) Owners and operators must submit the information collected under paragraph (a) of this section as soon as practicable or in accordance with a schedule established by the implementing agency.
            
            
              § 280.66
              Corrective action plan.
              (a) At any point after reviewing the information submitted in compliance with §§ 280.61 through 280.63, the implementing agency may require owners and operators to submit additional information or to develop and submit a corrective action plan for responding to contaminated soils and groundwater. If a plan is required, owners and operators must submit the plan according to a schedule and format established by the implementing agency. Alternatively, owners and operators may, after fulfilling the requirements of §§ 280.61 through 280.63, choose to submit a corrective action plan for responding to contaminated soil and groundwater. In either case, owners and operators are responsible for submitting a plan that provides for adequate protection of human health and the environment as determined by the implementing agency, and must modify their plan as necessary to meet this standard.
              (b) The implementing agency will approve the corrective action plan only after ensuring that implementation of the plan will adequately protect human health, safety, and the environment. In making this determination, the implementing agency should consider the following factors as appropriate:
              (1) The physical and chemical characteristics of the regulated substance, including its toxicity, persistence, and potential for migration;
              (2) The hydrogeologic characteristics of the facility and the surrounding area;
              (3) The proximity, quality, and current and future uses of nearby surface water and groundwater;

              (4) The potential effects of residual contamination on nearby surface water and groundwater;
              
              (5) An exposure assessment; and
              (6) Any information assembled in compliance with this subpart.
              (c) Upon approval of the corrective action plan or as directed by the implementing agency, owners and operators must implement the plan, including modifications to the plan made by the implementing agency. They must monitor, evaluate, and report the results of implementing the plan in accordance with a schedule and in a format established by the implementing agency.
              (d) Owners and operators may, in the interest of minimizing environmental contamination and promoting more effective cleanup, begin cleanup of soil and groundwater before the corrective action plan is approved provided that they:
              (1) Notify the implementing agency of their intention to begin cleanup;
              (2) Comply with any conditions imposed by the implementing agency, including halting cleanup or mitigating adverse consequences from cleanup activities; and
              (3) Incorporate these self-initiated cleanup measures in the corrective action plan that is submitted to the implementing agency for approval.
            
            
              § 280.67
              Public participation.
              (a) For each confirmed release that requires a corrective action plan, the implementing agency must provide notice to the public by means designed to reach those members of the public directly affected by the release and the planned corrective action. This notice may include, but is not limited to, public notice in local newspapers, block advertisements, public service announcements, publication in a state register, letters to individual households, or personal contacts by field staff.
              (b) The implementing agency must ensure that site release information and decisions concerning the corrective action plan are made available to the public for inspection upon request.
              (c) Before approving a corrective action plan, the implementing agency may hold a public meeting to consider comments on the proposed corrective action plan if there is sufficient public interest, or for any other reason.
              (d) The implementing agency must give public notice that complies with paragraph (a) of this section if implementation of an approved corrective action plan does not achieve the established cleanup levels in the plan and termination of that plan is under consideration by the implementing agency.
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure
            
              § 280.70
              Temporary closure.
              (a) When an UST system is temporarily closed, owners and operators must continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection in accordance with § 280.31, and any release detection in accordance with subparts D and K of this part. Subparts E and F of this part must be complied with if a release is suspected or confirmed. However, release detection and release detection operation and maintenance testing and inspections in subparts C and D of this part are not required as long as the UST system is empty. The UST system is empty when all materials have been removed using commonly employed practices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue, or 0.3 percent by weight of the total capacity of the UST system, remain in the system. In addition, spill and overfill operation and maintenance testing and inspections in subpart C of this part are not required.
              (b) When an UST system is temporarily closed for 3 months or more, owners and operators must also comply with the following requirements:
              (1) Leave vent lines open and functioning; and
              (2) Cap and secure all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment.

              (c) When an UST system is temporarily closed for more than 12 months, owners and operators must permanently close the UST system if it does not meet either performance standards in § 280.20 for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements in § 280.21, except that the spill and overfill equipment requirements do not have to be met. Owners and operators must permanently close the substandard UST systems at the end of this 12-month period in accordance with §§ 280.71 through 280.74, unless the implementing agency provides an extension of the 12-month temporary closure period. Owners and operators must complete a site assessment in accordance with § 280.72 before such an extension can be applied for.
            
            
              § 280.71
              Permanent closure and changes-in-service.

              (a) At least 30 days before beginning either permanent closure or a change-in-service under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or within another reasonable time period determined by the implementing agency, owners and operators must notify the implementing agency of their intent to permanently close or make the change-in-service, unless such action is in response to corrective action. The required assessment of the excavation zone under § 280.72 must be performed after notifying the implementing agency but before completion of the permanent closure or a change-in-service.
              (b) To permanently close a tank, owners and operators must empty and clean it by removing all liquids and accumulated sludges. All tanks taken out of service permanently must: be removed from the ground, filled with an inert solid material, or closed in place in a manner approved by the implementing agency.

              (c) Continued use of an UST system to store a non-regulated substance is considered a change-in-service. Before a change-in-service, owners and operators must empty and clean the tank by removing all liquid and accumulated sludge and conduct a site assessment in accordance with § 280.72.
              
              
                Note to § 280.71.

              § 280.72
              Assessing the site at closure or change-in-service.
              (a) Before permanent closure or a change-in-service is completed, owners and operators must measure for the presence of a release where contamination is most likely to be present at the UST site. In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, owners and operators must consider the method of closure, the nature of the stored substance, the type of backfill, the depth to groundwater, and other factors appropriate for identifying the presence of a release. The requirements of this section are satisfied if one of the external release detection methods allowed in § 280.43(e) and (f) is operating in accordance with the requirements in § 280.43 at the time of closure, and indicates no release has occurred.
              (b) If contaminated soils, contaminated groundwater, or free product as a liquid or vapor is discovered under paragraph (a) of this section, or by any other manner, owners and operators must begin corrective action in accordance with subpart F of this part.
            
            
              § 280.73
              Applicability to previously closed UST systems.
              When directed by the implementing agency, the owner and operator of an UST system permanently closed before December 22, 1988 must assess the excavation zone and close the UST system in accordance with this subpart if releases from the UST may, in the judgment of the implementing agency, pose a current or potential threat to human health and the environment.
            
            
              
              § 280.74
              Closure records.
              Owners and operators must maintain records in accordance with § 280.34 that are capable of demonstrating compliance with closure requirements under this subpart. The results of the excavation zone assessment required in § 280.72 must be maintained for at least three years after completion of permanent closure or change-in-service in one of the following ways:
              (a) By the owners and operators who took the UST system out of service;
              (b) By the current owners and operators of the UST system site; or
              (c) By mailing these records to the implementing agency if they cannot be maintained at the closed facility.
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Financial Responsibility
            
              § 280.90
              Applicability.
              (a) This subpart applies to owners and operators of all petroleum underground storage tank (UST) systems except as otherwise provided in this section.
              (b) Owners and operators of petroleum UST systems are subject to these requirements in accordance with § 280.91.
              (c) State and Federal government entities whose debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of a state or the United States are exempt from the requirements of this subpart.
              (d) The requirements of this subpart do not apply to owners and operators of any UST system described in § 280.10(b), (c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4).
              (e) If the owner and operator of a petroleum underground storage tank are separate persons, only one person is required to demonstrate financial responsibility; however, both parties are liable in event of noncompliance.
            
            
              § 280.91
              Compliance dates.

              When used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings given below:
              
                Accidental release means any sudden or nonsudden release of petroleum arising from operating an underground storage tank that results in a need for corrective action and/or compensation for bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the tank owner or operator.
              
                Bodily injury shall have the meaning given to this term by applicable state law; however, this term shall not include those liabilities which, consistent with standard insurance industry practices, are excluded from coverage in liability insurance policies for bodily injury.
              
                Chief Financial Officer, in the case of local government owners and operators, means the individual with the overall authority and responsibility for the collection, disbursement, and use of funds by the local government.
              
                Controlling interest means direct ownership of at least 50 percent of the voting stock of another entity.
              
                Director of the Implementing Agency means the EPA Regional Administrator, or, in the case of a state with a program approved under section 9004, the Director of the designated state or local agency responsible for carrying out an approved UST program.
              
                Financial reporting year means the latest consecutive twelve-month period for which any of the following reports used to support a financial test is prepared:
              (1) A 10-K report submitted to the SEC;

                Occurrence means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in a release from an underground storage tank.
              Note to the definition of Occurrence. This definition is intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and is not intended either to limit the meaning of “occurrence” in a way that conflicts with standard insurance usage or to prevent the use of other standard insurance terms in place of “occurrence.”
              
                Owner or operator, when the owner or operator are separate parties, refers to the party that is obtaining or has obtained financial assurances.
              
                Petroleum marketing facilities include all facilities at which petroleum is produced or refined and all facilities from which petroleum is sold or transferred to other petroleum marketers or to the public.
              
                Property damage shall have the meaning given this term by applicable state law. This term shall not include those liabilities which, consistent with standard insurance industry practices, are excluded from coverage in liability insurance policies for property damage. However, such exclusions for property damage shall not include corrective action associated with releases from tanks which are covered by the policy.
              
                Provider of financial assurance means an entity that provides financial assurance to an owner or operator of an underground storage tank through one of the mechanisms listed in §§ 280.95 through 280.107, including a guarantor, insurer, risk retention group, surety, issuer of a letter of credit, issuer of a state-required mechanism, or a state.
              
                Substantial business relationship means the extent of a business relationship necessary under applicable state law to make a guarantee contract issued incident to that relationship valid and enforceable. A guarantee contract is issued “incident to that relationship” if it arises from and depends on existing economic transactions between the guarantor and the owner or operator.
              
                Substantial governmental relationship means the extent of a governmental relationship necessary under applicable state law to make an added guarantee contract issued incident to that relationship valid and enforceable. A guarantee contract is issued “incident to that relationship” if it arises from a clear commonality of interest in the event of an UST release such as coterminous boundaries, overlapping constituencies, common groundwater aquifer, or other relationship other than monetary compensation that provides a motivation for the guarantor to provide a guarantee.
              
                Tangible net worth means the tangible assets that remain after deducting liabilities; such assets do not include intangibles such as goodwill and rights to patents or royalties. For purposes of this definition, “assets” means all existing and all probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions.
              
                Termination under § 280.97(b)(1) and (2) means only those changes that could result in a gap in coverage as where the insured has not obtained substitute coverage or has obtained substitute coverage with a different retroactive date than the retroactive date of the original policy.
            
            
              
              § 280.93
              Amount and scope of required financial responsibility.
              (a) Owners or operators of petroleum underground storage tanks must demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks in at least the following per-occurrence amounts:
              (1) For owners or operators of petroleum underground storage tanks that are located at petroleum marketing facilities, or that handle an average of more than 10,000 gallons of petroleum per month based on annual throughput for the previous calendar year; $1 million.
              (2) For all other owners or operators of petroleum underground storage tanks; $500,000.
              (b) Owners or operators of petroleum underground storage tanks must demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks in at least the following annual aggregate amounts:
              (1) For owners or operators of 1 to 100 petroleum underground storage tanks, $1 million; and
              (2) For owners or operators of 101 or more petroleum underground storage tanks, $2 million.
              (c) For the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, only, “a petroleum underground storage tank” means a single containment unit and does not mean combinations of single containment units.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the owner or operator uses separate mechanisms or separate combinations of mechanisms to demonstrate financial responsibility for:
              (1) Taking corrective action;
              (2) Compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by sudden accidental releases; or
              (3) Compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by nonsudden accidental releases, the amount of assurance provided by each mechanism or combination of mechanisms must be in the full amount specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
              (e) If an owner or operator uses separate mechanisms or separate combinations of mechanisms to demonstrate financial responsibility for different petroleum underground storage tanks, the annual aggregate required shall be based on the number of tanks covered by each such separate mechanism or combination of mechanisms.
              (f) Owners or operators shall review the amount of aggregate assurance provided whenever additional petroleum underground storage tanks are acquired or installed. If the number of petroleum underground storage tanks for which assurance must be provided exceeds 100, the owner or operator shall demonstrate financial responsibility in the amount of at least $2 million of annual aggregate assurance by the anniversary of the date on which the mechanism demonstrating financial responsibility became effective. If assurance is being demonstrated by a combination of mechanisms, the owner or operator shall demonstrate financial responsibility in the amount of at least $2 million of annual aggregate assurance by the first-occurring effective date anniversary of any one of the mechanisms combined (other than a financial test or guarantee) to provide assurance.
              (g) The amounts of assurance required under this section exclude legal defense costs.
              (h) The required per-occurrence and annual aggregate coverage amounts do not in any way limit the liability of the owner or operator.
            
            
              § 280.94
              Allowable mechanisms and combinations of mechanisms.
              (a) Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:
              (1) An owner or operator, including a local government owner or operator, may use any one or combination of the mechanisms listed in §§ 280.95 through 280.103 to demonstrate financial responsibility under this subpart for one or more underground storage tanks; and

              (2) A local government owner or operator may use any one or combination of the mechanisms listed in §§ 280.104 through 280.107 to demonstrate financial responsibility under this subpart for one or more underground storage tanks.
              (b) An owner or operator may use a guarantee under § 280.96 or surety bond under § 280.98 to establish financial responsibility only if the Attorney(s) General of the state(s) in which the underground storage tanks are located has (have) submitted a written statement to the implementing agency that a guarantee or surety bond executed as described in this section is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that state.
              (c) An owner or operator may use self-insurance in combination with a guarantee only if, for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the financial test under this rule, the financial statements of the owner or operator are not consolidated with the financial statements of the guarantor.
            
            
              § 280.95

              (ii) The sum of the corrective action cost estimates, the current closure and post-closure care cost estimates, and amount of liability coverage for which a financial test is used to demonstrate financial responsibility to EPA under 40 CFR 264.101, 264.143, 264.145, 265.143, 265.145, 264.147, and 265.147 or to a state implementing agency under a state program authorized by EPA under 40 CFR part 271; and
              (iii) The sum of current plugging and abandonment cost estimates for which a financial test is used to demonstrate financial responsibility to EPA under 40 CFR 144.63 or to a state implementing agency under a state program authorized by EPA under 40 CFR part 145.
              (2) The owner or operator, and/or guarantor, must have a tangible net worth of at least $10 million.

              (5) The firm's year-end financial statements, if independently audited, cannot include an adverse auditor's opinion, a disclaimer of opinion, or a “going concern” qualification.
              (c)(1) The owner or operator, and/or guarantor must meet the financial test requirements of 40 CFR 264.147(f)(1), substituting the appropriate amounts specified in § 280.93(b)(1) and (2) for the “amount of liability coverage” each time specified in that section.
              (2) The fiscal year-end financial statements of the owner or operator, and/or guarantor, must be examined by an independent certified public accountant and be accompanied by the accountant's report of the examination.
              (3) The firm's year-end financial statements cannot include an adverse auditor's opinion, a disclaimer of opinion, or a “going concern” qualification.

              (i) He has compared the data that the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having been derived from the latest year-end financial statements of the owner or operator, and/or guarantor, with the amounts in such financial statements; and
              (ii) In connection with that comparison, no matters came to his attention which caused him to believe that the specified data should be adjusted.
              (d) To demonstrate that it meets the financial test under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the chief financial officer of the owner or operator, or guarantor, must sign, within 120 days of the close of each financial reporting year, as defined by the twelve-month period for which financial statements used to support the financial test are prepared, a letter worded exactly as follows, except that the instructions in brackets are to be replaced by the relevant information and the brackets deleted:

              (e) If an owner or operator using the test to provide financial assurance finds that he or she no longer meets the requirements of the financial test based on the year-end financial statements, the owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage within 150 days of the end of the year for which financial statements have been prepared.
              (f) The Director of the implementing agency may require reports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator, and/or guarantor. If the Director finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator, and/or guarantor, no longer meets the financial test requirements of § 280.95(b) or (c) and (d), the owner or operator must obtain alternate coverage within 30 days after notification of such a finding.
              (g) If the owner or operator fails to obtain alternate assurance within 150 days of finding that he or she no longer meets the requirements of the financial test based on the year-end financial statements, or within 30 days of notification by the Director of the implementing agency that he or she no longer meets the requirements of the financial test, the owner or operator must notify the Director of such failure within 10 days.
            
            
              § 280.96
              Guarantee.
              (a) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by obtaining a guarantee that conforms to the requirements of this section. The guarantor must be:
              (1) A firm that:

              (i) Possesses a controlling interest in the owner or operator;
              
              (ii) Possesses a controlling interest in a firm described under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; or,
              (iii) Is controlled through stock ownership by a common parent firm that possesses a controlling interest in the owner or operator; or,
              (2) A firm engaged in a substantial business relationship with the owner or operator and issuing the guarantee as an act incident to that business relationship.
              (b) Within 120 days of the close of each financial reporting year the guarantor must demonstrate that it meets the financial test criteria of § 280.95 based on year-end financial statements for the latest completed financial reporting year by completing the letter from the chief financial officer described in § 280.95(d) and must deliver the letter to the owner or operator. If the guarantor fails to meet the requirements of the financial test at the end of any financial reporting year, within 120 days of the end of that financial reporting year the guarantor shall send by certified mail, before cancellation or nonrenewal of the guarantee, notice to the owner or operator. If the Director of the implementing agency notifies the guarantor that he no longer meets the requirements of the financial test of § 280.95(b) or (c) and (d), the guarantor must notify the owner or operator within 10 days of receiving such notification from the Director. In both cases, the guarantee will terminate no less than 120 days after the date the owner or operator receives the notification, as evidenced by the return receipt. The owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage as specified in § 280.114(e).
              (c) The guarantee must be worded as follows, except that instructions in brackets are to be replaced with the relevant information and the brackets deleted:
                Guarantee
              Guarantee made this [date] by [name of guaranteeing entity], a business entity organized under the laws of the state of [name of state], herein referred to as guarantor, to [the state implementing agency] and to any and all third parties, and obligees, on behalf of [owner or operator] of [business address].
                Recitals.
              (1) Guarantor meets or exceeds the financial test criteria of 40 CFR 280.95(b) or (c) and (d) and agrees to comply with the requirements for guarantors as specified in 40 CFR 280.96(b).
              (2) [Owner or operator] owns or operates the following underground storage tank(s) covered by this guarantee: [List the number of tanks at each facility and the name(s) and address(es) of the facility(ies) where the tanks are located. If more than one instrument is used to assure different tanks at any one facility, for each tank covered by this instrument, list the tank identification number provided in the notification submitted pursuant to 40 CFR 280.22 or the corresponding state requirement, and the name and address of the facility.] This guarantee satisfies 40 CFR part 280, subpart H requirements for assuring funding for [insert: “taking corrective action” and/or “compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by” either “sudden accidental releases” or “nonsudden accidental releases” or “accidental releases”; if coverage is different for different tanks or locations, indicate the type of coverage applicable to each tank or location] arising from operating the above-identified underground storage tank(s) in the amount of [insert dollar amount] per occurrence and [insert dollar amount] annual aggregate.
              (3) [Insert appropriate phrase: “On behalf of our subsidiary” (if guarantor is corporate parent of the owner or operator); “On behalf of our affiliate” (if guarantor is a related firm of the owner or operator); or “Incident to our business relationship with” (if guarantor is providing the guarantee as an incident to a substantial business relationship with owner or operator)] [owner or operator], guarantor guarantees to [implementing agency] and to any and all third parties that:

              In the event that [owner or operator] fails to provide alternative coverage within 60 days after receipt of a notice of cancellation of this guarantee and the [Director of the implementing agency] has determined or suspects that a release has occurred at an underground storage tank covered by this guarantee, the guarantor, upon instructions from the [Director], shall fund a standby trust fund in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112, in an amount not to exceed the coverage limits specified above.
              In the event that the [Director] determines that [owner or operator] has failed to perform corrective action for releases arising out of the operation of the above-identified tank(s) in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart F, the guarantor upon written instructions from the [Director] shall fund a standby trust in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112, in an amount not to exceed the coverage limits specified above.
              If [owner or operator] fails to satisfy a judgment or award based on a determination of liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties caused by [“sudden” and/or “nonsudden”] accidental releases arising from the operation of the above-identified tank(s), or fails to pay an amount agreed to in settlement of a claim arising from or alleged to arise from such injury or damage, the guarantor, upon written instructions from the [Director], shall fund a standby trust in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112 to satisfy such judgment(s), award(s), or settlement agreement(s) up to the limits of coverage specified above.
              (4) Guarantor agrees that if, at the end of any fiscal year before cancellation of this guarantee, the guarantor fails to meet the financial test criteria of 40 CFR 280.95(b) or (c) and (d), guarantor shall send within 120 days of such failure, by certified mail, notice to [owner or operator]. The guarantee will terminate 120 days from the date of receipt of the notice by [owner or operator], as evidenced by the return receipt.
              (5) Guarantor agrees to notify [owner or operator] by certified mail of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code naming guarantor as debtor, within 10 days after commencement of the proceeding.
              (6) Guarantor agrees to remain bound under this guarantee notwithstanding any modification or alteration of any obligation of [owner or operator] pursuant to 40 CFR part 280.
              (7) Guarantor agrees to remain bound under this guarantee for so long as [owner or operator] must comply with the applicable financial responsibility requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart H for the above-identified tank(s), except that guarantor may cancel this guarantee by sending notice by certified mail to [owner or operator], such cancellation to become effective no earlier than 120 days after receipt of such notice by [owner or operator], as evidenced by the return receipt.
              (8) The guarantor's obligation does not apply to any of the following:
              (a) Any obligation of [insert owner or operator] under a workers' compensation, disability benefits, or unemployment compensation law or other similar law;
              (b) Bodily injury to an employee of [insert owner or operator] arising from, and in the course of, employment by [insert owner or operator];
              (c) Bodily injury or property damage arising from the ownership, maintenance, use, or entrustment to others of any aircraft, motor vehicle, or watercraft;
              (d) Property damage to any property owned, rented, loaded to, in the care, custody, or control of, or occupied by [insert owner or operator] that is not the direct result of a release from a petroleum underground storage tank;
              (e) Bodily damage or property damage for which [insert owner or operator] is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement other than a contract or agreement entered into to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 280.93.
              (9) Guarantor expressly waives notice of acceptance of this guarantee by [the implementing agency], by any or all third parties, or by [owner or operator].

              I hereby certify that the wording of this guarantee is identical to the wording specified in 40 CFR 280.96(c) as such regulations were constituted on the effective date shown immediately below.

              Signature of witness or notary:
              
              (d) An owner or operator who uses a guarantee to satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 must establish a standby trust fund when the guarantee is obtained. Under the terms of the guarantee, all amounts paid by the guarantor under the guarantee will be deposited directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Director of the implementing agency under § 280.112. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in § 280.103.

Claims reported during such extended reporting period are subject to the terms, conditions, limits, including limits of liability, and exclusions of the policy.]

              Know All Persons by These Presents, that we, the Principal and Surety(ies), hereto are firmly bound to [the implementing agency], in the above penal sums for the payment of which we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns jointly and severally; provided that, where the Surety(ies) are corporations acting as co-sureties, we, the Sureties, bind ourselves in such sums jointly and severally only for the purpose of allowing a joint action or actions against any or all of us, and for all other purposes each Surety binds itself, jointly and severally with the Principal, for the payment of such sums only as is set forth opposite the name of such Surety, but if no limit of liability is indicated, the limit of liability shall be the full amount of the penal sums.
              Whereas said Principal is required under Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, to provide financial assurance for [insert: “taking corrective action” and/or “compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by” either “sudden accidental releases” or “nonsudden accidental releases” or “accidental releases”; if coverage is different for different tanks or locations, indicate the type of coverage applicable to each tank or location] arising from operating the underground storage tanks identified above, and
              Whereas said Principal shall establish a standby trust fund as is required when a surety bond is used to provide such financial assurance;

              Now, therefore, the conditions of the obligation are such that if the Principal shall faithfully [“take corrective action, in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart F and the Director of the state implementing agency's instructions for,” and/or “compensate injured third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by” either “sudden accidental releases” or “nonsudden accidental releases” or “accidental releases”] arising from operating the tank(s) identified above, or if the Principal shall provide alternate financial assurance, as specified in 40 CFR part 280, subpart H, within 120 days after the date the notice of cancellation is received by the Principal from the Surety(ies), then this obligation shall be null and void; otherwise it is to remain in full force and effect.
              Such obligation does not apply to any of the following:
              (a) Any obligation of [insert owner or operator] under a workers' compensation, disability benefits, or unemployment compensation law or other similar law;
              (b) Bodily injury to an employee of [insert owner or operator] arising from, and in the course of, employment by [insert owner or operator];
              (c) Bodily injury or property damage arising from the ownership, maintenance, use, or entrustment to others of any aircraft, motor vehicle, or watercraft;
              (d) Property damage to any property owned, rented, loaned to, in the care, custody, or control of, or occupied by [insert owner or operator] that is not the direct result of a release from a petroleum underground storage tank;
              (e) Bodily injury or property damage for which [insert owner or operator] is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement other than a contract or agreement entered into to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 280.93.
              The Surety(ies) shall become liable on this bond obligation only when the Principal has failed to fulfill the conditions described above.
              Upon notification by [the Director of the implementing agency] that the Principal has failed to [“take corrective action, in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart F and the Director's instructions,” and/or “compensate injured third parties”] as guaranteed by this bond, the Surety(ies) shall either perform [“corrective action in accordance with 40 CFR part 280 and the Director's instructions,” and/or “third-party liability compensation”] or place funds in an amount up to the annual aggregate penal sum into the standby trust fund as directed by [the Regional Administrator or the Director] under 40 CFR 280.112.
              Upon notification by [the Director] that the Principal has failed to provide alternate financial assurance within 60 days after the date the notice of cancellation is received by the Principal from the Surety(ies) and that [the Director] has determined or suspects that a release has occurred, the Surety(ies) shall place funds in an amount not exceeding the annual aggregate penal sum into the standby trust fund as directed by [the Director] under 40 CFR 280.112.
              The Surety(ies) hereby waive(s) notification of amendments to applicable laws, statutes, rules, and regulations and agrees that no such amendment shall in any way alleviate its (their) obligation on this bond.
              The liability of the Surety(ies) shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the annual aggregate to the penal sum shown on the face of the bond, but in no event shall the obligation of the Surety(ies) hereunder exceed the amount of said annual aggregate penal sum.
              The Surety(ies) may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the Principal, provided, however, that cancellation shall not occur during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by the Principal, as evidenced by the return receipt.
              The Principal may terminate this bond by sending written notice to the Surety(ies).
              In Witness Thereof, the Principal and Surety(ies) have executed this Bond and have affixed their seals on the date set forth above.

              The persons whose signatures appear below hereby certify that they are authorized to execute this surety bond on behalf of the Principal and Surety(ies) and that the wording of this surety bond is identical to the wording specified in 40 CFR 280.98(b) as such regulations were constituted on the date this bond was executed.

              Use of state-required mechanism.
              (a) For underground storage tanks located in a state that does not have an approved program, and where the state requires owners or operators of underground storage tanks to demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and/or for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage, an owner or operator may use a state-required financial mechanism to meet the requirements of § 280.93 if the Regional Administrator determines that the state mechanism is at least equivalent to the financial mechanisms specified in this subpart.

              (b) The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of a state-required mechanism principally in terms of: certainty of the availability of funds for taking corrective action and/or for compensating third parties; the amount of funds that will be made available; and the types of costs covered. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as is necessary.
              (c) The state, an owner or operator, or any other interested party may submit to the Regional Administrator a written petition requesting that one or more of the state-required mechanisms be considered acceptable for meeting the requirements of § 280.93.

              § 280.101

              (b) The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of a state fund or other state assurance principally in terms of: Certainty of the availability of funds for taking corrective action and/or for compensating third parties; the amount of funds that will be made available; and the types of costs covered. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as is necessary.
              (c) The state must submit to the Regional Administrator a description of the state fund or other state assurance to be supplied as financial assurance, along with a list of the classes of underground storage tanks to which the funds may be applied. The Regional Administrator may require the state to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make a determination regarding the acceptability of the state fund or other state assurance. Pending the determination by the Regional Administrator, the owner or operator of a covered class of USTs will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of § 280.93 for the amounts and types of costs covered by the state fund or other state assurance.
              (d) The Regional Administrator will notify the state of his determination regarding the acceptability of the state's fund or other assurance in lieu of financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. Within 60 days after the Regional Administrator notifies a state that a state fund or other state assurance is acceptable, the state must provide to each owner or operator for which it is assuming financial responsibility a letter or certificate describing the nature of the state's assumption of responsibility. The letter or certificate from the state must include, or have attached to it, the following information: the facility's name and address and the amount of funds for corrective action and/or for compensating third parties that is assured by the state. The owner or operator must maintain this letter or certificate on file as proof of financial responsibility in accordance with § 280.111(b)(8).

              (c) The trust fund, when established, must be funded for the full required amount of coverage, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s) that provide the remaining required coverage.
              (d) If the value of the trust fund is greater than the required amount of coverage, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Director of the implementing agency for release of the excess.
              (e) If other financial assurance as specified in this subpart is substituted for all or part of the trust fund, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Director of the implementing agency for release of the excess.
              (f) Within 60 days after receiving a request from the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, the Director of the implementing agency will instruct the trustee to release to the owner or operator such funds as the Director specifies in writing.

The attached Schedule A lists the number of tanks at each facility and the name(s) and address(es) of the facility(ies) where the tanks are located that are covered by the [insert “standby” where trust agreement is standby trust agreement] trust agreement.
              [Whereas, the Grantor has elected to establish [insert either “a guarantee,” “surety bond,” or “letter of credit”] to provide all or part of such financial assurance for the underground storage tanks identified herein and is required to establish a standby trust fund able to accept payments from the instrument (This paragraph is only applicable to the standby trust agreement.)];
              Whereas, the Grantor, acting through its duly authorized officers, has selected the Trustee to be the trustee under this agreement, and the Trustee is willing to act as trustee;
              Now, therefore, the Grantor and the Trustee agree as follows:
              Section 1. Definitions

              Section 3. Establishment of Fund
              The Grantor and the Trustee hereby establish a trust fund, the “Fund,” for the benefit of [implementing agency]. The Grantor and the Trustee intend that no third party have access to the Fund except as herein provided. [The Fund is established initially as a standby to receive payments and shall not consist of any property.] Payments made by the provider of financial assurance pursuant to [the Director of the implementing agency's] instruction are transferred to the Trustee and are referred to as the Fund, together with all earnings and profits thereon, less any payments or distributions made by the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement. The Fund shall be held by the Trustee, IN TRUST, as hereinafter provided. The Trustee shall not be responsible nor shall it undertake any responsibility for the amount or adequacy of, nor any duty to collect from the Grantor as provider of financial assurance, any payments necessary to discharge any liability of the Grantor established by [the state implementing agency]
              Section 4. Payment for [“Corrective Action” and/or “Third-Party Liability Claims”]
              The Trustee shall make payments from the Fund as [the Director of the implementing agency] shall direct, in writing, to provide for the payment of the costs of [insert: “taking corrective action” and/or “compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by” either “sudden accidental releases” or “nonsudden accidental Releases” or “accidental releases”] arising from operating the tanks covered by the financial assurance mechanism identified in this Agreement.

              § 280.104
              Local government bond rating test.

              (a) A general purpose local government owner or operator and/or local government serving as a guarantor may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by having a currently outstanding issue or issues of general obligation bonds of $1 million or more, excluding refunded obligations, with a Moody's rating of Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa, or a Standard & Poor's rating of AAA, AA, A, or BBB. Where a local government has multiple outstanding issues, or where a local government's bonds are rated by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's, the lowest rating must be used to determine eligibility. Bonds that are backed by credit enhancement other than municipal bond insurance may not be considered in determining the amount of applicable bonds outstanding.
              (b) A local government owner or operator or local government serving as a guarantor that is not a general-purpose local government and does not have the legal authority to issue general obligation bonds may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by having a currently outstanding issue or issues of revenue bonds of $1 million or more, excluding refunded issues, and by also having a Moody's rating of Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa, or a Standard & Poor's rating of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as the lowest rating for any rated revenue bond issued by the local government. Where bonds are rated by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the lower rating for each bond must be used to determine eligibility. Bonds that are backed by credit enhancement may not be considered in determining the amount of applicable bonds outstanding.
              (c) The local government owner or operator and/or guarantor must maintain a copy of its bond rating published within the last 12 months by Moody's or Standard & Poor's.
              (d) To demonstrate that it meets the local government bond rating test, the chief financial officer of a general purpose local government owner or operator and/or guarantor must sign a letter worded exactly as follows, except that the instructions in brackets are to be replaced by the relevant information and the brackets deleted:
              Letter from Chief Financial Officer

              Underground storage tanks at the following facilities are assured by this bond rating test: [List for each facility: the name and address of the facility where tanks are assured by the bond rating test].
              The details of the issue date, maturity, outstanding amount, bond rating, and bond rating agency of all outstanding bond issues that are being used by [name of local government owner or operator, or guarantor] to demonstrate financial responsibility are as follows:

              The total outstanding obligation of [insert amount], excluding refunded bond issues, exceeds the minimum amount of $1 million. All outstanding general obligation bonds issued by this government that have been rated by Moody's or Standard & Poor's are rated as at least investment grade (Moody's Baa or Standard & Poor's BBB) based on the most recent ratings published within the last 12 months. Neither rating service has provided notification within the last 12 months of downgrading of bond ratings below investment grade or of withdrawal of bond rating other than for repayment of outstanding bond issues.

If the Director finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the local government owner or operator, and/or guarantor, no longer meets the local government bond rating test requirements of § 280.104, the local government owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage within 30 days after notification of such a finding.

              (d) If a local government owner or operator using the test to provide financial assurance finds that it no longer meets the requirements of the financial test based on the year-end financial statements, the owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage within 150 days of the end of the year for which financial statements have been prepared.
              (e) The Director of the implementing agency may require reports of financial condition at any time from the local government owner or operator. If the Director finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the local government owner or operator no longer meets the financial test requirements of § 280.105(b) and (c), the owner or operator must obtain alternate coverage within 30 days after notification of such a finding.
              (f) If the local government owner or operator fails to obtain alternate assurance within 150 days of finding that it no longer meets the requirements of the financial test based on the year-end financial statements or within 30 days of notification by the Director of the implementing agency that it no longer meets the requirements of the financial test, the owner or operator must notify the Director of such failure within 10 days.
            
            
              § 280.106
              Local government guarantee.
              (a) A local government owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by obtaining a guarantee that conforms to the requirements of this section. The guarantor must be either the state in which the local government owner or operator is located or a local government having a “substantial governmental relationship” with the owner and operator and issuing the guarantee as an act incident to that relationship. A local government acting as the guarantor must:
              (1) Demonstrate that it meets the bond rating test requirement of § 280.104 and deliver a copy of the chief financial officer's letter as contained in § 280.104(d) and (e) to the local government owner or operator; or
              (2) Demonstrate that it meets the worksheet test requirements of § 280.105 and deliver a copy of the chief financial officer's letter as contained in § 280.105(c) to the local government owner or operator; or
              (3) Demonstrate that it meets the local government fund requirements of § 280.107(a), (b), or (c) and deliver a copy of the chief financial officer's letter as contained in § 280.107 to the local government owner or operator.
              (b) If the local government guarantor is unable to demonstrate financial assurance under any of §§ 280.104, 280.105, or 280.107(a), (b), or (c), at the end of the financial reporting year, the guarantor shall send by certified mail, before cancellation or non-renewal of the guarantee, notice to the owner or operator. The guarantee will terminate no less than 120 days after the date the owner or operator receives the notification, as evidenced by the return receipt. The owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage as specified in § 280.114(e).
              (c) The guarantee agreement must be worded as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, depending on which of the following alternative guarantee arrangements is selected:
              (1) If, in the default or incapacity of the owner or operator, the guarantor guarantees to fund a standby trust as directed by the Director of the implementing agency, the guarantee shall be worded as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) If, in the default or incapacity of the owner or operator, the guarantor guarantees to make payments as directed by the Director of the implementing agency for taking corrective action or compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage, the guarantee shall be worded as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (d) If the guarantor is a state, the local government guarantee with standby trust must be worded exactly as follows, except that instructions in brackets are to be replaced with relevant information and the brackets deleted:

              (4) Guarantor agrees to notify [owner or operator] by certified mail of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code naming guarantor as debtor, within 10 days after commencement of the proceeding.

              (d) Property damage to any property owned, rented, loaned to, in the care, custody, or control of, or occupied by [insert: local government owner or operator] that is not the direct result of a release from a petroleum underground storage tank;
              (e) Bodily damage or property damage for which [insert owner or operator] is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement other than a contract or agreement entered into to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 280.93.
              (8) Guarantor expressly waives notice of acceptance of this guarantee by [the implementing agency], by any or all third parties, or by [local government owner or operator],

              If [owner or operator] fails to satisfy a judgment or award based on a determination of liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties caused by [“sudden” and/or “nonsudden”] accidental releases arising from the operation of the above-identified tank(s), or fails to pay an amount agreed to in settlement of a claim arising from or alleged to arise from such injury or damage, the guarantor, upon written instructions from the [Director], shall make funds available to compensate third parties for bodily injury and property damage in an amount not to exceed the coverage limits specified above.
              (4) Guarantor agrees to notify [owner or operator] by certified mail of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code naming guarantor as debtor, within 10 days after commencement of the proceeding.

If notified of a probable release, the guarantor agrees to remain bound to the terms of this guarantee for all charges arising from the release, up to the coverage limits specified above, notwithstanding the cancellation of the guarantee with respect to future releases.
              (7) The guarantor's obligation does not apply to any of the following:

              § 280.107
              Local government fund.
              A local government owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by establishing a dedicated fund account that conforms to the requirements of this section. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a dedicated fund may not be commingled with other funds or otherwise used in normal operations. A dedicated fund will be considered eligible if it meets one of the following requirements:
              (a) The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or order to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks and is funded for the full amount of coverage required under § 280.93, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage; or
              (b) The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or order as a contingency fund for general emergencies, including taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks, and is funded for five times the full amount of coverage required under § 280.93, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage. If the fund is funded for less than five times the amount of coverage required under § 280.93, the amount of financial responsibility demonstrated by the fund may not exceed one-fifth the amount in the fund; or
              (c) The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance or order to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks. A payment is made to the fund once every year for seven years until the fund is fully-funded. This seven year period is hereafter referred to as the “pay-in-period.” The amount of each payment must be determined by this formula:
              
                ER15JY15.042
              
              Where TF is the total required financial assurance for the owner or operator, CF is the current amount in the fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the pay-in-period; and,

              (1) The local government owner or operator has available bonding authority, approved through voter referendum (if such approval is necessary prior to the issuance of bonds), for an amount equal to the difference between the required amount of coverage and the amount held in the dedicated fund. This bonding authority shall be available for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks; or
              
              (2) The local government owner or operator has a letter signed by the appropriate state attorney general stating that the use of the bonding authority will not increase the local government's debt beyond the legal debt ceilings established by the relevant state laws. The letter must also state that prior voter approval is not necessary before use of the bonding authority.

              (d) To demonstrate that it meets the requirements of the local government fund, the chief financial officer of the local government owner or operator and/or guarantor must sign a letter worded exactly as follows, except that the instructions in brackets are to be replaced by the relevant information and the brackets deleted:
              
                Letter from Chief Financial Officer
              I am the chief financial officer of [insert: name and address of local government owner or operator, or guarantor]. This letter is in support of the use of the local government fund mechanism to demonstrate financial responsibility for [insert: “taking corrective action” and/or “compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage”] caused by [insert: “sudden accidental releases” or “nonsudden accidental releases” or “accidental releases”] in the amount of at least [insert: dollar amount] per occurrence and [insert: dollar amount] annual aggregate arising from operating (an) underground storage tank(s).
              Underground storage tanks at the following facilities are assured by this local government fund mechanism: [List for each facility: The name and address of the facility where tanks are assured by the local government fund].
              [Insert: “The local government fund is funded for the full amount of coverage required under § 280.93, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage.” or “The local government fund is funded for five times the full amount of coverage required under § 280.93, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanisms(s) that provide the remaining coverage,” or “A payment is made to the fund once every year for seven years until the fund is fully-funded and [name of local government owner or operator] has available bonding authority, approved through voter referendum, of an amount equal to the difference between the required amount of coverage and the amount held in the dedicated fund” or “A payment is made to the fund once every year for seven years until the fund is fully-funded and I have attached a letter signed by the State Attorney General stating that (1) the use of the bonding authority will not increase the local government's debt beyond the legal debt ceilings established by the relevant state laws and (2) that prior voter approval is not necessary before use of the bonding authority”].

              Amount in Fund (market value of fund at close of last fiscal year):
              [If fund balance is incrementally funded as specified in § 280.107(c), insert:
              Amount added to fund in the most recently completed fiscal year:
              Number of years remaining in the pay-in-period: ____]
              
              A copy of the state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance or order dedicating the fund is attached.

              I hereby certify that the wording of this letter is identical to the wording specified in 40 CFR 280.107(d) as such regulations were constituted on the date shown immediately below.

              § 280.112
              Drawing on financial assurance mechanisms.
              (a) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the Director of the implementing agency shall require the guarantor, surety, or institution issuing a letter of credit to place the amount of funds stipulated by the Director, up to the limit of funds provided by the financial assurance mechanism, into the standby trust if:
              (1)(i) The owner or operator fails to establish alternate financial assurance within 60 days after receiving notice of cancellation of the guarantee, surety bond, letter of credit, or, as applicable, other financial assurance mechanism; and
              (ii) The Director determines or suspects that a release from an underground storage tank covered by the mechanism has occurred and so notifies the owner or operator or the owner or operator has notified the Director pursuant to subparts E or F of a release from an underground storage tank covered by the mechanism; or
              (2) The conditions of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are satisfied.
              (b) The Director of the implementing agency may draw on a standby trust fund when:
              (1) The Director makes a final determination that a release has occurred and immediate or long-term corrective action for the release is needed, and the owner or operator, after appropriate notice and opportunity to comply, has not conducted corrective action as required under subpart F of this part; or
              (2) The Director has received either:
              (i) Certification from the owner or operator and the third-party liability claimant(s) and from attorneys representing the owner or operator and the third-party liability claimant(s) that a third-party liability claim should be paid. The certification must be worded as follows, except that instructions in brackets are to be replaced with the relevant information and the brackets deleted:
                Certification of Valid Claim

              The undersigned, as principals and as legal representatives of [insert: owner or operator] and [insert: name and address of third-party claimant], hereby certify that the claim of bodily injury [and/or] property damage caused by an accidental release arising from operating [owner's or operator's] underground storage tank should be paid in the amount of $[_].

              (ii) A valid final court order establishing a judgment against the owner or operator for bodily injury or property damage caused by an accidental release from an underground storage tank covered by financial assurance under this subpart and the Director determines that the owner or operator has not satisfied the judgment.

              (c) If the Director of the implementing agency determines that the amount of corrective action costs and third-party liability claims eligible for payment under paragraph (b) of this section may exceed the balance of the standby trust fund and the obligation of the provider of financial assurance, the first priority for payment shall be corrective action costs necessary to protect human health and the environment. The Director shall pay third-party liability claims in the order in which the Director receives certifications under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and valid court orders under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (d) A governmental entity acting as guarantor under § 280.106(e), the local government guarantee without standby trust, shall make payments as directed by the Director under the circumstances described in § 280.112(a), (b), and (c).
            
            
              § 280.113
              Release from the requirements.
              An owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial responsibility under this subpart for an underground storage tank after the tank has been permanently closed or undergoes a change-in-service or, if corrective action is required, after corrective action has been completed and the tank has been permanently closed or undergoes a change-in-service as required by subpart G of this part.
            
            
              § 280.114
              Bankruptcy or other incapacity of owner or operator or provider of financial assurance.
              (a) Within 10 days after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming an owner or operator as debtor, the owner or operator must notify the Director of the implementing agency by certified mail of such commencement and submit the appropriate forms listed in § 280.111(b) documenting current financial responsibility.
              (b) Within 10 days after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming a guarantor providing financial assurance as debtor, such guarantor must notify the owner or operator by certified mail of such commencement as required under the terms of the guarantee specified in § 280.96.
              (c) Within 10 days after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming a local government owner or operator as debtor, the local government owner or operator must notify the Director of the implementing agency by certified mail of such commencement and submit the appropriate forms listed in § 280.111(b) documenting current financial responsibility.
              (d) Within 10 days after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming a guarantor providing a local government financial assurance as debtor, such guarantor must notify the local government owner or operator by certified mail of such commencement as required under the terms of the guarantee specified in § 280.106.
              (e) An owner or operator who obtains financial assurance by a mechanism other than the financial test of self-insurance will be deemed to be without the required financial assurance in the event of a bankruptcy or incapacity of its provider of financial assurance, or a suspension or revocation of the authority of the provider of financial assurance to issue a guarantee, insurance policy, risk retention group coverage policy, surety bond, letter of credit, or state-required mechanism. The owner or operator must obtain alternate financial assurance as specified in this subpart within 30 days after receiving notice of such an event. If the owner or operator does not obtain alternate coverage within 30 days after such notification, he must notify the Director of the implementing agency.
              (f) Within 30 days after receipt of notification that a state fund or other state assurance has become incapable of paying for assured corrective action or third-party compensation costs, the owner or operator must obtain alternate financial assurance.
            
            
              § 280.115
              Replenishment of guarantees, letters of credit, or surety bonds.

              (a) If at any time after a standby trust is funded upon the instruction of the Director of the implementing agency with funds drawn from a guarantee, local government guarantee with standby trust, letter of credit, or surety bond, and the amount in the standby trust is reduced below the full amount of coverage required, the owner or operator shall by the anniversary date of the financial mechanism from which the funds were drawn:
              (1) Replenish the value of financial assurance to equal the full amount of coverage required; or
              (2) Acquire another financial assurance mechanism for the amount by which funds in the standby trust have been reduced.
              (b) For purposes of this section, the full amount of coverage required is the amount of coverage to be provided by § 280.93. If a combination of mechanisms was used to provide the assurance funds which were drawn upon, replenishment shall occur by the earliest anniversary date among the mechanisms.

            Subpart I—Lender Liability
            
              § 280.200
              Definitions.
              (a) UST technical standards, as used in this subpart, refers to the UST preventative and operating requirements under subparts B, C, D, G, J, and K of this part and § 280.50.
              (b) Petroleum production, refining, and marketing. (1) Petroleum production means the production of crude oil or other forms of petroleum (as defined in § 280.12) as well as the production of petroleum products from purchased materials.
              (2) Petroleum refining means the cracking, distillation, separation, conversion, upgrading, and finishing of refined petroleum or petroleum products.
              (3) Petroleum marketing means the distribution, transfer, or sale of petroleum or petroleum products for wholesale or retail purposes.
              (c) Indicia of ownership means evidence of a secured interest, evidence of an interest in a security interest, or evidence of an interest in real or personal property securing a loan or other obligation, including any legal or equitable title or deed to real or personal property acquired through or incident to foreclosure. Evidence of such interests include, but are not limited to, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, surety bonds and guarantees of obligations, title held pursuant to a lease financing transaction in which the lessor does not select initially the leased property (hereinafter “lease financing transaction”), and legal or equitable title obtained pursuant to foreclosure. Evidence of such interests also includes assignments, pledges, or other rights to or other forms of encumbrance against property that are held primarily to protect a security interest. A person is not required to hold title or a security interest in order to maintain indicia of ownership.
              (d) A holder is a person who, upon the effective date of this regulation or in the future, maintains indicia of ownership (as defined in § 280.200(c)) primarily to protect a security interest (as defined in § 280.200(f)(1)) in a petroleum UST or UST system or facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located. A holder includes the initial holder (such as a loan originator); any subsequent holder (such as a successor-in-interest or subsequent purchaser of the security interest on the secondary market); a guarantor of an obligation, surety, or any other person who holds ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest; or a receiver or other person who acts on behalf or for the benefit of a holder.
              (e) A borrower, debtor, or obligor is a person whose UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located is encumbered by a security interest. These terms may be used interchangeably.
              (f) Primarily to protect a security interest means that the holder's indicia of ownership are held primarily for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation.
              (1) Security interest means an interest in a petroleum UST or UST system or in the facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located, created or established for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation. Security interests include but are not limited to mortgages, deeds of trusts, liens, and title pursuant to lease financing transactions. Security interests may also arise from transactions such as sale and leasebacks, conditional sales, installment sales, trust receipt transactions, certain assignments, factoring agreements, accounts receivable financing arrangements, and consignments, if the transaction creates or establishes an interest in an UST or UST system or in the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation.
              (2) Primarily to protect a security interest, as used in this subpart, does not include indicia of ownership held primarily for investment purposes, nor ownership indicia held primarily for purposes other than as protection for a security interest. A holder may have other, secondary reasons for maintaining indicia of ownership, but the primary reason why any ownership indicia are held must be as protection for a security interest.
              (g) Operation means, for purposes of this subpart, the use, storage, filling, or dispensing of petroleum contained in an UST or UST system.
            
            
              § 280.210
              Participation in management.
              The term “participating in the management of an UST or UST system” means that, subsequent to the effective date of this subpart, December 6, 1995, the holder is engaging in decisionmaking control of, or activities related to, operation of the UST or UST system, as defined herein.
              (a) Actions that are participation in management. (1) Participation in the management of an UST or UST system means, for purposes of this subpart, actual participation by the holder in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the operation of an UST or UST system. Participation in management does not include the mere capacity or ability to influence or the unexercised right to control UST or UST system operations. A holder is participating in the management of the UST or UST system only if the holder either:
              (i) Exercises decisionmaking control over the operational (as opposed to financial or administrative) aspects of the UST or UST system, such that the holder has undertaken responsibility for all or substantially all of the management of the UST or UST system; or
              (ii) Exercises control at a level comparable to that of a manager of the borrower's enterprise, such that the holder has assumed or manifested responsibility for the overall management of the enterprise encompassing the day-to-day decisionmaking of the enterprise with respect to all, or substantially all, of the operational (as opposed to financial or administrative) aspects of the enterprise.
              (2) Operational aspects of the enterprise relate to the use, storage, filling, or dispensing of petroleum contained in an UST or UST system, and include functions such as that of a facility or plant manager, operations manager, chief operating officer, or chief executive officer. Financial or administrative aspects include functions such as that of a credit manager, accounts payable/receivable manager, personnel manager, controller, chief financial officer, or similar functions. Operational aspects of the enterprise do not include the financial or administrative aspects of the enterprise, or actions associated with environmental compliance, or actions undertaken voluntarily to protect the environment in accordance with applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281.
              (b) Actions that are not participation in management pre-foreclosure. (1) Actions at the inception of the loan or other transaction. No act or omission prior to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest constitutes evidence of participation in management within the meaning of this subpart. A prospective holder who undertakes or requires an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit) of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located (in which indicia of ownership are to be held), or requires a prospective borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system or to comply or come into compliance (whether prior or subsequent to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest) with any applicable law or regulation, is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located.
              (2) Loan policing and work out. Actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest do not constitute participation in management for purposes of this subpart. The authority for the holder to take such actions may, but need not, be contained in contractual or other documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental, and other warranties, covenants, conditions, representations or promises from the borrower. Loan policing and work out activities cover and include all such activities up to foreclosure, exclusive of any activities that constitute participation in management.
              (i) Policing the security interest or loan. (A) A holder who engages in policing activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not together with other actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a). Such policing actions include, but are not limited to, requiring the borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system during the term of the security interest; requiring the borrower to comply or come into compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental and other laws, rules, and regulations during the term of the security interest; securing or exercising authority to monitor or inspect the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located (including on-site inspections) in which indicia of ownership are maintained, or the borrower's business or financial condition during the term of the security interest; or taking other actions to adequately police the loan or security interest (such as requiring a borrower to comply with any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower).
              (B) Policing activities also include undertaking by the holder of UST environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions taken in compliance with this part, provided that the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or daily operation of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a) and § 280.230. Such allowable actions include, but are not limited to, release detection and release reporting, release response and corrective action, temporary or permanent closure of an UST or UST system, UST upgrading or replacement, and maintenance of corrosion protection. A holder who undertakes these actions must do so in compliance with the applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281. A holder may directly oversee these environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions, and directly hire contractors to perform the work, and is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system.
              (ii) Loan work out. A holder who engages in work out activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not together with other actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a). For purposes of this rule, “work out” refers to those actions by which a holder, at any time prior to foreclosure, seeks to prevent, cure, or mitigate a default by the borrower or obligor; or to preserve, or prevent the diminution of, the value of the security. Work out activities include, but are not limited to, restructuring or renegotiating the terms of the security interest; requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising forbearance; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an assignment of accounts or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow agreement pertaining to amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling, or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower.
              (c) Foreclosure on an UST or UST system or facility or property on which an UST or UST system is located, and participation in management activities post-foreclosure.
              (1) Foreclosure. (i) Indicia of ownership that are held primarily to protect a security interest include legal or equitable title or deed to real or personal property acquired through or incident to foreclosure. For purposes of this subpart, the term “foreclosure” means that legal, marketable or equitable title or deed has been issued, approved, and recorded, and that the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility, and property on which the UST or UST system is located, provided that the holder acted diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to gain access to the UST, UST system, UST facility, and property on which the UST or UST system is located. The indicia of ownership held after foreclosure continue to be maintained primarily as protection for a security interest provided that the holder undertakes to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or otherwise divest itself of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, in a reasonably expeditious manner, using whatever commercially reasonable means are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, and provided that the holder does not participate in management (as defined in § 280.210(a)) prior to or after foreclosure.

              (ii) For purposes of establishing that a holder is seeking to sell, re-lease pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or divest in a reasonably expeditious manner an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, the holder may use whatever commercially reasonable means as are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or may employ the means specified in § 280.210(c)(2). A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon a written bona fide, firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, as provided in § 280.210(c)(2), is not considered to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest.
              (2) Holding foreclosed property for disposition and liquidation. A holder, who does not participate in management prior to or after foreclosure, may sell, re-lease, pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, liquidate, wind up operations, and take measures, prior to sale or other disposition, to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. A holder may also arrange for an existing or new operator to continue or initiate operation of the UST or UST system. The holder may conduct these activities without voiding the security interest exemption, subject to the requirements of this subpart.

              (i) A holder establishes that the ownership indicia maintained after foreclosure continue to be held primarily to protect a security interest by, within 12 months following foreclosure, listing the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or by advertising the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, as being for sale or disposition on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil procedure) covering the location of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date that the marketable title or deed has been issued, approved and recorded, and the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later, provided that the holder acted diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to obtain access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title or deed or to gain access to the UST or UST system, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date on which the holder first acquires either title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system, or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later.
              (ii) A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, establishes by such outbidding, rejection, or failure to act, that the ownership indicia in the secured UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located are not held primarily to protect the security interest, unless the holder is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make a higher bid, to obtain a higher offer, or to seek or obtain an offer in a different manner.
              (A) Fair consideration, in the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a senior security interest in the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, is the value of the security interest as defined in this section. The value of the security interest includes all debt and costs incurred by the security interest holder, and is calculated as an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of the outstanding principal (or comparable amount in the case of a lease that constitutes a security interest) owed to the holder immediately preceding the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure, plus any unpaid interest, rent, or penalties (whether arising before or after foreclosure). The value of the security interest also includes all reasonable and necessary costs, fees, or other charges incurred by the holder incident to work out, foreclosure, retention, preserving, protecting, and preparing, prior to sale, the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, re-lease, pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), of an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or other disposition. The value of the security interest also includes environmental investigation costs (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located), and corrective action costs incurred under §§ 280.51 through 280.67 or any other costs incurred as a result of reasonable efforts to comply with any other applicable federal, state or local law or regulation; less any amounts received by the holder in connection with any partial disposition of the property and any amounts paid by the borrower (if not already applied to the borrower's obligations) subsequent to the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure. In the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a junior security interest, fair consideration is the value of all outstanding higher priority security interests plus the value of the security interest held by the junior holder, each calculated as set forth in this paragraph (c).

              (B) Outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration means that the holder outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon within 90 days of receipt, a written, bona fide, firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located received at any time after six months following foreclosure, as defined in § 280.210(c). A “written, bona fide, firm offer” means a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, cash offer solely for the foreclosed UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, including all material terms of the transaction, from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. For purposes of this provision, the six-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date that marketable title or deed has been issued, approved and recorded to the holder, and the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later, provided that the holder was acting diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to obtain access to the UST or UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title or deed or to gain access to the UST or UST system, the six-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date on which the holder first acquires either title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system, or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later.
              (3) Actions that are not participation in management post-foreclosure. A holder is not considered to be participating in the management of an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located when undertaking actions under this part, provided that the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or daily operation of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a) and § 280.230. Such allowable actions include, but are not limited to, release detection and release reporting, release response and corrective action, temporary or permanent closure of an UST or UST system, UST upgrading or replacement, and maintenance of corrosion protection. A holder who undertakes these actions must do so in compliance with the applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281. A holder may directly oversee these environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions, and directly hire contractors to perform the work, and is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system.
            
            
              § 280.220
              Ownership of an underground storage tank or underground storage tank system or facility or property on which an underground storage tank or underground storage tank system is located.
              Ownership of an UST or UST system or facility or property on which an UST or UST system is located. A holder is not an “owner” of a petroleum UST or UST system or facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located for purposes of compliance with the UST technical standards as defined in § 280.200(a), the UST corrective action requirements under §§ 280.51 through 280.67, and the UST financial responsibility requirements under §§ 280.90 through 280.111, provided the person:

            Subpart A—Purpose, General Requirements and Scope
            
              § 281.10
              Purpose.
              (a) This part specifies the requirements that state programs must meet for approval by the Administrator under section 9004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising and withdrawing approval of state programs.
              (b) State submissions for program approval must be in accordance with the procedures set out in this part.
              (c) A state may apply for approval under this part at any time after the promulgation of release detection, prevention, and corrective action regulations under § 9003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              (d) Any state program approved by the Administrator under this part shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part.
            
            
              § 281.11
              General requirements.
              (a) State program elements. The following substantive elements of a state program must be addressed in a state application for approval:
              (1) Requirements for all existing and new underground storage tanks:
              (i) New UST systems (design, construction, installation, and notification);
              (ii) Upgrading of existing UST systems;
              (iii) General operating requirements;
              (iv) Release detection;
              (v) Release reporting, investigation, and confirmation;
              (vi) Out-of-service USTs and closure;
              (vii) Release response and corrective action;
              
              (viii) Financial responsibility for UST systems containing petroleum; and
              (ix) Operator training.
              (2) Provisions for adequate enforcement of compliance with the above program elements.
              (b) Final approval. The state must demonstrate that its requirements under each state program element for existing and new UST systems are no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements as set forth in subpart C of this part. The state must also demonstrate that it has a program that provides adequate enforcement of compliance with these requirements.
              (c) States with programs approved under this part are authorized to administer the state program in lieu of the federal program and will have primary enforcement responsibility with respect to the requirements of the approved program. EPA retains authority to take enforcement action in approved states as necessary and will notify the designated lead state agency of any such intended action.
            
            
              § 281.12
              Scope and definitions.
              (a) Scope. (1) The Administrator may approve either partial or complete state programs. A “partial” state program regulates either solely UST systems containing petroleum or solely UST systems containing hazardous substances. If a “partial” state program is approved, EPA will administer the remaining part of the program. A “complete” state program regulates both petroleum and hazardous substance tanks.
              (2) EPA will administer the UST program in Indian country, except where Congress has clearly expressed an intention to grant a state authority to regulate petroleum and hazardous substance USTs in Indian country. In either case, this decision will not impair a state's ability to obtain program approval for petroleum or hazardous substances in non-Indian country in accordance with this part.
              (3) Nothing in this subpart precludes a state from:
              (i) Adopting or enforcing requirements that are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this part; or
              (ii) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part. Where an approved state program has a greater scope of coverage than required by federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the federally-approved program.
              (b) Definitions. (1) The definitions in 40 CFR part 280 apply to this entire part except as described below.
              (i) States may use the definitions associated with tank and piping secondary containment as defined in section 9003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              (ii) States may use the definitions associated with operator training as described in § 9010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              (2) For the purposes of this part the term “final approval” means the approval received by a state program that meets the requirements in § 281.11(b).
            
          
          
            Subpart B—Components of a Program Application
            
              § 281.20
              Program application.
              Any state that seeks to administer a program under this part must submit an application containing the following parts:
              (a) A transmittal letter from the Governor of the state requesting program approval;
              (b) A description in accordance with § 281.21 of the state program and operating procedures;
              (c) A demonstration of the state's procedures to ensure adequate enforcement;
              (d) A Memorandum of Agreement outlining roles and responsibilities of EPA and the implementing agency;
              (e) An Attorney General's statement in accordance with § 281.25 certifying to applicable state authorities; and
              (f) Copies of all applicable state statutes and regulations.
            
            
              § 281.21
              Description of state program.

              A state seeking to administer a program under this part must submit a description of the program it proposes to administer under state law in lieu of the federal program. The description of a state's existing or planned program must include:
              
              (a) The scope of the state program:
              (1) Whether the state program regulates UST systems containing petroleum or hazardous substances, or both;
              (2) Whether the state program is more stringent or broader in scope than the federal program, and in what ways; and
              (3) Whether the state has any existing authority in Indian country or has existing agreements with Indian tribes relevant to the regulation of underground storage tanks.
              (b) The organization and structure of the state and local agencies with responsibility for administering the program. The jurisdiction and responsibilities of all state and local implementing agencies must be delineated, appropriate procedures for coordination set forth, and one state agency designated as a “lead agency” to facilitate communications between EPA and the state.
              (c) Staff resources to carry out and enforce the required state program elements, both existing and planned, including the number of employees, agency where employees are located, general duties of the employees, and current limits or restrictions on hiring or utilization of staff.
              (d) An existing state funding mechanism to meet the estimated costs of administering and enforcing the required state program elements, and any restrictions or limitations upon this funding.
            
            
              § 281.22
              Procedures for adequate enforcement.
              A state must submit a description of its compliance monitoring and enforcement procedures, including related state administrative or judicial review procedures.
            
            
              § 281.23
              Memorandum of agreement.
              EPA and the approved state will negotiate a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) containing proposed areas of coordination and shared responsibilities between the state and EPA and separate EPA and state roles and responsibilities in areas including, but not limited to: Implementation of partial state programs; enforcement; compliance monitoring; EPA oversight; and sharing and reporting of information. At the time of approval, the MOA must be signed by the Regional Administrator and the appropriate official of the state lead agency.
            
            
              § 281.24
              Attorney General's statement.
              (a) A state must submit a written demonstration from the Attorney General that the laws and regulations of the state provide adequate authority to carry out the program described under § 281.21 and to meet other requirements of this part. This statement may be signed by independent legal counsel for the state rather than the Attorney General, provided that such counsel has full authority to independently represent the state Agency in court on all matters pertaining to the state program. This statement must include citations to the specific statutes, administrative regulations, and where appropriate, judicial decisions that demonstrate adequate authority to regulate and enforce requirements for UST systems. State statutes and regulations cited by the state Attorney General must be fully effective when the program is approved.
              (b) If a state currently has authority over underground storage tank activities in Indian country, the statement must contain an appropriate analysis of the state's authority.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Criteria for No Less Stringent
            
              § 281.30
              New UST system design, construction, installation, and notification.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for new UST system design, construction, installation, and notification, the state must have requirements that ensure all new underground storage tanks, and the attached piping in contact with the ground and used to convey the regulated substance stored in the tank, conform to the following:

              (a) Be designed, constructed, and installed in a manner that will prevent releases for their operating life due to manufacturing defects, structural failure, or corrosion. Unless the state requires manufacturer and installer financial responsibility and installer certification in accordance with section 9003(i)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, then the state must meet the following:
              (1) New or replaced tanks and piping must use interstitial monitoring within secondary containment in accordance with section 9003(i)(1) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act except as follows:
              (i) Underground piping associated with: Airport hydrant systems or field-constructed tanks greater than 50,000 gallons or
              (ii) Underground suction piping that meets § 281.33(d)(2)(ii).

              (2) New motor fuel dispenser systems installed and connected to an UST system must be equipped with under-dispenser containment in accordance with section 9003(i)(1) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              
              
                Note to paragraph (a).
                Codes of practice developed by nationally recognized organizations and national independent testing laboratories may be used to demonstrate that the state program requirements are no less stringent in this area.
              
              
              (b) Be provided with equipment to prevent spills and tank overfills when new tanks are installed or existing tanks are upgraded, unless the tank does not receive more than 25 gallons at one time. Flow restrictors used in vent lines are not allowable forms of overfill prevention when overfill prevention is installed or replaced.
              (c) All UST system owners and operators must notify the implementing agency of the existence of any new UST system and notify the implementing agency within a reasonable timeframe when assuming ownership of an UST system using a process designated by the implementing agency.
            
            
              § 281.31
              Upgrading existing UST systems.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal upgrading requirements, the state must have requirements that ensure existing UST systems meet the requirements of § 281.30; are upgraded to prevent releases for their operating life due to corrosion, spills, or overfills; or are permanently closed with the following exceptions:

              (a) Upgrade requirements for previously deferred UST systems. Previously deferred airport hydrant fuel distribution systems and UST systems with field-constructed tanks must within three years of the effective date of its state requirements meet the requirements of § 281.30 or be permanently closed. This provision would not apply, however, to states that did not defer these UST systems and already had, prior to the effective date of this provision, existing requirements with specified compliance periods for these types of UST systems.
              (b) Upgrade requirements for other UST systems. States may allow UST systems to be upgraded if the state determines that the upgrade is appropriate to prevent releases for the operating life of the UST system due to corrosion and spills or overfills.
            
            
              § 281.32
              General operating requirements.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal general operating requirements, the state must have requirements that ensure all new and existing UST systems conform to the following:
              (a) Prevent spills and overfills by ensuring that the space in the tank is sufficient to receive the volume to be transferred and that the transfer operation is monitored constantly;

              (b) Where equipped with cathodic protection, be operated and maintained by a person with sufficient training and experience in preventing corrosion, and in a manner that ensures that no releases occur during the operating life of the UST system;
              
              
                Note to paragraph (b).
                Codes of practice developed by nationally recognized organizations and national independent testing laboratories may be used to demonstrate the state program requirements are no less stringent.
              
              

              (c) Be made of or lined with materials that are compatible with the substance stored; in order to ensure compatibility, the state requirements must also include provisions for demonstrating compatibility with new and innovative regulated substances or other regulated substances identified by the implementing agency or include other provisions determined by the implementing agency to be no less protective of human health and the environment than the provisions for demonstrating compatibility;
              (d) At the time of upgrade or repair, be structurally sound and upgraded or repaired in a manner that will prevent releases due to structural failure or corrosion during their operating lives;
              (e) Have spill and overfill prevention equipment periodically tested or inspected in a manner and frequency that ensures its functionality for the operating life of the equipment and have the integrity of containment sumps used for interstitial monitoring of piping periodically tested in a manner and frequency that prevents releases during the operating life of the UST system;
              (f) Have operation and maintenance walkthrough inspections periodically conducted in a manner and frequency that ensures proper operation and maintenance for the operating life of the UST system; and
              (g) Have records of monitoring, testing, repairs, and inspections. These records must be made readily available when requested by the implementing agency.
            
            
              § 281.33
              Release detection.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for release detection, the state must have requirements that at a minimum ensure all UST systems are provided with release detection that conforms to the following:
              (a) General methods. Release detection requirements for owners and operators must consist of a method, or combination of methods, that is:
              (1) Capable of detecting a release of the regulated substance from any portion of the UST system that routinely contains regulated substances—as effectively as any of the methods allowed under this part—for as long as the UST system is in operation. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the speed and reliability with which the release can be detected.
              (2) Designed, installed, calibrated, operated and maintained so that releases will be detected in accordance with the capabilities of the method;
              (3) Operated and maintained, and electronic and mechanical components and other equipment are tested or inspected periodically, in a manner and frequency that ensures proper operation to detect releases for the operating life of the release detection equipment.
              (b) Phase-in of requirements. Release detection requirements must, at a minimum, be applied at all UST systems immediately, except for UST systems previously deferred under § 280.10(a)(1). Release detection requirements must, at a minimum, be scheduled to be applied to those previously deferred UST systems as follows:
              (1) Immediately when a new previously deferred UST system is installed; and
              (2) For any previously deferred UST system within three years of the effective date of its state requirements. This provision would not apply, however, to states that did not defer these UST systems and already had, prior to the effective date of this provision, existing release detection requirements with specified compliance periods for these types of UST systems.
              (c) Requirements for petroleum tanks. All petroleum tanks must meet the following requirements:
              (1) All petroleum tanks must be sampled, tested, or checked for releases at least monthly, except that tanks installed before October 13, 2015 or upgraded tanks (that is, tanks and piping protected from releases due to corrosion and equipped with both spill and overfill prevention devices) may temporarily use monthly inventory control (or its equivalent) in combination with tightness testing (or its equivalent) conducted every five years for the first 10 years after the tank is installed; and

              (2) New or replaced petroleum tanks must use interstitial monitoring within secondary containment in accordance with section 9003(i)(1) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act except when the state requires manufacturer and installer financial responsibility and installer certification in accordance with section 9003(i)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              
              (d) Requirements for petroleum piping. All underground piping attached to the tank that routinely conveys petroleum must conform to the following:
              (1) If the petroleum is conveyed under greater than atmospheric pressure:
              (i) The piping must be equipped with release detection that detects a release within an hour by restricting or shutting off flow or sounding an alarm; and
              (ii) The piping must have monthly monitoring applied or annual tightness tests conducted.
              (2) If suction lines are used:
              (i) Tightness tests must be conducted at least once every three years, unless a monthly method of detection is applied to this piping; or
              (ii) The piping is designed to allow the contents of the pipe to drain back into the storage tank if the suction is released and is also designed to allow an inspector to immediately determine the integrity of the piping system.
              (3) Except as provided for in § 281.30(a)(1) new or replaced petroleum piping must use interstitial monitoring within secondary containment in accordance with section 9003(i)(1) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act except when the state requires evidence of financial responsibility and certification in accordance with section 9003(i)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              (e) Requirements for hazardous substance UST systems. All new hazardous substance UST systems must use interstitial monitoring within secondary containment of the tanks and the attached underground piping that conveys the regulated substance stored in the tank. For hazardous substance UST systems installed prior to October 13, 2015, owners and operators can use another form of release detection if the owner and operator can demonstrate to the state (or the state otherwise determines) that another method will detect a release of the regulated substance as effectively as other methods allowed under the state program for petroleum UST systems and that effective corrective action technology is available for the hazardous substance being stored that can be used to protect human health and the environment.
            
            
              § 281.34
              Release reporting, investigation, and confirmation.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for release reporting, investigation, and confirmation, the state must have requirements that ensure all owners and operators conform with the following:
              (a) Promptly investigate all suspected releases, including:
              (1) When unusual operating conditions, release detection signals and environmental conditions at the site suggest a release of regulated substances may have occurred or the interstitial space may have been compromised; and
              (2) When required by the implementing agency to determine the source of a release having an impact in the surrounding area; and
              (b) Promptly report all confirmed underground releases and any spills and overfills that are not contained and cleaned up.
              (c) Ensure that all owners and operators contain and clean up unreported spills and overfills in a manner that will protect human health and the environment.
            
            
              § 281.35
              Release response and corrective action.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for release response and corrective action, the state must have requirements that ensure:
              (a) All releases from UST systems are promptly assessed and further releases are stopped;
              (b) Actions are taken to identify, contain and mitigate any immediate health and safety threats that are posed by a release (such activities include investigation and initiation of free product removal, if present);
              (c) All releases from UST systems are investigated to determine if there are impacts on soil and groundwater, and any nearby surface waters. The extent of soil and groundwater contamination must be delineated when a potential threat to human health and the environment exists.

              (d) All releases from UST systems are cleaned up through soil and groundwater remediation and any other steps are taken, as necessary to protect human health and the environment;
              (e) Adequate information is made available to the state to demonstrate that corrective actions are taken in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. This information must be submitted in a timely manner that demonstrates its technical adequacy to protect human health and the environment; and
              (f) In accordance with § 280.67, the state must notify the affected public of all confirmed releases requiring a plan for soil and groundwater remediation, and upon request provide or make available information to inform the interested public of the nature of the release and the corrective measures planned or taken.
            
            
              § 281.36
              Out-of-service UST systems and closure.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for temporarily closed UST systems and permanent closure, the state must have requirements that ensure UST systems conform with the following:
              (a) Removal from service. All new and existing UST systems temporarily closed must:
              (1) Continue to comply with general operating requirements, release reporting and investigation, and release response and corrective action;
              (2) Continue to comply with release detection requirements if regulated substances are stored in the tank;
              (3) Be closed off to outside access; and
              (4) Be permanently closed if the UST system has not been protected from corrosion and has not been used in one year, unless the state approves an extension after the owner and operator conducts a site assessment.
              (b) Permanent closure of UST systems. All tanks and piping must be cleaned and permanently closed in a manner that eliminates the potential for safety hazards and any future releases. The owner or operator must notify the state of permanent UST system closures. The site must also be assessed to determine if there are any present or were past releases, and if so, release response and corrective action requirements must be complied with.
              (c) All UST systems taken out of service before the effective date of the federal regulations must permanently close in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section when directed by the implementing agency.
            
            
              § 281.37
              Financial responsibility for UST systems containing petroleum.
              (a) In order to be considered no less stringent than the federal requirements for financial responsibility for UST systems containing petroleum, the state requirements for financial responsibility for petroleum UST systems must ensure that:
              (1) Owners and operators have $1 million per occurrence for corrective action and third-party claims in a timely manner to protect human health and the environment;
              (2) Owners and operators not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing and who handle a throughput of 10,000 gallons of petroleum per month or less have $500,000 per occurrence for corrective action and third-party claims in a timely manner to protect human health and the environment;
              (3) Owners and operators of 1 to 100 petroleum USTs must have an annual aggregate of $1 million; and
              (4) Owners and operators of 101 or more petroleum USTs must have an annual aggregate of $2 million.
              (b) States may allow the use of a wide variety of financial assurance mechanisms to meet this requirement. Each financial mechanism must meet the following criteria in order to be no less stringent than the federal requirements. The mechanism must: Be valid and enforceable; be issued by a provider that is qualified or licensed in the state; not permit cancellation without allowing the state to draw funds; ensure that funds will only and directly be used for corrective action and third party liability costs; and require that the provider notify the owner or operator of any circumstances that would impair or suspend coverage.

              (c) States must require owners and operators to maintain records that demonstrate compliance with the state financial responsibility requirements, and these records must be made readily available when requested by the implementing agency.
            
            
              § 281.38
              Lender liability.
              (a) A state program that contains a security interest exemption will be considered to be no less stringent than, and as broad in scope as, the federal program provided that the state's exemption:
              (1) Mirrors the security interest exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I; or
              (2) Achieves the same effect as provided by the following key criteria:
              (i) A holder, meaning a person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum UST or UST system or facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located, who does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system as defined under § 280.10 of this chapter, and who does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing as defined under § 280.200(b) of this chapter is not:
              (A) An “owner” of a petroleum UST or UST system or facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located for purposes of compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 280; or
              (B) An “operator” of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 280, provided the holder is not in control of or does not have responsibility for the daily operation of the UST or UST system.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (b) [Reserved]
            
            
              § 281.39
              Operator training.
              In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for operator training, the state must have an operator training program that meets the minimum requirements of section 9010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Adequate Enforcement of Compliance
            
              § 281.40
              Requirements for compliance monitoring program and authority.
              (a) Any authorized representative of the state engaged in compliance inspections, monitoring, or testing must have authority to obtain by request any information from an owner or operator with respect to the UST system(s) that is necessary to determine compliance with the UST regulations.
              (b) Any authorized representative of the state must have authority to require an owner or operator to conduct monitoring or testing.
              (c) Authorized representatives must have the authority to enter any site or premises subject to UST regulations or in which records relevant to the operation of the UST system(s) are kept, and to copy these records, obtain samples of regulated substances, and inspect or conduct the monitoring or testing of UST system(s).
              (d) State programs must have procedures for receipt, evaluation, retention, and investigation of records and reports required of owners or operators and must provide for enforcement of failure to submit these records and reports.
              (e)(1) State programs must have inspection procedures to determine, independent of information supplied by regulated persons, compliance with program requirements, and must provide for enforcement of failure to comply with the program requirements. States must maintain a program for systematic inspections of facilities subject to UST regulations in a manner designed to determine compliance or non-compliance, to verify accuracy of information submitted by owners or operators of regulated USTs, and to verify adequacy of methods used by owners or operators in developing that information.
              (2) When inspections are conducted, samples taken, or other information gathered, these procedures must be conducted in a manner (for example, using proper “chain of custody” procedures) that will produce evidence admissible in an enforcement proceeding, or in court.

              (f) Public effort in reporting violations must be encouraged and states must make available information on reporting procedures. State programs must maintain a program for investigating information obtained from the public about suspected violations of UST program requirements.
              (g) The state must maintain the data collected through inspections and evaluation of records in such a manner that the implementing agency can monitor over time the compliance status of the regulated community. Any compilation, index, or inventory of such facilities and activities shall be made available to EPA upon request.
            
            
              § 281.41
              Requirements for enforcement authority.
              (a) Any state administering a program must have the authority to implement the following remedies for violations of state program requirements:
              (1) To restrain immediately and effectively any person by order or by suit in state court from engaging in any unauthorized activity that is endangering or causing damage to public health or the environment;
              (2) To sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any threatened or continuing violation of any program requirement;
              (3) To assess or sue to recover in court civil penalties as follows:
              (i) Civil penalties for failure to notify or for submitting false information pursuant to tank notification requirements must be capable of being assessed up to $5,000 or more per violation.
              (ii) Civil penalties for failure to comply with any state requirements or standards for existing or new tank systems must be capable of being assessed for each instance of violation, up to $5,000 or more for each tank for each day of violation. If the violation is continuous, civil penalties shall be capable of being assessed up to $5,000 or more for each day of violation.
              (4) To prohibit the delivery, deposit, or acceptance of a regulated substance into an underground storage tank identified by the implementing agency to be ineligible for such delivery, deposit, or acceptance in accordance with section 9012 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              (b) The burden of proof and degree of knowledge or intent required under state law for establishing violations under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must be no greater than the burden of proof or degree of knowledge or intent that EPA must provide when it brings an action under Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
              (c) A civil penalty assessed, sought, or agreed upon by the implementing agency(ies) under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must be appropriate to the violation.
            
            
              § 281.42
              Requirements for public participation.
              Any state administering a program must provide for public participation in the state enforcement process by providing any one of the following three options:
              (a) Authority that allows intervention analogous to Federal Rule 24(a)(2) from Title IV of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and assurance by the state that it will not oppose intervention under the state analogue to Rule 24(a)(2) on the ground that the applicant's interest is adequately represented by the state.
              (b) Authority that allows intervention of right in any civil action to obtain the remedies specified in § 281.41 by any citizen having an interest that is or may be adversely affected; or
              (c) Assurance by the appropriate state agency that:
              (1) It will provide notice and opportunity for public comment on all proposed settlements of civil enforcement actions (except where immediate action is necessary to adequately protect human health and the environment);
              (2) It will investigate and provide responses to citizen complaints about violations; and
              (3) It will not oppose citizen intervention when permissive intervention is allowed by statute, rule, or regulation.
            
            
              § 281.43
              Sharing of information.
              (a) States with approved programs must furnish EPA, upon request, any information in state files obtained or used in the administration of the state program. This information includes:

              (1) Any information submitted to the state under a claim of confidentiality. The state must submit that claim to EPA when providing such information. Any information obtained from a state and subject to a claim of confidentiality will be treated in accordance with federal regulations in 40 CFR part 2; and
              (2) Any information that is submitted to the state without a claim of confidentiality. EPA may make this information available to the public without further notice.
              (b) EPA must furnish to states with approved programs, upon request, any information in EPA files that the state needs to administer its approved state program. Such information includes:
              (1) Any information that is submitted to EPA without a claim of confidentiality; and
              (2) Any information submitted to EPA under a claim of confidentiality, subject to the conditions in 40 CFR part 2.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Approval Procedures
            
              § 281.50
              Approval procedures for state programs.
              (a) The following procedures are required for all applications, regardless of whether the application is for a partial or complete program, as defined in § 281.12.
              (b) Before submitting an application to EPA for approval of a state program, the state must provide an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program.
              (c) When EPA receives a state program application, EPA will examine the application and notify the state whether its application is complete, in accordance with the application components required in § 281.20. The 180-day statutory review period begins only after EPA has determined that a complete application has been received.
              (d) The state and EPA may by mutual agreement extend the review period.

              (e) After receipt of a complete program application, the Administrator will tentatively determine approval or disapproval of the state program. EPA shall issue public notice of the tentative determination in the Federal Register and other mechanisms to attract state-wide attention. Notice of the tentative determination must also:
              (1) Afford the public 30 days after the notice to comment on the state's application and the Administrator's tentative determination; and
              (2) Include a general statement of the areas of concern, if the Administrator indicates the state program may not be approved; and
              (3) Note the availability for inspection by the public of the state program application; and
              (4) Indicate that a public hearing will be held by EPA no earlier than 30 days after notice of the tentative determination unless insufficient public interest is expressed, at which time the Regional Administrator may cancel the public hearing.

              (f) Within 180 days of receipt of a complete state program application, the Administrator must make a final determination whether to approve the state program after review of all public comments. EPA will give notice of its determination in the Federal Register and codify the approved state program. The notice must include a statement of the reasons for this determination and a response to significant comments received.
            
            
              § 281.51
              Revision of approved state programs.
              (a) Either EPA or the approved state may initiate program revision. Program revision may be necessary when the controlling federal or state statutory or regulatory authority is changed or when responsibility for the state program is shifted to a new agency or agencies. The state must inform EPA of any proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory authority or change in division of responsibility among state agencies. EPA will determine in each case whether a revision of the approved program is required. Approved state programs must submit a revised application within three years of any changes to this part that requires a program revision.

              (b) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that circumstances have changed with respect to an approved state program or the federal program, the Administrator may request, and the state must provide, a revised application as prescribed by EPA.
              (c) The Administrator will approve or disapprove program revisions based on the requirements of this part and Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act pursuant to the procedures under this section, or under § 281.50 if EPA has reason to believe the proposed revision will receive significant negative comment from the public.

              (1) The Administrator must issue public notice of planned approval or disapproval of a state program revision in the Federal Register and other mechanisms to attract state-wide attention. The public notice must summarize the state program revision, indicate whether EPA intends to approve or disapprove the revision, and provide for an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days.

              (2) The Administrator's decision on the proposed revision becomes effective 60 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless significant negative comment opposing the proposed revision is received during the comment period. If significant negative comment is received, EPA must notify the state and within 60 days after the date of publication, publish in the Federal Register either:
              (i) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision, which will then be treated as a tentative decision in accordance with the applicable procedures of § 281.50(e) and (f); or
              (ii) A notice that contains a response to significant negative comments and affirms either that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.

              (d) Revised state programs that receive approval must be codified in the Federal Register.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Withdrawal of Approval of State Programs
            
              § 281.60
              Criteria for withdrawal of approval of state programs.
              The Administrator may withdraw program approval when the Agency determines that a state no longer has adequate regulatory or statutory authority or is not administering and enforcing an approved program in accordance with this part. The state must have adequate capability to administer and enforce the state program. In evaluating whether such capability exists, the Agency will consider whether the state is implementing an adequate enforcement program by evaluating the quality of compliance monitoring and enforcement actions.
            
            
              § 281.61
              Procedures for withdrawal of approval of state programs.
              (a) The following procedures apply when a state with an approved program voluntarily transfers to EPA those program responsibilities required by federal law.
              (1) The state must give EPA notice of the proposed transfer, and submit, at least 90 days before the transfer, a plan for the orderly transfer of all relevant program information necessary for EPA to administer the program.

              § 282.55
              Colorado State-Administered Program.

              (a) The State of Colorado is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq. The State's program, as administered by the Colorado Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Division of Environmental Response and Remediation (DERR), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Colorado underground storage tank base program effective on April 23, 2007. A subsequent program revision application was approved by EPA and became effective on July 19, 2019.
              (b) Colorado has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under Sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h),6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.

              (c) To retain program approval, Colorado must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with Section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Colorado obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to Section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart, and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.
              (d) Colorado has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to the EPA and approved effective April 23, 2007, and the program revision application approved by the EPA effective on July 19, 2019:

              (a) The State of Hawaii's underground storage tank program is approved in lieu of the Federal program in accordance with Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq. The State's program, as administered by the Hawaii Department of Health, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. EPA approved the Hawaii underground storage tank program on September 25, 2002, and approval was effective on September 30, 2002.
              (b) Hawaii has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities in accordance with sections 9005 and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, regardless of whether the State has taken its own actions, as well as in accordance with other statutory and regulatory provisions.

              (c) To retain program approval, Hawaii must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program that make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Hawaii obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.
              

              (d) Hawaii has final approval for the following elements submitted to EPA in the State's program application for final approval. On September 25, 2002, EPA published a rule approving the State's program in the Federal Register, 67 FR 60161. That approval became effective on September 30, 2002. Copies of Hawaii's program application may be obtained from the Hawaii Department of Health, Solid and Hazardous Waste Branch, 919 Ala Moana Boulevard, Suite 212, Honolulu, HI 96814.

EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Oregon underground storage tank program on September 16, 2011, and it became effective on that date.
              (b) Oregon has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9003(h), 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d and 6991e, as well as its authority under other statutory and regulatory provisions.

              (c) To retain program approval, Oregon must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Oregon obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.

              Utah State-Administered Program.
              (a) History of the approval of Utah's Program. The State of Utah is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq. The State's program, as administered by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Division of Environmental Response and Remediation (DERR), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and Part 281 of this Chapter. EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Utah underground storage tank base program effective on April 7, 1995. A subsequent program revision application was approved by EPA and became effective on January 4, 2019.
              (b) Enforcement authority. Utah has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h),6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.

              (c) To retain program approval, Utah must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Utah obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.
              (d) Utah has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to EPA and approved effective April 7, 1995, and the program revision application approved by EPA effective on January 4, 2019:
