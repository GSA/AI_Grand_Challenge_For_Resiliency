      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 63.6585</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a stationary RICE at a major or area source of HAP emissions, except if the stationary RICE is being tested at a stationary RICE test cell/stand.</P>
                <P>(a) A stationary RICE is any internal combustion engine which uses reciprocating motion to convert heat energy into mechanical work and which is not mobile. Stationary RICE differ from mobile RICE in that a stationary RICE is not a non-road engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30, and is not used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition.</P>

                <P>(b) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 <PRTPAGE P="17"/>megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas production facilities, a major source of HAP emissions is determined for each surface site.</P>
                <P>(c) An area source of HAP emissions is a source that is not a major source.</P>
                <P>(d) If you are an owner or operator of an area source subject to this subpart, your status as an entity subject to a standard or other requirements under this subpart does not subject you to the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, provided you are not required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a) for a reason other than your status as an area source under this subpart. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart as applicable.</P>
                <P>(e) If you are an owner or operator of a stationary RICE used for national security purposes, you may be eligible to request an exemption from the requirements of this subpart as described in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart C.</P>
                <P>(f) The emergency stationary RICE listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section are not subject to this subpart. The stationary RICE must meet the definition of an emergency stationary RICE in § 63.6675, which includes operating according to the provisions specified in § 63.6640(f).</P>
                <P>(1) Existing residential emergency stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per calendar year for the purposes specified in § 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in § 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).</P>
                <P>(2) Existing commercial emergency stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per calendar year for the purposes specified in § 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in § 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).</P>
                <P>(3) Existing institutional emergency stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per calendar year for the purposes specified in § 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in § 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).</P>

If any of the limits are exceeded, the engine owner or operator must change the oil within 2 business days of receiving the results of the analysis; if the engine is not in operation when the results of the analysis are received, the engine owner or operator must change the oil within 2 business days or before commencing operation, whichever is later. The owner or operator must keep records of the parameters that are analyzed as part of the program, the results of the analysis, and the oil changes for the engine. The analysis program must be part of the maintenance plan for the engine.</P>

                <P>(j) If you own or operate a stationary SI engine that is subject to the work, operation or management practices in items 6, 7, or 8 of Table 2c to this subpart or in items 5, 6, 7, 9, or 11 of Table 2d to this subpart, you have the option of utilizing an oil analysis program in order to extend the specified oil change requirement in Tables 2c and 2d to this subpart. The oil analysis must be performed at the same frequency specified for changing the oil in Table 2c or 2d to this subpart. The analysis program must at a minimum analyze the following three parameters: Total Acid Number, viscosity, and percent water <PRTPAGE P="30"/>content. The condemning limits for these parameters are as follows: Total Acid Number increases by more than 3.0 milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) per gram from Total Acid Number of the oil when new; viscosity of the oil has changed by more than 20 percent from the viscosity of the oil when new; or percent water content (by volume) is greater than 0.5. If all of these condemning limits are not exceeded, the engine owner or operator is not required to change the oil. If any of the limits are exceeded, the engine owner or operator must change the oil within 2 business days of receiving the results of the analysis; if the engine is not in operation when the results of the analysis are received, the engine owner or operator must change the oil within 2 business days or before commencing operation, whichever is later. The owner or operator must keep records of the parameters that are analyzed as part of the program, the results of the analysis, and the oil changes for the engine. The analysis program must be part of the maintenance plan for the engine.</P>

                <P>(a) If you must comply with emission and operating limitations, you must monitor and collect data according to this section.</P>
                <P>(b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, required performance evaluations, and required quality assurance or control activities, you must monitor continuously at all times that the stationary RICE is operating. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</P>
                <P>(c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels. You must, however, use all the valid data collected during all other periods.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations, operating limitations, and other requirements?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limitation, operating limitation, and other requirements in Tables 1a and 1b, Tables 2a and 2b, Table 2c, and Table 2d to this subpart that apply to you according to methods specified in Table 6 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each emission limitation or operating limitation in Tables 1a and 1b, Tables 2a and 2b, Table 2c, and Table 2d to this subpart that apply to you. These instances are deviations from the emission and operating limitations in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.6650. If you change your catalyst, you must reestablish the values of the operating parameters measured during the initial performance test. When you reestablish the values of your operating parameters, you must also conduct a performance test to demonstrate that you are meeting the required emission limitation applicable to your stationary RICE.</P>
                <P>(c) The annual compliance demonstration required for existing non-emergency 4SLB and 4SRB stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 HP located at an area source of HAP that are not remote stationary RICE and that are operated more than 24 hours per calendar year must be conducted according to the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) The compliance demonstration must consist of at least one test run.</P>
                <P>(2) Each test run must be of at least 15 minute duration, except that each test conducted using the method in appendix A to this subpart must consist of at least one measurement cycle and include at least 2 minutes of test data phase measurement.</P>
                <P>(3) If you are demonstrating compliance with the CO concentration or CO percent reduction requirement, you must measure CO emissions using one of the CO measurement methods specified in Table 4 of this subpart, or using appendix A to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) If you are demonstrating compliance with the THC percent reduction requirement, you must measure THC emissions using Method 25A, reported as propane, of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
                <P>(5) You must measure O<E T="52">2</E> using one of the O<E T="52">2</E> measurement methods specified in Table 4 of this subpart. Measurements to determine O<E T="52">2</E> concentration must be made at the same time as the measurements for CO or THC concentration.</P>

                <P>(6) If you are demonstrating compliance with the CO or THC percent reduction requirement, you must measure CO or THC emissions and O<E T="52">2</E> emissions simultaneously at the inlet and outlet of the control device.</P>

                <P>(7) If the results of the annual compliance demonstration show that the emissions exceed the levels specified in Table 6 of this subpart, the stationary RICE must be shut down as soon as safely possible, and appropriate corrective action must be taken (e.g., repairs, <PRTPAGE P="32"/>catalyst cleaning, catalyst replacement). The stationary RICE must be retested within 7 days of being restarted and the emissions must meet the levels specified in Table 6 of this subpart. If the retest shows that the emissions continue to exceed the specified levels, the stationary RICE must again be shut down as soon as safely possible, and the stationary RICE may not operate, except for purposes of startup and testing, until the owner/operator demonstrates through testing that the emissions do not exceed the levels specified in Table 6 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(d) For new, reconstructed, and rebuilt stationary RICE, deviations from the emission or operating limitations that occur during the first 200 hours of operation from engine startup (engine burn-in period) are not violations. Rebuilt stationary RICE means a stationary RICE that has been rebuilt as that term is defined in 40 CFR 94.11(a).</P>
                <P>(e) You must also report each instance in which you did not meet the requirements in Table 8 to this subpart that apply to you. If you own or operate a new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions (except new or reconstructed 4SLB engines greater than or equal to 250 and less than or equal to 500 brake HP), a new or reconstructed stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions, or any of the following RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you do not need to comply with the requirements in Table 8 to this subpart: An existing 2SLB stationary RICE, an existing 4SLB stationary RICE, an existing emergency stationary RICE, an existing limited use stationary RICE, or an existing stationary RICE which fires landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis. If you own or operate any of the following RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you do not need to comply with the requirements in Table 8 to this subpart, except for the initial notification requirements: a new or reconstructed stationary RICE that combusts landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, a new or reconstructed emergency stationary RICE, or a new or reconstructed limited use stationary RICE.</P>
                <P>(f) If you own or operate an emergency stationary RICE, you must operate the emergency stationary RICE according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section. In order for the engine to be considered an emergency stationary RICE under this subpart, any operation other than emergency operation, maintenance and testing, emergency demand response, and operation in non-emergency situations for 50 hours per year, as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, is prohibited. If you do not operate the engine according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, the engine will not be considered an emergency engine under this subpart and must meet all requirements for non-emergency engines.</P>
                <P>(1) There is no time limit on the use of emergency stationary RICE in emergency situations.</P>
                <P>(2) You may operate your emergency stationary RICE for any combination of the purposes specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section for a maximum of 100 hours per calendar year. Any operation for non-emergency situations as allowed by paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of this section counts as part of the 100 hours per calendar year allowed by this paragraph (f)(2).</P>

                <P>(i) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for maintenance checks and readiness testing, provided that the tests are recommended by federal, state or local government, the manufacturer, the vendor, the regional transmission organization or equivalent balancing authority and transmission operator, or the insurance company associated with the engine. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for approval of additional hours to be used for maintenance checks and readiness testing, but a petition is not required if the owner or operator maintains records indicating that federal, state, or local standards require maintenance and <PRTPAGE P="33"/>testing of emergency RICE beyond 100 hours per calendar year.</P>
                <P>(ii) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for emergency demand response for periods in which the Reliability Coordinator under the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard EOP-002-3, Capacity and Energy Emergencies (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or other authorized entity as determined by the Reliability Coordinator, has declared an Energy Emergency Alert Level 2 as defined in the NERC Reliability Standard EOP-002-3.</P>
                <P>(iii) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for periods where there is a deviation of voltage or frequency of 5 percent or greater below standard voltage or frequency.</P>
                <P>(3) Emergency stationary RICE located at major sources of HAP may be operated for up to 50 hours per calendar year in non-emergency situations. The 50 hours of operation in non-emergency situations are counted as part of the 100 hours per calendar year for maintenance and testing and emergency demand response provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations cannot be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response, or to generate income for a facility to supply power to an electric grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity.</P>
                <P>(4) Emergency stationary RICE located at area sources of HAP may be operated for up to 50 hours per calendar year in non-emergency situations. The 50 hours of operation in non-emergency situations are counted as part of the 100 hours per calendar year for maintenance and testing and emergency demand response provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, the 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations cannot be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response, or to generate income for a facility to an electric grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity.</P>
                <P>(i) Prior to May 3, 2014, the 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations can be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response to generate income for a facility, or to otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity if the engine is operated as part of a peak shaving (load management program) with the local distribution system operator and the power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local distribution system.</P>
                <P>(ii) The 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations can be used to supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(A) The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator.</P>
                <P>(B) The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or distribution limitations so as to avert potential voltage collapse or line overloads that could lead to the interruption of power supply in a local area or region.</P>
                <P>(C) The dispatch follows reliability, emergency operation or similar protocols that follow specific NERC, regional, state, public utility commission or local standards or guidelines.</P>
                <P>(D) The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local transmission and distribution system.</P>
                <P>(E) The owner or operator identifies and records the entity that dispatches the engine and the specific NERC, regional, state, public utility commission or local standards or guidelines that are being followed for dispatching the engine. The local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator may keep these records on behalf of the engine owner or operator.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.2 Applicability. When is this protocol acceptable?</HD>
              <P>This protocol is applicable to 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ. Because of inherent cross sensitivities of EC cells, you must not apply this protocol to other emissions sources without specific instruction to that effect.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.3 Data Quality Objectives. How good must my collected data be?</HD>
              <P>Refer to Section 13 to verify and document acceptable analyzer performance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.4 Range. What is the targeted analytical range for this protocol?</HD>

              <P>The measurement system and EC cell design(s) conforming to this protocol will determine the analytical range for each gas component. The nominal ranges are defined by choosing up-scale calibration gas concentrations near the maximum anticipated flue gas concentrations for CO and O<E T="52">2</E>, or no more than twice the permitted CO level.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.5 Sensitivity. What minimum detectable limit will this protocol yield for a particular gas component?</HD>
              <P>The minimum detectable limit depends on the nominal range and resolution of the specific EC cell used, and the signal to noise ratio of the measurement system. The minimum detectable limit should be 2 percent of the nominal range or 1 ppm, whichever is less restrictive.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2.0 Summary of Protocol</HD>

              <P>In this protocol, a gas sample is extracted from an engine exhaust system and then conveyed to a portable EC analyzer for measurement of CO and O<E T="52">2</E> gas concentrations. This method provides measurement system performance specifications and sampling protocols to ensure reliable data. You may use additions to, or modifications of vendor supplied measurement systems (e.g., heated or unheated sample lines, thermocouples, flow meters, selective gas scrubbers, etc.) to meet the design specifications of this protocol. Do not make changes to the measurement system from the as-verified configuration (Section 3.12).</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">3.1.4 Moisture Removal System.</E> Any device used to reduce the concentration of moisture in the sample stream so as to protect the EC cells from the damaging effects of condensation and to minimize errors in measurements caused by the scrubbing of soluble gases.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">3.2 Nominal Range.</E> The range of analyte concentrations over which each EC cell is operated (normally 25 percent to 150 percent of up-scale calibration gas value). Several <PRTPAGE P="65"/>nominal ranges can be used for any given cell so long as the calibration and repeatability checks for that range remain within specifications.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">3.9 Sampling Run.</E> A timed three-phase event whereby an EC cell's response rises and plateaus in a sample conditioning phase, remains relatively constant during a measurement data phase, then declines during a refresh phase. The sample conditioning phase exposes the EC cell to the gas sample for a length of time sufficient to reach a constant response. The measurement data phase is the time interval during which gas sample measurements can be made that meet the acceptance criteria of this protocol. The refresh phase then purges the EC cells with CO-free air. The refresh phase replenishes requisite O<E T="52">2</E> and moisture in the electrolyte reserve and provides a mechanism to de-gas or desorb any interference gas scrubbers or filters so as to enable a stable CO EC cell response. There are four primary types of sampling runs: pre- sampling calibrations; stack gas sampling; post-sampling calibration checks; and measurement system repeatability checks. Stack gas sampling runs can be chained together for extended evaluations, providing all other procedural specifications are met.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive pushing emissions if I have a by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You must meet each requirement in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section for each new or existing by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues.</P>
                <P>(1) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive pushing emissions from each oven at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be observed during a 90-day period due to circumstances that were not reasonably avoidable, you must observe the opacity of the first push of that oven following the close of the 90-day period that is capable of being observed in accordance with the procedures in § 63.7334(a), and you must document why the oven was not observed within a 90-day period. All opacity observations of fugitive pushing emissions for batteries with vertical flues must be made using the procedures in § 63.7334(a).</P>
                <P>(2) If two or more batteries are served by the same pushing equipment and total no more than 90 ovens, the batteries as a unit can be considered a single battery.</P>

                <P>(3) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive pushing emissions for at least four consecutive pushes per battery each day. Exclude any push during which the observer's view is obstructed <PRTPAGE P="106"/>or obscured by interferences and observe the next available push to complete the set of four pushes. If necessary due to circumstances that were not reasonably avoidable, you may observe fewer than four consecutive pushes in a day; however, you must observe and record as many consecutive pushes as possible and document why four consecutive pushes could not be observed. You may observe and record one or more non-consecutive pushes in addition to any consecutive pushes observed in a day.</P>
                <P>(4) Do not alter the pushing schedule to change the sequence of consecutive pushes to be observed on any day. Keep records indicating the legitimate operational reason for any change in your pushing schedule which results in a change in the sequence of consecutive pushes observed on any day.</P>

                <P>(5) If the average opacity for any individual push exceeds 30 percent opacity for any short battery or 35 percent opacity for any tall battery, you must take corrective action and/or increase coking time for that oven. You must complete corrective action or increase coking time within either 10 calendar days or the number of days determined using Equation 1 of this section, whichever is greater:

                <FP>For the purpose of determining the number of calendar days allowed under Equation 1 of this section, day one is the first day following the day you observed an opacity in excess of 30 percent for any short battery or 35 percent for any tall battery. Any fraction produced by Equation 1 of this section must be counted as a whole day. Days during which the oven is removed from service are not included in the number of days allowed to complete corrective action.</FP>
                <P>(6)(i) You must demonstrate that the corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful. After a period of time no longer than the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes for the oven capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). The corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful if the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery. If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful, you may return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful, and you must complete additional corrective action and/or increase coking time for that oven within the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) After implementing any additional corrective action and/or increased coking time required under paragraph (a)(6)(i) or (a)(7)(ii) of this section, you must demonstrate that corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful. After a period of time no longer than the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes for the oven capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). The corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful if the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery. If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful, you may return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful, and you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section.</P>

                <P>(iii) If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful as described in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, you must repeat the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section until the corrective action and/or increased coking time is successful. <PRTPAGE P="107"/>You must report to the permitting authority as a deviation each unsuccessful attempt at corrective action and/or increased coking time under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(7)(i) If at any time you place an oven on increased coking time as a result of fugitive pushing emissions that exceed 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, you must keep the oven on the increased coking time until the oven qualifies for decreased coking time using the procedures in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) or (a)(7)(iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) To qualify for a decreased coking time for an oven placed on increased coking time in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) or (6) of this section, you must operate the oven on the decreased coking time. After no more than two coking cycles on the decreased coking time, you must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes that are capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). If the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery, you may keep the oven on the decreased coking time and return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the attempt to qualify for a decreased coking time was unsuccessful. You must then return the oven to the previously established increased coking time, or implement other corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time. If you implement other corrective action and/or a coking time that is shorter than the previously established increased coking time, you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section to confirm that the corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time was successful.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the attempt to qualify for decreased coking time was unsuccessful as described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section, you may again attempt to qualify for decreased coking time for the oven. To do this, you must operate the oven on the decreased coking time. After no more than two coking cycles on the decreased coking time, you must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes that are capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). If the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery, you may keep the oven on the decreased coking time and return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the attempt to qualify for a decreased coking time was unsuccessful. You must then return the oven to the previously established increased coking time, or implement other corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time. If you implement other corrective action and/or a coking time that is shorter than the previously established increased coking time, you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section to confirm that the corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time was successful.</P>
                <P>(iv) You must report to the permitting authority as a deviation the second and any subsequent consecutive unsuccessful attempts on the same oven to qualify for decreased coking time as described in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) As provided in § 63.6(g), you may request to use an alternative to the work practice standards in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) You must comply with each of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(1) Prepare and operate by a written plan that will eliminate or minimize incomplete coking for each by-product coke oven battery with horizontal flues. You must submit the plan and supporting documentation to the Administrator (or delegated authority) for approval no later than 90 days after completing all observations and measurements required for the study in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or April 14, 2004, whichever is earlier. You must <PRTPAGE P="108"/>begin operating by the plan requirements by the compliance date that is specified in § 63.7283. The written plan must identify minimum flue temperatures for different coking times and a battery-wide minimum acceptable flue temperature for any oven at any coking time.</P>
                <P>(2) Submit the written plan and supporting documentation to the Administrator (or delegated authority) for review and approval. Include all data collected during the study described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If the Administrator (or delegated authority) disapproves the plan, you must revise the plan as directed by the Administrator (or delegated authority) and submit the amended plan for approval. The Administrator (or delegated authority) may require you to collect and submit additional data. You must operate according to your submitted plan (or submitted amended plan, if any) until the Administrator (or delegated authority) approves your plan.</P>
                <P>(3) You must base your written plan on a study that you conduct that meets each of the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (x) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Initiate the study by July 14, 2003. Notify the Administrator (or delegated authority) at least 7 days prior to initiating the study according to the requirements in § 63.7340(f).</P>
                <P>(ii) Conduct the study under representative operating conditions, including but not limited to the range of moisture content and volatile matter in the coal that is charged.</P>
                <P>(iii) Include every oven in the study and observe at least two pushes from each oven.</P>
                <P>(iv) For each push observed, measure and record the temperature of every flue within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time. Document the oven number, date, and time the oven was charged and pushed, and calculate the net coking time.</P>
                <P>(v) For each push observed, document the factors to be used to identify pushes that are incompletely coked. These factors must include (but are not limited to): average opacity during the push, average opacity during travel to the quench tower, average of six highest consecutive observations during both push and travel, highest single opacity reading, color of the emissions (especially noting any yellow or brown emissions), presence of excessive smoke during travel to the quench tower, percent volatile matter in the coke, percent volatile matter and percent moisture in the coal that is charged, and the date the oven was last rebuilt or completely relined. Additional documentation may be provided in the form of pictures or videotape of emissions during the push and travel. All opacity observations must be conducted in accordance with the procedures in § 63.7334(a)(3) through (7).</P>
                <P>(vi) Inspect the inside walls of the oven after each observed push for cool spots as indicated by a flue that is darker than others (the oven walls should be red hot) and record the results.</P>

                <P>(vii) For each push observed, note where incomplete coking occurs if possible (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> coke side end, pusher side end, top, or center of the coke mass). For any push with incomplete coking, investigate and document the probable cause.</P>
                <P>(viii) Use the documented factors in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section to identify pushes that were completely coked and those that were not completely coked. Provide a rationale for the determination based on the documentation of factors observed during the study.</P>
                <P>(ix) Use only the flue temperature and coking time data for pushes that were completely coked to identify minimum flue temperatures for various coking times. Submit the criteria used to determine complete coking, as well as a table of coking times and corresponding temperatures for complete coking as part of your plan.</P>
                <P>(x) Determine the battery-wide minimum acceptable flue temperature for any oven. This temperature will be equal to the lowest temperature that provided complete coking as determined in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this section.</P>

                <P>(4) You must operate according to the coking times and temperatures in your approved plan and the requirements in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (viii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="109"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Measure and record the percent volatile matter in the coal that is charged.</P>
                <P>(ii) Measure and record the temperature of all flues on two ovens per day within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time for each oven. Measure and record the temperature of all flues on each oven at least once each month.</P>
                <P>(iii) For each oven observed in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, record the time each oven is charged and pushed and calculate and record the net coking time. If any measured flue temperature for an oven is below the minimum flue temperature for an oven's scheduled coking time as established in the written plan, increase the coking time for the oven to the coking time in the written plan for the observed flue temperature before pushing the oven.</P>
                <P>(iv) If you increased the coking time for any oven in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, you must investigate the cause of the low flue temperature and take corrective action to fix the problem. You must continue to measure and record the temperature of all flues for the oven within 2 hours before each scheduled pushing time until the measurements meet the minimum temperature requirements for the increased coking time for two consecutive pushes. If any measured flue temperature for an oven on increased coking time falls below the minimum flue temperature for the increased coking time, as established in the written plan, you must increase the coking time for the oven to the coking time specified in the written plan for the observed flue temperature before pushing the oven. The oven must continue to operate at this coking time (or at a longer coking time if the temperature falls below the minimum allowed for the increased coking time) until the problem has been corrected, and you have confirmed that the corrective action was successful as required by paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section.</P>
                <P>(v) Once the heating problem has been corrected, the oven may be returned to the battery's normal coking schedule. You must then measure and record the flue temperatures for the oven within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time for the next two consecutive pushes. If any flue temperature measurement is below the minimum flue temperature for that coking time established in the written plan, repeat the procedures in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(vi) If any flue temperature measurement is below the battery-wide minimum acceptable temperature for complete coking established in the written plan for any oven at any coking time, you must remove the oven from service for repairs.</P>
                <P>(vii) For an oven that has been repaired and returned to service after being removed from service in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section, you must measure and record the temperatures of all flues for the oven within 2 hours before the first scheduled pushing time. If any flue temperature measurement is below the minimum flue temperature for the scheduled coking time, as established in the written plan, you must repeat the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(viii) For an oven that has been repaired and returned to service after removal from service in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section, you must report as a deviation to the permitting authority any flue temperature measurement made during the initial coking cycle after return to service that is below the lowest acceptable minimum flue temperature.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards that apply to me?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For each by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues subject to the work practice standards for fugitive pushing emissions in § 63.7291(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance according to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions for four consecutive pushes per operating day, except you may make fewer or non-consecutive observations as permitted by § 63.7291(a)(3). Maintain records of the pushing schedule for each oven and records indicating the legitimate operational reason for any change in the pushing schedule according to § 63.7291(a)(4).</P>
                <P>(2) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions from each oven in a battery at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be observed during a 90-day period, observe and record the opacity of the first push of that oven following the close of the 90-day period that can be read in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Make all observations and calculations for opacity observations of fugitive pushing emissions in accordance with Method 9 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 using a Method 9 certified observer unless you have an approved alternative procedure under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) Record pushing opacity observations at 15-second intervals as required in section 2.4 of Method 9 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). The requirement in section 2.4 of Method 9 for a minimum of 24 observations does not apply, and the data reduction requirements in section 2.5 of Method 9 do not apply. The requirement in § 63.6(h)(5)(ii)(B) for obtaining at least 3 hours of observations (thirty 6-minute averages) to demonstrate initial compliance does not apply.</P>

                <P>(5) If fewer than six but at least four 15-second observations can be made, use the average of the total number of observations to calculate average opacity for the push. Missing one or more observations during the push (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> as the quench car passes behind a building) does not invalidate the observations before or after the interference for that push. However, a minimum of four 15-second readings must be made for a valid observation.</P>
                <P>(6) Begin observations for a push at the first detectable movement of the coke mass. End observations of a push when the quench car enters the quench tower.</P>
                <P>(i) For a battery without a cokeside shed, observe fugitive pushing emissions from a position at least 10 meters from the quench car that provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences from the topside of the battery. This may require the observer to be positioned at an angle to the quench car rather than perpendicular to it. Typical interferences to avoid include emissions from open standpipes and charging. Observe the opacity of emissions above the battery top with the sky as the background where possible. Record the oven number of any push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.</P>

                <P>(ii) For a battery with a cokeside shed, the observer must be in a position that provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences from the topside of the battery. Typical interferences to avoid include emissions from open standpipes and charging. Observations must include any fugitive emissions that escape from the top of the shed, from the ends of the shed, or from the area where the shed is joined to the battery. If the observer does not have a clear view to identify when a push starts or ends, a second person can be positioned to signal the start or end of the push and notify the observer when to start or end the observations. Radio communications with other <PRTPAGE P="123"/>plant personnel (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> pushing ram operator or quench car operator) may also serve to notify the observer of the start or end of a push. Record the oven number of any push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.</P>
                <P>(iii) You may reposition after the push to observe emissions during travel if necessary.</P>
                <P>(7) If it is infeasible to implement the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section for an oven due to physical obstructions, nighttime pushes, or other reasons, you may apply to your permitting authority for permission to use an alternative procedure. The application must provide a detailed explanation of why it is infeasible to use the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section, identify the oven and battery numbers, and describe the alternative procedure. An alternative procedure must identify whether the coke in that oven is not completely coked, either before, during, or after an oven is pushed.</P>
                <P>(8) For each oven observed that exceeds an opacity of 30 percent for any short battery or 35 percent for any tall battery, you must take corrective action and/or increase the coking time in accordance with § 63.7291(a). Maintain records documenting conformance with the requirements in § 63.7291(a).</P>
                <P>(b) For each by-product coke oven battery with horizontal flues subject to the work practice standards for fugitive pushing emissions in § 63.7292(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by having met the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Measuring and recording the temperature of all flues on two ovens per day within 2 hours before the oven's scheduled pushing time and ensuring that the temperature of each oven is measured and recorded at least once every month;</P>
                <P>(2) Recording the time each oven is charged and pushed and calculating and recording the net coking time for each oven; and</P>
                <P>(3) Increasing the coking time for each oven that falls below the minimum flue temperature trigger established for that oven's coking time in the written plan required in § 63.7292(a)(1), assigning the oven to the oven-directed program, and recording all relevant information according to the requirements in § 63.7292(a)(4) including, but not limited to, daily pushing schedules, diagnostic procedures, corrective actions, and oven repairs.</P>
                <P>(c) For each non-recovery coke oven battery subject to the work practice standards in § 63.7293(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by maintaining records that document each visual inspection of an oven prior to pushing and that the oven was not pushed unless there was no smoke in the open space above the coke bed and there was an unobstructed view of the door on the opposite side of the oven.</P>

                <P>(d) Boilers and process heaters with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour in the units designed to burn gas 2 (other) fuels subcategory or units designed to burn light liquid fuels subcategory must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540.</P>
                <P>(e) Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity greater than 5 million Btu per hour and less than 10 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 2 years as specified in § 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.</P>

                <P>(4) Conduct CMS performance evaluations according to § 63.7525.</P>
                <P>(b) For each boiler or process heater that you elect to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits in Tables 1 or 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart for HCl, mercury, or TSM through fuel analysis, your initial compliance requirement is to conduct a fuel analysis for each type of fuel burned in your boiler or process heater according to § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart and establish operating limits according to § 63.7530 and Table 8 to this subpart. The fuels described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are exempt from these fuel analysis and operating limit requirements. The fuels described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section are exempt from the chloride fuel analysis and operating limit requirements. Boilers and process heaters that use a CEMS for mercury or HCl are exempt from the performance testing and operating limit requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the HAP for which CEMS are used.</P>
                <P>(c) If your boiler or process heater is subject to a carbon monoxide (CO) limit, your initial compliance demonstration for CO is to conduct a performance test for CO according to Table 5 to this subpart or conduct a performance evaluation of your continuous CO monitor, if applicable, according to § 63.7525(a). Boilers and process heaters that use a CO CEMS to comply with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, as specified in § 63.7525(a), are exempt from the initial CO performance testing and oxygen concentration operating limit requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) If your boiler or process heater is subject to a PM limit, your initial compliance demonstration for PM is to conduct a performance test in accordance with § 63.7520 and Table 5 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(e) For existing affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490), you must complete the initial compliance demonstrations, as specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, no later than 180 days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.7495 and according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 10 to this subpart, except as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. You must complete an initial tune-up by following the procedures described in § 63.7540(a)(10)(i) through (vi) no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.7495, except as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. You must complete the one-time energy assessment specified in Table 3 to this subpart no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.7495.</P>

                <P>(f) For new or reconstructed affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490), you must complete the initial compliance demonstration with the emission limits no later than July 30, 2013 or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later. If you are demonstrating compliance with an emission limit in Tables 11 through 13 to this subpart that is less stringent (that is, higher) than the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must demonstrate compliance with the <PRTPAGE P="137"/>applicable emission limit in Table 1 no later than July 29, 2016.</P>
                <P>(g) For new or reconstructed affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable work practice standards in Table 3 to this subpart within the applicable annual, biennial, or 5-year schedule as specified in § 63.7515(d) following the initial compliance date specified in § 63.7495(a). Thereafter, you are required to complete the applicable annual, biennial, or 5-year tune-up as specified in § 63.7515(d).</P>

                <P>(a) You must conduct all applicable performance tests according to § 63.7520 on an annual basis, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (e), (g), and (h) of this section. Annual performance tests must be completed no more than 13 months after the previous performance test, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (e), (g), and (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) If your performance tests for a given pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the emission limit (or, in limited instances as specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, at or below the emission limit) for the pollutant, and if there are no changes in the operation of the individual boiler or process heater or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year. Each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test. If you elect to demonstrate compliance using emission averaging under § 63.7522, you must continue to conduct performance tests annually. The requirement to test at maximum chloride input level is waived unless the stack test is conducted for HCl. The requirement to test at maximum mercury input level is waived unless the stack test is conducted for mercury. The requirement to test at maximum TSM input level is waived unless the stack test is conducted for TSM.</P>

                <P>(c) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded the emission limit or 75 percent of the emission limit (as specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart) for a pollutant, you <PRTPAGE P="138"/>must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over a consecutive 2-year period meet the required level (at or below 75 percent of the emission limit, as specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart).</P>
                <P>(d) If you are required to meet an applicable tune-up work practice standard, you must conduct an annual, biennial, or 5-year performance tune-up according to § 63.7540(a)(10), (11), or (12), respectively. Each annual tune-up specified in § 63.7540(a)(10) must be no more than 13 months after the previous tune-up. Each biennial tune-up specified in § 63.7540(a)(11) must be conducted no more than 25 months after the previous tune-up. Each 5-year tune-up specified in § 63.7540(a)(12) must be conducted no more than 61 months after the previous tune-up. For a new or reconstructed affected source (as defined in § 63.7490), the first annual, biennial, or 5-year tune-up must be no later than 13 months, 25 months, or 61 months, respectively, after April 1, 2013 or the initial startup of the new or reconstructed affected source, whichever is later.</P>
                <P>(e) If you demonstrate compliance with the mercury, HCl, or TSM based on fuel analysis, you must conduct a monthly fuel analysis according to § 63.7521 for each type of fuel burned that is subject to an emission limit in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart. You may comply with this monthly requirement by completing the fuel analysis any time within the calendar month as long as the analysis is separated from the previous analysis by at least 14 calendar days. If you burn a new type of fuel, you must conduct a fuel analysis before burning the new type of fuel in your boiler or process heater. You must still meet all applicable continuous compliance requirements in § 63.7540. If each of 12 consecutive monthly fuel analyses demonstrates 75 percent or less of the compliance level, you may decrease the fuel analysis frequency to quarterly for that fuel. If any quarterly sample exceeds 75 percent of the compliance level or you begin burning a new type of fuel, you must return to monthly monitoring for that fuel, until 12 months of fuel analyses are again less than 75 percent of the compliance level. If sampling is conducted on one day per month, samples should be no less than 14 days apart, but if multiple samples are taken per month, the 14-day restriction does not apply.</P>
                <P>(f) You must report the results of performance tests and the associated fuel analyses within 60 days after the completion of the performance tests. This report must also verify that the operating limits for each boiler or process heater have not changed or provide documentation of revised operating limits established according to § 63.7530 and Table 7 to this subpart, as applicable. The reports for all subsequent performance tests must include all applicable information required in § 63.7550.</P>
                <P>(g) For affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490) that have not operated since the previous compliance demonstration and more than one year has passed since the previous compliance demonstration, you must complete the subsequent compliance demonstration, if subject to the emission limits in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected source and according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 10 to this subpart. You must complete a subsequent tune-up by following the procedures described in § 63.7540(a)(10)(i) through (vi) and the schedule described in § 63.7540(a)(13) for units that are not operating at the time of their scheduled tune-up.</P>

                <P>(h) If your affected boiler or process heater is in the unit designed to burn light liquid subcategory and you combust ultra-low sulfur liquid fuel, you do not need to conduct further performance tests (stack tests or fuel analyses) if the pollutants measured during the initial compliance performance tests meet the emission limits in Tables 1 or 2 of this subpart providing you demonstrate ongoing compliance with the emissions limits by monitoring and recording the type of fuel combusted on a monthly basis. If you intend to use a fuel other than ultra-low sulfur liquid fuel, natural gas, refinery gas, or other gas 1 fuel, you must conduct new performance tests within 60 days of burning the new fuel type.<PRTPAGE P="139"/>

Following each performance test and until the next performance test, you must comply with the operating limit for operating load conditions specified in Table 4 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(d) You must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must comply with the minimum applicable sampling times or volumes specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(e) To determine compliance with the emission limits, you must use the F-Factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this chapter to convert the measured particulate matter (PM) concentrations, the measured HCl concentrations, the measured mercury concentrations, and the measured TSM concentrations that result from the performance test to pounds per million Btu heat input emission rates.</P>
                <P>(f) Except for a 30-day rolling average based on CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, if measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection level), you must use the method detection level as the measured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating compliance. The measured result for a multiple component analysis (e.g., analytical values for multiple Method 29 fractions both for individual HAP metals and for total HAP metals) may include a combination of method detection level data and analytical data reported above the method detection level.</P>

The CO and oxygen (or CO<E T="52">2</E>) levels shall be monitored at the same location at the outlet of the boiler or process heater. An owner or operator may request an alternative test method under § 63.7 of this chapter, in order that compliance with the CO emissions limit be determined using CO<E T="52">2</E> as a diluent correction in place of oxygen at 3 percent.

                <SUBJECT>How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations, fuel specifications and work practice standards?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limit that applies to you by conducting initial performance tests and fuel analyses and establishing operating limits, as applicable, according to § 63.7520, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and Tables 5 and 7 to this subpart. The requirement to conduct a fuel analysis is not applicable for units that burn a single type of fuel, as specified by § 63.7510(a)(2). If applicable, you must also install, operate, and maintain all applicable CMS (including CEMS, COMS, and CPMS) according to § 63.7525.<PRTPAGE P="155"/>

                <P>(b) If you demonstrate compliance through performance stack testing, you must establish each site-specific operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to you according to the requirements in § 63.7520, Table 7 to this subpart, and paragraph (b)(4) of this section, as applicable. You must also conduct fuel analyses according to § 63.7521 and establish maximum fuel pollutant input levels according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, and as specified in § 63.7510(a)(2). (Note that § 63.7510(a)(2) exempts certain fuels from the fuel analysis requirements.) However, if you switch fuel(s) and cannot show that the new fuel(s) does (do) not increase the chlorine, mercury, or TSM input into the unit through the results of fuel analysis, then you must repeat the performance test to demonstrate compliance while burning the new fuel(s).</P>
                <P>(1) You must establish the maximum chlorine fuel input (Clinput) during the initial fuel analysis according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) You must determine the fuel type or fuel mixture that you could burn in your boiler or process heater that has the highest content of chlorine.</P>
                <P>(ii) During the fuel analysis for hydrogen chloride, you must determine the fraction of the total heat input for each fuel type burned (Qi) based on the fuel mixture that has the highest content of chlorine, and the average chlorine concentration of each fuel type burned (Ci).</P>
                <P>(iii) You must establish a maximum chlorine input level using Equation 7 of this section.</P>

                <P>(4) You must establish parameter operating limits according to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (ix) of this section. As indicated in Table 4 to this subpart, you are not required to establish and comply with the operating parameter limits when you are using a CEMS to monitor and demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit for that control device parameter.</P>
                <P>(i) For a wet acid gas scrubber, you must establish the minimum scrubber effluent pH and liquid flow rate as defined in § 63.7575, as your operating limits during the performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit. If you use a wet scrubber and you conduct separate performance tests for HCl and mercury emissions, you must establish one set of minimum scrubber effluent pH, liquid flow rate, and pressure drop operating limits. The minimum scrubber effluent pH operating limit must be established during the HCl performance test. If you conduct multiple performance tests, you must set the minimum liquid flow rate operating limit at the higher of the minimum values established during the performance tests.</P>

                <P>(ii) For any particulate control device (e.g., ESP, particulate wet scrubber, fabric filter) for which you use a PM CPMS, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="157"/>

                <P>(A) Determine your operating limit as the average PM CPMS output value recorded during the most recent performance test run demonstrating compliance with the filterable PM emission limit or at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of the emission limit if your PM performance test demonstrates compliance below 75 percent of the emission limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).</P>

                <P>(B) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or performance test with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">4</E>) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Zero point data for <E T="03">in-situ</E> instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Zero point data for <E T="03">extractive</E> instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The zero point may also be established by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) If none of the steps in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>) through (<E T="03">iii</E>) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Can I use efficiency credits earned from implementation of energy conservation measures to comply with this subpart?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) If you elect to comply with the alternative equivalent output-based emission limits, instead of the heat input-based limits listed in Table 2 to this subpart, and you want to take credit for implementing energy conservation measures identified in an energy assessment, you may demonstrate compliance using efficiency credits according to the procedures in this section. You may use this compliance approach for an existing affected boiler for demonstrating initial compliance according to § 63.7522(e) and for demonstrating monthly compliance according to § 63.7522(f). Owners or operators using this compliance approach must establish an emissions benchmark, calculate and document the efficiency credits, develop an Implementation Plan, comply with the general reporting requirements, and apply the efficiency credit according to the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. You cannot use this compliance approach for a new or reconstructed affected boiler. Additional guidance from the Department of Energy on efficiency credits is available at: <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/boiler/boilerpg.html.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(b) For each existing affected boiler for which you intend to apply emissions credits, establish a benchmark from which emission reduction credits may be generated by determining the actual annual fuel heat input to the affected boiler before initiation of an energy conservation activity to reduce energy demand (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> fuel usage) according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. The benchmark shall be expressed in trillion Btu per year heat input.</P>
                <P>(1) The benchmark from which efficiency credits may be generated shall be determined by using the most representative, accurate, and reliable process available for the source. The benchmark shall be established for a one-year period before the date that an energy demand reduction occurs, unless it can be demonstrated that a different time period is more representative of historical operations.</P>
                <P>(2) Determine the starting point from which to measure progress. Inventory all fuel purchased and generated on-site (off-gases, residues) in physical units (MMBtu, million cubic feet, etc.).</P>
                <P>(3) Document all uses of energy from the affected boiler. Use the most recent data available.</P>
                <P>(4) Collect non-energy related facility and operational data to normalize, if necessary, the benchmark to current operations, such as building size, operating hours, etc. If possible, use actual data that are current and timely rather than estimated data.</P>

                <P>(c) Efficiency credits can be generated if the energy conservation measures were implemented after January 1, 2008 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits.<PRTPAGE P="163"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) The following emission points cannot be used to generate efficiency credits:</P>
                <P>(i) Energy conservation measures implemented on or before January 1, 2008, unless the level of energy demand reduction is increased after January 1, 2008, in which case credit will be allowed only for change in demand reduction achieved after January 1, 2008.</P>
                <P>(ii) Efficiency credits on shut-down boilers. Boilers that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits unless the facility provides documentation linking the permanent shutdown to energy conservation measures identified in the energy assessment. In this case, the bench established for the affected boiler to which the credits from the shutdown will be applied must be revised to include the benchmark established for the shutdown boiler.</P>
                <P>(2) For all points included in calculating emissions credits, the owner or operator shall:</P>
                <P>(i) Calculate annual credits for all energy demand points. Use Equation 19 to calculate credits. Energy conservation measures that meet the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not be included, except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Credits are generated by the difference between the benchmark that is established for each affected boiler, and the actual energy demand reductions from energy conservation measures implemented after January 1, 2008.

                <P>(6) Procedures for providing an ignition source to mold vents of sand mold systems in each pouring area and pouring station unless you determine the mold vent gases either are not ignitable, ignite automatically, or cannot be ignited due to accessibility or safety issues. You must document and maintain records of this determination. The determination of ignitability, accessibility, and safety may encompass multiple casting patterns provided the castings utilize similar sand-to-metal ratios, binder formulations, and coating materials. The determination of ignitability must be based on observations of the mold vents within 5 minutes of pouring, and the flame must be present for at least 15 seconds for the mold vent to be considered ignited. For the purpose of this determination:</P>
                <P>(i) Mold vents that ignite more than 75 percent of the time without the presence of an auxiliary ignition source are considered to ignite automatically; and</P>

                <P>(ii) Mold vents that do not ignite automatically and cannot be ignited in <PRTPAGE P="231"/>the presence of an auxiliary ignition source more than 25 percent of the time are considered to be not ignitable.</P>

                <P>(4) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation is conducted at a gasoline service station to clean up remediation material from a leaking underground storage tank.</P>
                <P>(5) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation is conducted at a farm or residential site.</P>

                <P>(6) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation is conducted at a research and development facility that meets the requirements under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112(c)(7).<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) Your site remediation activities are not subject to the requirements of this subpart, except for the recordkeeping requirements in this paragraph, provided that you meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You determine that the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart that is contained in the remediation material excavated, extracted, pumped, or otherwise removed during all of the site remediations conducted at your facility is less than 1 megagram (Mg) annually. This exemption applies the 1 Mg limit on a facility-wide, annual basis, and there is no restriction to the number of site remediations that can be conducted during this period.</P>
                <P>(2) You must prepare and maintain at your facility written documentation to support your determination that the total HAP quantity in your remediation materials for the year is less than 1 Mg. The documentation must include a description of your methodology and data used for determining the total HAP content of the remediation material.</P>
                <P>(3) Your Title V permit does not have to be reopened or revised solely to include the recordkeeping requirement specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, the requirement must be included in your permit the next time the permit is renewed, reopened, or revised for another reason.</P>
                <P>(d) Your site remediation is not subject to the requirements of this subpart if all remediation activities at your facility subject to this subpart are completed and you have notified the Administrator in writing that all remediation activities subject to this subpart are completed. You must maintain records of compliance, in accordance with § 63.7953, for each remediation activity that was subject to this subpart. All future remediation activity meeting the applicability criteria in this section must comply with the requirements of this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What site remediation sources at my facility does this subpart affect?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source for your site remediation as designated by paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Process vents.</E> The affected source is the entire group of process vents associated with the in-situ and ex-situ remediation processes used at your site to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, or immobilize hazardous substances in the remediation material subject to remediation. Examples of such in-situ remediation processes include, but are not limited to, soil vapor extraction and bioremediation processes. Examples of such ex-situ remediation processes include but are not limited to, thermal desorption, bioremediation, and air stripping processes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Remediation material management units.</E> Remediation material management unit means a tank, surface impoundment, container, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system, as defined in § 63.7957, and is used at your site to manage remediation material. The affected source is the entire group of remediation material management units used for the site remediations at your site. For the purpose of this subpart, a tank or container that is also equipped with a vent that serves as a process vent, as defined in § 63.7957, is not a remediation material management unit, but instead this unit is considered to be a process vent affected source under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Equipment leaks.</E> The affected source is the entire group of equipment components (pumps, valves, etc.) used to manage remediation materials and meeting both of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If either of these conditions do not apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the affected source for equipment leaks.</P>

                <P>(i) The equipment component contains or contacts remediation material having a concentration of total HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight.<PRTPAGE P="282"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or more during a calendar year in remediation material service, as defined in § 63.7957.</P>
                <P>(b) Each affected source for your site is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source before July 30, 2002.</P>
                <P>(c) Each affected source for your site is new if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July 30, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2.</P>

                <P>(a) For each site remediation with an affected source designated under § 63.7882, you must meet the standards specified in §§ 63.7885 through 63.7955, as applicable to your affected source, unless your site remediation meets the requirements for an exemption under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

                <P>(b) A site remediation that is completed within 30 consecutive calendar days according to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section is not subject to the standards under paragraph (a) of this section. This exemption cannot be used for a <PRTPAGE P="283"/>site remediation involving the staged or intermittent cleanup of remediation material whereby the remediation activities at the site are started, stopped, and then re-started in a series of intervals, with durations less than 30-days per interval, when the time period from the beginning of the first interval to the end of the last interval exceeds 30 days.</P>
                <P>(1) The 30 consecutive calendar day period for a site remediation that qualifies for this exemption is determined according to actions taken by you as defined in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) The first day of the 30-day period is defined as the day on which you initiate any action that removes, destroys, degrades, transforms, immobilizes, or otherwise manages the remediation materials. The following activities, when completed before beginning this initial action, are not counted as part of the 30-day period: Activities to characterize the type and extent of the contamination by collecting and analyzing samples; activities to obtain permits from Federal, State, or local authorities to conduct the site remediation; activities to schedule workers and necessary equipment; and activities to arrange for contractor or third party assistance in performing the site remediation.</P>
                <P>(ii) The last day of the 30-day period is defined as the day on which treatment or disposal of all of the remediation materials generated by the cleanup is completed such that the organic constituents in these materials no longer have a reasonable potential for volatilizing and being released to the atmosphere.</P>
                <P>(iii) If treatment or disposal of the remediation materials is conducted at an off-site facility where the final treatment or disposal of the material cannot, or may not, be completed within the 30-day exemption period, then the shipment of all of the remediation material generated from your cleanup that is transferred to another party, or shipped to another facility, within the 30-day period, must be performed according to the applicable requirements specified in § 63.7936.</P>
                <P>(2) For the purpose of complying with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if you ship or otherwise transfer the remediation material off-site you must include in the applicable shipping documentation, in addition to any notifications and certifications required under § 63.7936, a statement that the shipped material was generated by a site remediation activity subject to the conditions of this exemption. The statement must include the date on which you initiated the site remediation activity generating the shipped remediation materials, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and the date 30 calendar days following your initiation date.</P>
                <P>(3) You must prepare and maintain at your facility written documentation describing the exempted site remediation, and listing the initiation and completion dates for the site remediation.</P>

Determination of the VOHAP concentration is made using the procedures specified in § 63.7943.</P>

                <P>(3) If the process vent is also subject to another subpart under 40 CFR part 61 or 40 CFR part 63, you control emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart from the affected process vent in compliance with the standards <PRTPAGE P="284"/>specified in the applicable subpart. This means you are complying with all applicable emissions limitations and work practice standards under the other subpart (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> you install and operate the required air pollution controls or have implemented the required work practice to reduce HAP emissions to levels specified by the applicable subpart). This provision does not apply to any exemption of the affected source from the emissions limitations and work practice standards allowed by the other applicable subpart.</P>

                <P>(2) You must demonstrate that the process vent stream meets the applicable exemption conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section using the procedures specified in § 63.694(m). You must prepare and maintain documentation at your facility to support your determination of the process vent stream flow rate. This documentation must include identification of each process vent exempted under this paragraph and the test results used to determine the process vent stream flow rate and total HAP concentration, as applicable to the exemption conditions for your process vent. You must perform a new determination of the process vent stream flow rate and total HAP concentration, as applicable to the exemption conditions for your process vent, whenever changes to operation of the unit on which the process vent is used could cause the process vent stream conditions to exceed the maximum limits of the exemption.</P>

                <P>(a) For each remediation material management unit that is part of an affected source designated by § 63.7882, you must select and meet the requirements under one of the options specified in paragraph (b) of this section except for those remediation material management units exempted under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) For each affected remediation material management unit, you must meet one of the options in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You control HAP emissions from the affected remediation material management unit according to the standards specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable to the unit.</P>
                <P>(i) If the remediation material management unit is a tank, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7895 through 63.7898.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the remediation material management unit is a container, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7900 through 63.7903.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the remediation material management unit is a surface impoundment, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7905 through 63.7908.</P>
                <P>(iv) If the remediation material management unit is an oil-water or organic-water separator, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7910 through 63.7913.</P>
                <P>(v) If the remediation material management unit is a transfer system, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7915 through 63.7918.</P>

                <P>(2) You determine that the average total VOHAP concentration, as defined in § 63.7957, of the remediation material managed in the remediation material management unit material is less than 500 ppmw. You must follow the requirements in § 63.7943 to demonstrate that the VOHAP concentration of the remediation material is less than 500 ppmw. Once the VOHAP concentration for a <PRTPAGE P="285"/>remediation material has been determined to be less than 500 ppmw, all remediation material management units downstream from the point of determination managing this material meet the requirements of this paragraph unless a remediation process is used that concentrates all, or part of, the remediation material being managed in the unit such that the VOHAP concentration of the material could increase. Any free product returned to the manufacturing process (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, recovered oil returned to a storage tank at a refinery) is no longer subject to this subpart.</P>

                <P>(3) If the remediation material management unit is also subject to another subpart under 40 CFR part 61 or 40 CFR part 63, you control emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart from the affected remediation material management unit in compliance with the standards specified in the applicable subpart. This means you are complying with all applicable emissions limitations and work practice standards under the other subpart (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> you install and operate the required air pollution controls or have implemented the required work practice to reduce HAP emissions to levels specified by the applicable subpart). This provision does not apply to any exemption of the affected source from the emissions limitations and work practice standards allowed by the other applicable subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) If the remediation material management unit is an open tank or surface impoundment used for a biological treatment process, you meet the requirements as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) You demonstrate that the biological treatment process conducted in the open tank or surface impoundment meets the performance levels specified in either § 63.684(b)(4)(i) or (ii).</P>
                <P>(ii) You monitor the biological treatment process conducted in the open tank or surface impoundment according to the requirements in § 63.684(e)(4).</P>
                <P>(c) A remediation material management unit is exempted from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section if this unit is used for cleanup of radioactive mixed waste, as defined in § 63.7957, that is subject to applicable regulations, directives, and other requirements under the Atomic Energy Act, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, or the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act.</P>
                <P>(d) One or a combination of remediation material management units may be exempted at your discretion from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section provided that the total annual quantity of HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart contained in the remediation material placed in all of the remediation material management units exempted under this paragraph is less than 1 Mg/yr. For each remediation material management unit you select to be exempted under this provision, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You must designate each of the remediation material management units you are selecting to be exempted under this paragraph by either submitting to the Administrator a written notification identifying the exempt units or permanently marking the exempt units at the faculty site. If you choose to prepare and submit a written notification, this notification must include a site plan, process diagram, or other appropriate documentation identifying each of the exempt units. If you choose to permanently mark the exempt units, each exempt unit must be marked in such a manner that it can be readily identified as an exempt unit from the other remediation material management units located at the site.</P>

                <P>(2) You must prepare an initial determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the remediation material placed in the units exempted under this paragraph. This determination is based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart as determined at the point where the remediation material is placed in each exempted unit. You must perform a new determination whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the remediation material placed in the exempted units could cause the total annual HAP content in the remediation material to exceed 1 Mg/yr. You must maintain documentation to support the most recent determination of the total annual HAP quantity. This documentation must include the basis <PRTPAGE P="286"/>and data used for determining the organic HAP content of the remediation material.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I determine the average VOHAP concentration of my remediation material?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) General requirements. You must determine the average total VOHAP concentration of a remediation material using either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or by knowledge as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. These methods may be used to determine the average VOHAP concentration of any material listed in (a)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) A single remediation material stream; or</P>
                <P>(2) Two or more remediation material streams that are combined prior to, or within, a remediation material management unit or treatment process; or</P>
                <P>(3) Remediation material that is combined with one or more non-remediation material streams prior to, or within, a remediation material management unit or treatment process.</P>
                <P>(b) Direct measurement. To determine the average total VOHAP concentration of a remediation material using direct measurement, you must use the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Sampling. Samples of each material stream must be collected from the container, pipeline, or other device used to deliver each material stream prior to entering the remediation material management unit or treatment process in a manner such that volatilization of organics contained in the sample is minimized and an adequately representative sample is collected and maintained for analysis by the selected method.</P>
                <P>(i) The averaging period to be used for determining the average total VOHAP concentration for the material stream on a mass-weighted average basis must be designated and recorded. The averaging period can represent any time interval that you determine is appropriate for the material stream but must not exceed 1 year. For streams that are combined, an averaging period representative for all streams must be selected.</P>
                <P>(ii) No less than four samples must be collected to represent the complete range of HAP compositions and HAP quantities that occur in each material stream during the entire averaging period due to normal variations in the material stream(s). Examples of such normal variations are variation of the HAP concentration within a contamination area.</P>
                <P>(iii) All samples must be collected and handled according to written procedures you prepare and document in a site sampling plan. This plan must describe the procedure by which representative samples of the material stream(s) are collected such that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling plan must be maintained on site in the facility operating records. An example of an acceptable sampling plan includes a plan incorporating sample collection and handling procedures according to the guidance found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846 or Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
                <P>(2) Analysis. Each collected sample must be prepared and analyzed according to either one of the methods listed in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii), or any current EPA Contracts Lab Program method (or future revisions) capable of identifying all the HAP in Table 1 of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(3) Calculations. The average total VOHAP concentration (C<AC T="8"/>) on a mass-weighted basis must be calculated by using the results for all samples analyzed according to paragraph (b)(2) of <PRTPAGE P="318"/>this section and Equation 1 of this section as follows:</P>

                <P>(c) Knowledge of the material. To determine the average total VOHAP concentration of a remediation material using knowledge, you must use the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Documentation must be prepared that presents the information used as the basis for your knowledge of the material stream's average VOHAP concentration. Examples of information that may be used as the basis for knowledge include: material balances for the source(s) generating each material stream; species-specific chemical test data for the material stream from previous testing that are still applicable to the current material stream; test data for material from the contamination area(s) being remediated.</P>
                <P>(2) If test data are used as the basis for knowledge, then you must document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in the determination of the average VOHAP concentration. For example, you may use HAP concentration test data for the material stream that are validated according to Method 301 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A as the basis for knowledge of the material. This information must be provided for each material stream where streams are combined.</P>

                <P>(3) If you use species-specific chemical concentration test data as the basis for knowledge of the material, you may adjust the test data to the corresponding average VOHAP concentration value which would be obtained had the material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (f<E T="52">m305</E>) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(d) In the event that you and us disagree on a determination using knowledge of the average total VOHAP concentration for a remediation material, then the results from a determination of VOHAP concentration using direct measurement by Method 305 in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will be used to determine compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. We may perform or request that you perform this determination using direct measurement.</P>

                <P>(2) Analysis. Any one of the following methods may be used to analyze the samples and compute the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the remediation material:</P>
                <P>(i) Method 25E in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A;</P>
                <P>(ii) Methods described in American Petroleum Institute Bulletin 2517, “Evaporation Loss from External Floating Roof Tanks,”;</P>

                <P>(i) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the total organic or HAP emissions concentration at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.</P>
                <P>(ii) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average total organic or HAP emissions concentration maintained during the performance test. The average total organic or HAP emissions concentration, corrected for dilution as appropriate, is the maximum operating limit for your control device.</P>
                <P>(b) You must maintain the daily (24-hour) average total organic or HAP emissions concentration in the exhaust vent stream of the control device outlet less than or equal to the site-specific operating limit established during the performance test.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 63.7985</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to the requirements in this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You are subject to the requirements in this subpart if you own or operate miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, that meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Are located at or are part of a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions, as defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).</P>
                <P>(2) Manufacture coatings as defined in § 63.8105.</P>
                <P>(3) Process, use, or produce HAP.</P>
                <P>(4) Are not part of an affected source under another subpart of this part 63.</P>
                <P>(b) Miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations include the facilitywide collection of equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section that is used to manufacture coatings as defined in § 63.8105. Miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations also include cleaning operations.</P>
                <P>(1) Process vessels.</P>
                <P>(2) Storage tanks for feedstocks and products.</P>
                <P>(3) Components such as pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems.</P>
                <P>(4) Wastewater tanks and transfer racks.</P>

                <P>(c) If the predominant use of a transfer rack loading arm or storage tank (including storage tanks in series) is associated with miscellaneous coating manufacturing, and the loading arm or storage tank is not part of an affected source under a subpart of this part 63, then you must assign the loading arm or storage tank to the miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations. If the predominant use cannot be determined, and the loading arm or storage tank is not part of an affected source under a subpart of this part 63, then you must assign the loading arm or storage tank to the miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations. If the use varies from year to year, then you must base the determination on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding December 11, 2003 or, if the loading arm or storage tank <PRTPAGE P="335"/>was not in operation during that year, you must base the use on the expected use for the first 5-year period after startup. You must include the determination in the notification of compliance status report specified in § 63.8075(d). You must redetermine the predominant use at least once every 5 years after the compliance date.</P>
                <P>(d) The requirements for miscellaneous coating manufacturing sources in this subpart do not apply to operations described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Research and development facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the CAA.</P>
                <P>(2) The affiliated operations located at an affected source under subparts GG (National Emission Standards for Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework Facilities), KK (National Emission Standards for the Printing and Publishing Industry), JJJJ (NESHAP: Paper and Other Web Coating), future MMMM (National Emission Standards for Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products Surface Coating Operations) and SSSS (NESHAP: Surface Coating of Metal Coil) of 40 CFR part 63. Affiliated operations include, but are not limited to, mixing or dissolving of coating ingredients; coating mixing for viscosity adjustment, color tint or additive blending, or pH adjustment; cleaning of coating lines and coating line parts; handling and storage of coatings and solvent; and conveyance and treatment of wastewater.</P>

                <P>(3) Ancillary equipment such as boilers and incinerators (only those not used to comply with the emission limits in Tables 1 through 5 to this subpart), chillers and refrigeration systems, and other equipment that is not directly involved in the manufacturing of a coating (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> it operates as a closed system, and materials are not combined with materials used to manufacture the coating).</P>
                <P>(4) Quality assurance/quality control laboratories.</P>
                <P>(5) Modifying a purchased coating in preparation for application at the purchasing facility.</P>

You may elect to measure the same parameter(s) that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit(s) and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Continuous emissions monitoring systems.</E> Each continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the requirements in § 63.8 and paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I comply with emissions averaging for stationary process vessels at existing sources?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel, you may elect to comply with emissions averaging for <PRTPAGE P="342"/>stationary process vessels greater than or equal to 250 gallons (gal) at your existing affected source as specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) A State may prohibit averaging of HAP emissions and require the owner or operator of an existing affected source to comply with the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(2) All stationary process vessels in an emissions averaging group must be equipped with a tightly-fitting vented cover.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial compliance.</E> To demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions averaging alternative, you must comply with the provisions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Estimate uncontrolled emissions from each affected stationary process vessel in pounds per batch using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2), except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. For the purposes of this section, uncontrolled emissions means the emissions from the vessel if it were equipped only with a tightly-fitting vented cover. You must identify the range of typical operating parameters and perform the calculation using the values that result in the highest emissions, and you must document the operating parameters and resulting emissions calculations in the precompliance report.</P>
                <P>(i) When you are required to calculate uncontrolled emissions from heating, you may not calculate emissions using Equation 13 of subpart GGG of this part 63.</P>
                <P>(ii) The statement in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(B) that “the partial pressure of HAP shall be assumed to be 25 percent of the saturated value if the purge flow rate is greater than 100 scfm” does not apply. For the purposes of this subpart, multiply the HAP partial pressure in Equation 12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG by a HAP-specific saturation factor determined in accordance with Equations 1 through 3 of this section. Solve equation 1 of this section iteratively beginning with saturation factors (in the right-hand side of the equation) of 1.0 for each condensable compound. Stop iterating when the calculated saturation factors for all compounds are the same to two significant figures for subsequent iterations. Note that for multi-component emission streams, saturation factors must be calculated for all condensable compounds, not just the HAP.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I comply with a weight percent HAP limit in coating products?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel at an existing source, you may elect to comply with a 5 weight percent HAP limit for process vessels at your affected source that are used to manufacture coatings with a HAP content of less than 0.05 kg per kg product as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) You may only comply with the alternative during the production of coatings that contain less than 5 weight percent HAP, as determined using any of the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).</P>
                <P>(2) Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). You may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for the mass fraction of HAP.</P>
                <P>(3) You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.</P>
                <P>(4) You may rely on formulation data from raw material suppliers if it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens, as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. If the HAP weight percent estimated based on formulation data conflicts with the results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, then there is a rebuttal presumption that the test results are accurate unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting authority that the test results are not accurate and that the formulation data are more appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant.</P>
                <P>(b) You are required to obtain a title V permit, whether your affected source is a part of a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions or a part of an area source of HAP emissions. A major source of HAP is a source that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons or more per year. An area source of HAP is a source that has the potential to emit HAP but is not a major source. Nothing in this subpart revises how affected sources are aggregated for purposes of determining whether an affected source is a part of an area, nonmajor, or major source under any provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) or EPA's regulations. For information on aggregating affected sources to determine what is a source under title V, see the definition of major source in 40 CFR 70.2, 71.2 and 63.2.</P>
                <P>(c) Beginning on December 19, 2006, the provisions of subpart E of 40 CFR part 61 that apply to mercury chlor-alkali plants, which are listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, are no longer applicable.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Continuous monitoring option.</E> You must monitor mercury concentration according to § 63.8242(a) at all times that the affected source is operating with the exception of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must monitor mercury emissions continuously (or collect data at all required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</P>
                <P>(2) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels or to fulfill a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Periodic monitoring option.</E> If you choose the periodic monitoring option under § 63.8240(b), you must monitor according to the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) If your final control device is a nonregenerable carbon adsorber, then you must conduct at least three test runs per week meeting the criteria specified in § 63.8232(c)(1) and (2) to measure mercury emissions using the test methods specified in § 63.8232(d). Alternatively, you may use any other method that has been validated using the applicable procedures in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.</P>
                <P>(2) If your final control device is anything other than a nonregenerable carbon adsorber, you must monitor according to the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) You must conduct at least three test runs per week meeting the criteria specified in § 63.8232(c)(1) and (2) to measure mercury emissions using the test methods specified in § 63.8232(d).

                <P>(ii) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, you must continuously collect data at least once every 15 minutes using a CPMS installed and operated according to § 63.8242(b) and record each 1-hour average from all measured data values during each 1-hour period for the applicable parameter identified in § 63.8232(f)(1) using the methods specified in § 63.8244(a).</P>
                <P>(iii) As appropriate, you must continuously monitor the temperature specified in § 63.8232(f)(1)(vii) during each heating phase of the regeneration cycle of your carbon adsorber.</P>

                <P>(iv) If the hourly average monitoring value of any applicable parameter recorded under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is below the minimum monitoring value or above the maximum <PRTPAGE P="369"/>monitoring value of that same parameter established under § 63.8232(f)(2) for 24 consecutive hours, your monitoring value is out of range and you must take corrective action as soon as practicable. The hourly average monitoring value must be above the minimum monitoring value or below the maximum monitoring value as appropriate for that parameter, within 48 hours of the period that the monitoring value is out of range.</P>
                <P>(v) If your final control device is a regenerative carbon adsorber, when the maximum hourly value of the temperature measured according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section is below the reference temperature determined according to § 63.8232(f)(2) for three consecutive regeneration cycles, your monitoring value is out of range and you must take corrective action as soon as practicable. During the first regeneration cycle following the period that your monitoring value is out of range, the maximum hourly value must be above the reference temperature recorded according to § 63.8232(f)(2).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a BSCP manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of, a major source of HAP emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(a) A BSCP manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures brick (including, but not limited to, face brick, structural brick, and brick pavers); clay pipe; roof tile; extruded floor and wall tile; and/or other extruded, dimensional clay products. Brick and structural clay products manufacturing facilities typically process raw clay and shale, form the processed materials into bricks or shapes, and dry and fire the bricks or shapes. A plant site that manufactures refractory products, as defined in § 63.9824, or clay ceramics, as defined in § 63.8665, is not a BSCP manufacturing facility.</P>
                <P>(b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations (including operating limits) in this subpart at all times, except during periods that you are approved for and in compliance with the alternative standard for routine control device maintenance as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and except during periods of start-up and shutdown, at which time you must comply with the applicable work practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart.</P>

                <P>(b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. During the period between the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.8395 and the date upon which continuous monitoring systems (CMS) (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> continuous parameter monitoring systems) have been installed and verified and any applicable operating limits have been set, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the process and emissions control equipment.</P>
                <P>(c) For each affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must prepare and implement a written operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&amp;M) plan according to the requirements in § 63.8425.</P>
                <P>(d) If you own or operate an affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart and must perform routine maintenance on the control device for that kiln, you may bypass the kiln control device and continue operating the kiln subject to the alternative standard established in this paragraph upon approval by the Administrator and provided you satisfy the conditions listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You must request to use the routine control device maintenance alternative standard from the Administrator no later than 120 calendar days before the compliance date specified in § 63.8395. Your request must justify the need for the routine maintenance on the control device and the time required to accomplish the maintenance activities, describe the maintenance activities and the frequency of the maintenance activities, explain why the maintenance cannot be accomplished during kiln shutdowns, provide information stating whether the continued operation of the affected source will result in fewer emissions than shutting the source down while the maintenance is performed, describe how you plan to comply with paragraph (b) of this section during the maintenance, and provide any other documentation required by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(2) The routine control device maintenance must not exceed 4 percent of the annual operating uptime for each kiln.</P>
                <P>(3) The request for the routine control device maintenance alternative standard, if approved by the Administrator, must be incorporated by reference in and attached to the affected source's title V permit.</P>
                <P>(4) You must minimize HAP emissions during the period when the kiln is operating and the control device is offline by complying with the applicable standard in Table 3 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(5) You must minimize the time period during which the kiln is operating and the control device is offline.</P>
                <P>(e) You must be in compliance with the work practice standards in this subpart at all times.</P>

                <P>(f) You must be in compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part, <PRTPAGE P="388"/>except as noted in Table 10 to this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart establishes national emission limitations and work practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from clay ceramics manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standards.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 63.8535</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a clay ceramics manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of a major source of HAP emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) A clay ceramics manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures pressed floor tile, pressed wall tile, other pressed tile, or sanitaryware (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sinks and toilets). Clay ceramics manufacturing facilities typically process clay, shale, and various additives; form the processed materials into tile or sanitaryware shapes; and dry and fire the ceramic products. Glazes are applied to many tile and sanitaryware products. A plant site that manufactures refractory products, as defined in § 63.9824, or brick and structural clay products (BSCP), as defined in § 63.8515, is not a clay ceramics manufacturing facility.</P>
                <P>(b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This subpart applies to each existing, new, or reconstructed affected source at a clay ceramics manufacturing facility.</P>
                <P>(b) Each existing, new, or reconstructed ceramic tile roller kiln, sanitaryware tunnel kiln, sanitaryware shuttle kiln, ceramic tile glaze line using glaze spraying, sanitaryware glaze spray booth, ceramic tile spray dryer, and floor tile press dryer is an affected source.</P>
                <P>(c) Process units not subject to the requirements of this subpart are listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Tunnel, roller or shuttle kilns that are used exclusively for refiring.</P>
                <P>(2) Tunnel, roller or shuttle kilns that are used exclusively for setting glazes on previously fired products.</P>
                <P>(3) Glaze spray operations that are used exclusively with those kilns listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) Process units listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section that are permitted to, but do not, process first-fire ware, until such time as they begin to process first-fire ware.</P>
                <P>(5) Glaze spray operations that on average use wet glazes containing less than 0.1 (weight) percent metal HAP (dry weight basis) per spray booth over an entire calendar year.</P>
                <P>(6) Raw material processing and handling.</P>
                <P>(7) Wall tile press dryers.</P>
                <P>(8) Sanitaryware ware dryers.</P>
                <P>(9) Sources covered by subparts JJJJJ and SSSSS of this part.</P>
                <P>(d) A source is a new affected source if construction of the affected source began after December 18, 2014, and you met the applicability criteria at the time you began construction.</P>
                <P>(e) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as defined in § 63.2.</P>
                <P>(f) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations (including operating limits) in this subpart at all times, except during periods that you are approved for and in compliance with the alternative standard for routine control device maintenance as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and except during periods of start-up and shutdown, at which time you must comply with the applicable work practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart.</P>

                <P>(b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. During the period between the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.8545 and the date upon which continuous monitoring systems (CMS) (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> continuous parameter monitoring systems) have been installed and verified and any applicable operating limits have been set, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the process and emissions control equipment.</P>
                <P>(c) For each affected source that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must prepare and implement a written operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&amp;M) plan according to the requirements in § 63.8575.</P>

                <P>(1) You must request to use the routine control device maintenance alternative standard from the Administrator no later than 120 calendar days before the compliance date specified in § 63.8545. Your request must justify the need for the routine maintenance on the control device and the time required to accomplish the maintenance activities, describe the maintenance activities and the frequency of the maintenance activities, explain why the maintenance cannot be accomplished during source shutdowns, provide information stating whether the continued operation of the affected source will result in fewer emissions than shutting the source down while the maintenance is performed, describe how you plan to comply with paragraph (b) of this section during the maintenance, and provide any other documentation required by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(2) The routine control device maintenance must not exceed 4 percent of the annual operating uptime for each affected source.</P>
                <P>(3) The request for the routine control device maintenance alternative standard, if approved by the Administrator, must be incorporated by reference in and attached to the affected source's title V permit.</P>
                <P>(4) You must minimize HAP emissions during the period when the affected source is operating and the control device is offline by complying with the applicable standard in Table 3 to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(5) You must minimize the time period during which the affected source is operating and the control device is offline.</P>
                <P>(e) If you own or operate an affected kiln that is subject to the work practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart, you must be in compliance with that work practice standard at all times, except during periods of natural gas curtailment or other periods when natural gas is not available.</P>
                <P>(f) You must be in compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part, except as noted in Table 9 to this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an asphalt processing facility or an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility, as defined in § 63.8698, that is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions, or is located at, or is part of a major source of HAP emissions.</P>
                <P>(b) After the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.8683, blowing stills, asphalt storage tanks, saturators, wet loopers, and coaters subject to the provisions of this subpart that are also subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart UU, are required to comply only with provisions of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) This subpart does not apply to any equipment that is subject to subpart CC of this part or to subpart K, Ka, or Kb of 40 CFR part 60.</P>
                <P>(d) This subpart does not apply to asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing equipment used for research and development, as defined in § 63.8698.</P>
                <P>(e) The provisions of subpart J of 40 CFR part 60 do not apply to emissions from asphalt processing facilities subject to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(f) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source at asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities.</P>
                <P>(b) The affected source is:</P>
                <P>(1) Each asphalt processing facility as defined in § 63.8698; or</P>
                <P>(2) Each asphalt roofing manufacturing line as defined in § 63.8698.</P>
                <P>(i) If the asphalt roofing manufacturing line is collocated with an asphalt processing facility, the storage tanks that store asphalt flux intended for oxidation in the blowing stills and those tanks that receive asphalt directly from the on-site blowing stills are part of the asphalt processing facility. The remaining asphalt storage tanks are considered to be part of the asphalt roofing facility.</P>
                <P>(ii) If an asphalt storage tank is shared by two or more lines at an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility, the shared storage tank is considered part of the line to which the tank supplies the greatest amount of asphalt, on an annual basis.</P>
                <P>(iii) If a sealant or adhesive applicator is shared by two or more asphalt roofing manufacturing lines, the shared applicator is considered part of the line that provides the greatest throughput to the applicator, on an annual basis.</P>
                <P>(c) An affected source is a new affected source if you commenced construction of the affected source after November 21, 2001, and you met the applicability criteria at the time you commenced construction.</P>
                <P>(d) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria in the reconstruction definition in § 63.2.</P>
                <P>(e) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>When must I comply with this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source and start up:</P>
                <P>(1) On or before April 29, 2003, then you must comply with the requirements for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart no later than April 29, 2003.</P>
                <P>(2) After April 29, 2003, then you must comply with the requirements for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart upon startup.</P>
                <P>(b) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with the requirements for existing sources no later than May 1, 2006.</P>
                <P>(c) If you have an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a (or part of a) major source of HAP, then the following requirements apply:</P>

                <SUBJECT>What definitions apply to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 40 CFR 63.2, the General Provisions of this part, and in this section as follows:</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Adhesive applicator</E> means the equipment used to apply adhesive to roofing shingles for producing laminated or dimensional roofing shingles.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Asphalt flux</E> means the organic residual material from distillation of crude oil that is generally used in asphalt roofing manufacturing and paving and non-paving asphalt products.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Asphalt loading rack</E> means the equipment at an asphalt processing facility used to transfer oxidized asphalt from a storage tank into a tank truck, rail car, or barge.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Asphalt processing facility</E> means any facility engaged in the preparation of asphalt flux at stand-alone asphalt processing facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt roofing facilities. Asphalt preparation, called “blowing,” is the oxidation of asphalt flux, achieved by bubbling air through the heated asphalt, to raise the softening point and to reduce penetration of the oxidized asphalt. An asphalt processing facility includes one or more asphalt flux blowing stills, asphalt flux storage tanks storing asphalt flux intended for processing in the blowing stills, oxidized asphalt storage tanks, and oxidized asphalt loading racks.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Asphalt roofing manufacturing facility</E> means a facility consisting of one or <PRTPAGE P="461"/>more asphalt roofing manufacturing lines.</P>

                  <E T="03">Asphalt roofing manufacturing line</E> means the collection of equipment used to manufacture asphalt roofing products through a series of sequential process steps. The equipment that comprises an asphalt roofing manufacturing line varies depending on the type of substrate used (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> organic or inorganic) and the final product manufactured (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> roll roofing, laminated shingles). For example, an asphalt roofing manufacturing line that uses fiberglass mat as a substrate typically would not include a saturator/wet looper (or the saturator/wet looper could be bypassed if the line manufacturers multiple types of products). An asphalt roofing manufacturing line can include a saturator (including wet looper), coater, coating mixers, sealant applicators, adhesive applicators, and asphalt storage and process tanks. The number of asphalt roofing manufacturing lines at a particular facility is determined by the number of saturators (or coaters) operated in parallel. For example, an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility with two saturators (or coaters) operating in parallel would be considered to have two separate roofing manufacturing lines.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Asphalt storage tank</E> means any tank used to store asphalt flux, oxidized asphalt, and modified asphalt, at asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt processing facilities.

                  <E T="03">Coater</E> means the equipment used to apply amended (filled or modified) asphalt to the top and bottom of the substrate (typically fiberglass mat) used to manufacture shingles and rolled roofing products.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Coating mixer</E> means the equipment used to mix coating asphalt and a mineral stabilizer, prior to applying the stabilized coating asphalt to the substrate.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Combustion device</E> means an individual unit of equipment such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler used for the combustion of organic hazardous air pollutant vapors.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What methods must I use to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation for loop slitter adhesive use?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Determine the HAP content for each material used.</E> To determine the HAP content for each material used in your foam fabrication operations, you must use one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. If you use the option in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, you are subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).</E> You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when determining HAP content by Method 311.</P>
                <P>(i) Include in the HAP total each HAP that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not need to include it in the HAP total. Express the mass fraction of each HAP you measure as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).</P>
                <P>(ii) Calculate the total HAP content in the test material by adding up the individual HAP contents and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternative method.</E> You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.</E> You may <PRTPAGE P="477"/>rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section to determine the mass fraction of HAP according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. This information may include, but is not limited to, a material safety data sheet (MSDS), a certified product data sheet (CPDS), or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet.</P>
                <P>(i) Include in the HAP total each HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to include it in the HAP total.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the HAP content is provided by the material supplier or manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range for determining compliance.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Verification of supplier or manufacturer information.</E> Although you are not required to perform testing to verify the information obtained according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Administrator may require a separate measurement of the total HAP content using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. If this measurement exceeds the total HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured HAP content to determine compliance.</P>
