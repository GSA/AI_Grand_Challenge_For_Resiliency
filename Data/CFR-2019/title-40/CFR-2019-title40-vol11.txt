      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 63.1
              Applicability.
              (a) General. (1) Terms used throughout this part are defined in § 63.2 or in the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990, except that individual subparts of this part may include specific definitions in addition to or that supersede definitions in § 63.2.
              (2) This part contains national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) established pursuant to section 112 of the Act as amended November 15, 1990. These standards regulate specific categories of stationary sources that emit (or have the potential to emit) one or more hazardous air pollutants listed in this part pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act. This section explains the applicability of such standards to sources affected by them. The standards in this part are independent of NESHAP contained in 40 CFR part 61. The NESHAP in part 61 promulgated by signature of the Administrator before November 15, 1990 (i.e., the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) remain in effect until they are amended, if appropriate, and added to this part.
              (3) No emission standard or other requirement established under this part shall be interpreted, construed, or applied to diminish or replace the requirements of a more stringent emission limitation or other applicable requirement established by the Administrator pursuant to other authority of the Act (section 111, part C or D or any other authority of this Act), or a standard issued under State authority. The Administrator may specify in a specific standard under this part that facilities subject to other provisions under the Act need only comply with the provisions of that standard.
              (4)(i) Each relevant standard in this part 63 must identify explicitly whether each provision in this subpart A is or is not included in such relevant standard.
              (ii) If a relevant part 63 standard incorporates the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, part 61 or other part 63 standards, the relevant part 63 standard must identify explicitly the applicability of each corresponding part 60, part 61, or other part 63 subpart A (General) provision.

              (iii) The General Provisions in this subpart A do not apply to regulations developed pursuant to section 112(r) of the amended Act, unless otherwise specified in those regulations.
              
              (5) [Reserved]
              (6) To obtain the most current list of categories of sources to be regulated under section 112 of the Act, or to obtain the most recent regulation promulgation schedule established pursuant to section 112(e) of the Act, contact the Office of the Director, Emission Standards Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. EPA (MD-13), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711.
              (7)-(9) [Reserved]
              (10) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word “calendar” is absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
              (11) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a notification, application, test plan, report, or other written communication to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.
              (12) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
              (b) Initial applicability determination for this part. (1) The provisions of this part apply to the owner or operator of any stationary source that—
              (i) Emits or has the potential to emit any hazardous air pollutant listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act; and
              (ii) Is subject to any standard, limitation, prohibition, or other federally enforceable requirement established pursuant to this part.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3) An owner or operator of a stationary source who is in the relevant source category and who determines that the source is not subject to a relevant standard or other requirement established under this part must keep a record as specified in § 63.10(b)(3).
              (c) Applicability of this part after a relevant standard has been set under this part. (1) If a relevant standard has been established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source must comply with the provisions of that standard and of this subpart as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
              (2) Except as provided in § 63.10(b)(3), if a relevant standard has been established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source may be required to obtain a title V permit from a permitting authority in the State in which the source is located. Emission standards promulgated in this part for area sources pursuant to section 112(c)(3) of the Act will specify whether—
              (i) States will have the option to exclude area sources affected by that standard from the requirement to obtain a title V permit (i.e., the standard will exempt the category of area sources altogether from the permitting requirement);
              (ii) States will have the option to defer permitting of area sources in that category until the Administrator takes rulemaking action to determine applicability of the permitting requirements; or

              (iii) If a standard fails to specify what the permitting requirements will be for area sources affected by such a standard, then area sources that are subject to the standard will be subject to the requirement to obtain a title V permit without any deferral.
              (3)-(4) [Reserved]
              (5) If an area source that otherwise would be subject to an emission standard or other requirement established under this part if it were a major source subsequently increases its emissions of hazardous air pollutants (or its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants) such that the source is a major source that is subject to the emission standard or other requirement, such source also shall be subject to the notification requirements of this subpart.
              (d) [Reserved]
              (e) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act that is applicable to a source subject to an emission limitation by permit established under section 112(j) of the Act, and the requirements under the section 112(j) emission limitation are substantially as effective as the promulgated emission standard, the owner or operator may request the permitting authority to revise the source's title V permit to reflect that the emission limitation in the permit satisfies the requirements of the promulgated emission standard. The process by which the permitting authority determines whether the section 112(j) emission limitation is substantially as effective as the promulgated emission standard must include, consistent with part 70 or 71 of this chapter, the opportunity for full public, EPA, and affected State review (including the opportunity for EPA's objection) prior to the permit revision being finalized. A negative determination by the permitting authority constitutes final action for purposes of review and appeal under the applicable title V operating permit program.
              [59 FR 12430, Mar. 16, 1994, as amended at 67 FR 16595, Apr. 5, 2002]
               
            
            
              § 63.2
              Definitions.
              The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows:
              
                Act means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., as amended by Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399).
              
                Actual emissions is defined in subpart D of this part for the purpose of granting a compliance extension for an early reduction of hazardous air pollutants.
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or his or her authorized representative (e.g., a State that has been delegated the authority to implement the provisions of this part).
              
                Affected source, for the purposes of this part, means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is included in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory for which a section 112(d) standard or other relevant standard is established pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Each relevant standard will define the “affected source,” as defined in this paragraph unless a different definition is warranted based on a published justification as to why this definition would result in significant administrative, practical, or implementation problems and why the different definition would resolve those problems. The term “affected source,” as used in this part, is separate and distinct from any other use of that term in EPA regulations such as those implementing title IV of the Act. Affected source may be defined differently for part 63 than affected facility and stationary source in parts 60 and 61, respectively. This definition of “affected source,” and the procedures for adopting an alternative definition of “affected source,” shall apply to each section 112(d) standard for which the initial proposed rule is signed by the Administrator after June 30, 2002.
              
                Alternative emission limitation means conditions established pursuant to sections 112(i)(5) or 112(i)(6) of the Act by the Administrator or by a State with an approved permit program.
              
                Alternative emission standard means an alternative means of emission limitation that, after notice and opportunity for public comment, has been demonstrated by an owner or operator to the Administrator's satisfaction to achieve a reduction in emissions of any air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of such pollutant achieved under a relevant design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standard, or combination thereof, established under this part pursuant to section 112(h) of the Act.
              
                Alternative test method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that is not a test method in this chapter and that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, using Method 301 in appendix A of this part, to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination that it may be used in place of a test method specified in this part.
              
                Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
              
                Area source means any stationary source of hazardous air pollutants that is not a major source as defined in this part.
              
                Commenced means, with respect to construction or reconstruction of an affected source, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or reconstruction or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or reconstruction.
              
                Compliance date means the date by which an affected source is required to be in compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) pursuant to section 112 of the Act.
              
                Compliance schedule means: (1) In the case of an affected source that is in compliance with all applicable requirements established under this part, a statement that the source will continue to comply with such requirements; or
              (2) In the case of an affected source that is required to comply with applicable requirements by a future date, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis and, if required by an applicable requirement, a detailed schedule of the dates by which each step toward compliance will be reached; or
              (3) In the case of an affected source not in compliance with all applicable requirements established under this part, a schedule of remedial measures, including an enforceable sequence of actions or operations with milestones and a schedule for the submission of certified progress reports, where applicable, leading to compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for which the affected source is not in compliance. This compliance schedule shall resemble and be at least as stringent as that contained in any judicial consent decree or administrative order to which the source is subject. Any such schedule of compliance shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is based.
              
                Construction means the on-site fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected source. Construction does not include the removal of all equipment comprising an affected source from an existing location and reinstallation of such equipment at a new location. The owner or operator of an existing affected source that is relocated may elect not to reinstall minor ancillary equipment including, but not limited to, piping, ductwork, and valves. However, removal and reinstallation of an affected source will be construed as reconstruction if it satisfies the criteria for reconstruction as defined in this section. The costs of replacing minor ancillary equipment must be considered in determining whether the existing affected source is reconstructed.
              
                Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of emissions.
              
                Continuous monitoring system (CMS) is a comprehensive term that may include, but is not limited to, continuous emission monitoring systems, continuous opacity monitoring systems, continuous parameter monitoring systems, or other manual or automatic monitoring that is used for demonstrating compliance with an applicable regulation on a continuous basis as defined by the regulation.
              
                Continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) means a continuous monitoring system that measures the opacity of emissions.
              
                Continuous parameter monitoring system means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of process or control system parameters.
              
                Effective date means:

              (1) With regard to an emission standard established under this part, the date of promulgation in the Federal Register of such standard; or
              (2) With regard to an alternative emission limitation or equivalent emission limitation determined by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program), the date that the alternative emission limitation or equivalent emission limitation becomes effective according to the provisions of this part.
              
                Emission standard means a national standard, limitation, prohibition, or other regulation promulgated in a subpart of this part pursuant to sections 112(d), 112(h), or 112(f) of the Act.
              
                Emissions averaging is a way to comply with the emission limitations specified in a relevant standard, whereby an affected source, if allowed under a subpart of this part, may create emission credits by reducing emissions from specific points to a level below that required by the relevant standard, and those credits are used to offset emissions from points that are not controlled to the level required by the relevant standard.
              
                EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
              
                Equivalent emission limitation means any maximum achievable control technology emission limitation or requirements which are applicable to a major source of hazardous air pollutants and are adopted by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to section 112(g) or (j) of the Act.
              
                Excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report is a report that must be submitted periodically by an affected source in order to provide data on its compliance with relevant emission limits, operating parameters, and the performance of its continuous parameter monitoring systems.
              
                Existing source means any affected source that is not a new source.
              
                Federally enforceable means all limitations and conditions that are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act or that are enforceable under other statutes administered by the Administrator. Examples of federally enforceable limitations and conditions include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Emission standards, alternative emission standards, alternative emission limitations, and equivalent emission limitations established pursuant to section 112 of the Act as amended in 1990;
              (2) New source performance standards established pursuant to section 111 of the Act, and emission standards established pursuant to section 112 of the Act before it was amended in 1990;
              (3) All terms and conditions in a title V permit, including any provisions that limit a source's potential to emit, unless expressly designated as not federally enforceable;
              (4) Limitations and conditions that are part of an approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) or a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP);
              (5) Limitations and conditions that are part of a Federal construction permit issued under 40 CFR 52.21 or any construction permit issued under regulations approved by the EPA in accordance with 40 CFR part 51;
              (6) Limitations and conditions that are part of an operating permit where the permit and the permitting program pursuant to which it was issued meet all of the following criteria:
              (i) The operating permit program has been submitted to and approved by EPA into a State implementation plan (SIP) under section 110 of the CAA;

              (ii) The SIP imposes a legal obligation that operating permit holders adhere to the terms and limitations of such permits and provides that permits which do not conform to the operating permit program requirements and the requirements of EPA's underlying regulations may be deemed not “federally enforceable” by EPA;
              (iii) The operating permit program requires that all emission limitations, controls, and other requirements imposed by such permits will be at least as stringent as any other applicable limitations and requirements contained in the SIP or enforceable under the SIP, and that the program may not issue permits that waive, or make less stringent, any limitations or requirements contained in or issued pursuant to the SIP, or that are otherwise “federally enforceable”;
              (iv) The limitations, controls, and requirements in the permit in question are permanent, quantifiable, and otherwise enforceable as a practical matter; and
              (v) The permit in question was issued only after adequate and timely notice and opportunity for comment for EPA and the public.
              (7) Limitations and conditions in a State rule or program that has been approved by the EPA under subpart E of this part for the purposes of implementing and enforcing section 112; and
              (8) Individual consent agreements that the EPA has legal authority to create.
              
                Fixed capital cost means the capital needed to provide all the depreciable components of an existing source.
              
                Force majeure means, for purposes of § 63.7, an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility.
              
                Fugitive emissions means those emissions from a stationary source that could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening. Under section 112 of the Act, all fugitive emissions are to be considered in determining whether a stationary source is a major source.
              
                Hazardous air pollutant means any air pollutant listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.
              
                Issuance of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a title V permit occurs immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit.
              
                Major source means any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants, unless the Administrator establishes a lesser quantity, or in the case of radionuclides, different criteria from those specified in this sentence.
              
                Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
              
                Monitoring means the collection and use of measurement data or other information to control the operation of a process or pollution control device or to verify a work practice standard relative to assuring compliance with applicable requirements. Monitoring is composed of four elements:

              (1) Indicator(s) of performance—the parameter or parameters you measure or observe for demonstrating proper operation of the pollution control measures or compliance with the applicable emissions limitation or standard. Indicators of performance may include direct or predicted emissions measurements (including opacity), operational parametric values that correspond to process or control device (and capture system) efficiencies or emissions rates, and recorded findings of inspection of work practice activities, materials tracking, or design characteristics. Indicators may be expressed as a single maximum or minimum value, a function of process variables (for example, within a range of pressure drops), a particular operational or work practice status (for example, a damper position, completion of a waste recovery task, materials tracking), or an interdependency between two or among more than two variables.
              (2) Measurement techniques—the means by which you gather and record information of or about the indicators of performance. The components of the measurement technique include the detector type, location and installation specifications, inspection procedures, and quality assurance and quality control measures. Examples of measurement techniques include continuous emission monitoring systems, continuous opacity monitoring systems, continuous parametric monitoring systems, and manual inspections that include making records of process conditions or work practices.
              (3) Monitoring frequency—the number of times you obtain and record monitoring data over a specified time interval. Examples of monitoring frequencies include at least four points equally spaced for each hour for continuous emissions or parametric monitoring systems, at least every 10 seconds for continuous opacity monitoring systems, and at least once per operating day (or week, month, etc.) for work practice or design inspections.
              (4) Averaging time—the period over which you average and use data to verify proper operation of the pollution control approach or compliance with the emissions limitation or standard. Examples of averaging time include a 3-hour average in units of the emissions limitation, a 30-day rolling average emissions value, a daily average of a control device operational parametric range, and an instantaneous alarm.
              
                New affected source means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is included in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory that is subject to a section 112(d) or other relevant standard for new sources. This definition of “new affected source,” and the criteria to be utilized in implementing it, shall apply to each section 112(d) standard for which the initial proposed rule is signed by the Administrator after June 30, 2002. Each relevant standard will define the term “new affected source,” which will be the same as the “affected source” unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:
              (1) Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;
              (2) Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;
              (3) Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;
              (4) Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;
              (5) Incentives for pollution prevention;
              (6) Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);
              (7) Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and
              (8) Other relevant factors.
              
                New source means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after the Administrator first proposes a relevant emission standard under this part establishing an emission standard applicable to such source.
              
                One-hour period, unless otherwise defined in an applicable subpart, means any 60-minute period commencing on the hour.
              
                Opacity means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background. For continuous opacity monitoring systems, opacity means the fraction of incident light that is attenuated by an optical medium.
              
                Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a stationary source.
              
                Performance audit means a procedure to analyze blind samples, the content of which is known by the Administrator, simultaneously with the analysis of performance test samples in order to provide a measure of test data quality.
              
                Performance evaluation means the conduct of relative accuracy testing, calibration error testing, and other measurements used in validating the continuous monitoring system data.
              
                Performance test means the collection of data resulting from the execution of a test method (usually three emission test runs) used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant emission standard as specified in the performance test section of the relevant standard.
              
                Permit modification means a change to a title V permit as defined in regulations codified in this chapter to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
              
                Permit program means a comprehensive State operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in this chapter.
              
                Permit revision means any permit modification or administrative permit amendment to a title V permit as defined in regulations codified in this chapter to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
              
                Permitting authority means: (1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under part 70 of this chapter; or
              (2) The Administrator, in the case of EPA-implemented permit programs under title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
              
                Pollution Prevention means source reduction as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13101-13109). The definition is as follows:
              (1) Source reduction is any practice that:
              (i) Reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and
              (ii) Reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants.
              (2) The term source reduction includes equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control.
              (3) The term source reduction does not include any practice that alters the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a process or activity which itself is not integral to and necessary for the production of a product or the providing of a service.
              
                Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable.
              
                Reconstruction, unless otherwise defined in a relevant standard, means the replacement of components of an affected or a previously nonaffected source to such an extent that:
              (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new source; and

              (2) It is technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source to meet the relevant standard(s) established by the Administrator (or a State) pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Upon reconstruction, an affected source, or a stationary source that becomes an affected source, is subject to relevant standards for new sources, including compliance dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of hazardous air pollutants from that source.
              
              
                Regulation promulgation schedule means the schedule for the promulgation of emission standards under this part, established by the Administrator pursuant to section 112(e) of the Act and published in the Federal Register.
              
              
                Relevant standard means:
              (1) An emission standard;
              (2) An alternative emission standard;
              (3) An alternative emission limitation; or
              (4) An equivalent emission limitation established pursuant to section 112 of the Act that applies to the collection of equipment, activities, or both regulated by such standard or limitation. A relevant standard may include or consist of a design, equipment, work practice, or operational requirement, or other measure, process, method, system, or technique (including prohibition of emissions) that the Administrator (or a State) establishes for new or existing sources to which such standard or limitation applies. Every relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act includes subpart A of this part, as provided by § 63.1(a)(4), and all applicable appendices of this part or of other parts of this chapter that are referenced in that standard.
              
                Responsible official means one of the following:
              (1) For a corporation: A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation, or a duly authorized representative of such person if the representative is responsible for the overall operation of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities and either:
              (i) The facilities employ more than 250 persons or have gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second quarter 1980 dollars); or
              (ii) The delegation of authority to such representative is approved in advance by the Administrator.
              (2) For a partnership or sole proprietorship: a general partner or the proprietor, respectively.
              (3) For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency: either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. For the purposes of this part, a principal executive officer of a Federal agency includes the chief executive officer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., a Regional Administrator of the EPA).
              (4) For affected sources (as defined in this part) applying for or subject to a title V permit: “responsible official” shall have the same meaning as defined in part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever is applicable.

              § 63.4
              Prohibited activities and circumvention.
              (a) Prohibited activities. (1) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part must operate any affected source in violation of the requirements of this part. Affected sources subject to and in compliance with either an extension of compliance or an exemption from compliance are not in violation of the requirements of this part. An extension of compliance can be granted by the Administrator under this part; by a State with an approved permit program; or by the President under section 112(i)(4) of the Act.
              (2) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall fail to keep records, notify, report, or revise reports as required under this part.
              (3)-(5) [Reserved]
              (b) Circumvention. No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall build, erect, install, or use any article, machine, equipment, or process to conceal an emission that would otherwise constitute noncompliance with a relevant standard. Such concealment includes, but is not limited to—
              (1) The use of diluents to achieve compliance with a relevant standard based on the concentration of a pollutant in the effluent discharged to the atmosphere;
              (2) The use of gaseous diluents to achieve compliance with a relevant standard for visible emissions; and
              (c) Fragmentation. Fragmentation after November 15, 1990 which divides ownership of an operation, within the same facility among various owners where there is no real change in control, will not affect applicability. The owner and operator must not use fragmentation or phasing of reconstruction activities (i.e., intentionally dividing reconstruction into multiple parts for purposes of avoiding new source requirements) to avoid becoming subject to new source requirements.

              § 63.5
              Preconstruction review and notification requirements.
              (a) Applicability. (1) This section implements the preconstruction review requirements of section 112(i)(1). After the effective date of a relevant standard, promulgated pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h) of the Act, under this part, the preconstruction review requirements in this section apply to the owner or operator of new affected sources and reconstructed affected sources that are major-emitting as specified in this section. New and reconstructed affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction before the effective date of a relevant standard are not subject to the preconstruction review requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (d), and (e) of this section.
              (2) This section includes notification requirements for new affected sources and reconstructed affected sources that are not major-emitting affected sources and that are or become subject to a relevant promulgated emission standard after the effective date of a relevant standard promulgated under this part.
              (b) Requirements for existing, newly constructed, and reconstructed sources. (1) A new affected source for which construction commences after proposal of a relevant standard is subject to relevant standards for new affected sources, including compliance dates. An affected source for which reconstruction commences after proposal of a relevant standard is subject to relevant standards for new sources, including compliance dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of hazardous air pollutants from that source.
              (2) [Reserved]

              (3) After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by the Administrator under this part, no person may, without obtaining written approval in advance from the Administrator in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, do any of the following:
              
              (i) Construct a new affected source that is major-emitting and subject to such standard;
              (ii) Reconstruct an affected source that is major-emitting and subject to such standard; or
              (iii) Reconstruct a major source such that the source becomes an affected source that is major-emitting and subject to the standard.
              (4) After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by the Administrator under this part, an owner or operator who constructs a new affected source that is not major-emitting or reconstructs an affected source that is not major-emitting that is subject to such standard, or reconstructs a source such that the source becomes an affected source subject to the standard, must notify the Administrator of the intended construction or reconstruction. The notification must be submitted in accordance with the procedures in § 63.9(b).
              (5) [Reserved]
              (6) After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by the Administrator under this part, equipment added (or a process change) to an affected source that is within the scope of the definition of affected source under the relevant standard must be considered part of the affected source and subject to all provisions of the relevant standard established for that affected source.
              (c) [Reserved]
              (d) Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. The provisions of this paragraph implement section 112(i)(1) of the Act.
              (1) General application requirements. (i) An owner or operator who is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section must submit to the Administrator an application for approval of the construction or reconstruction. The application must be submitted as soon as practicable before actual construction or reconstruction begins. The application for approval of construction or reconstruction may be used to fulfill the initial notification requirements of § 63.9(b)(5). The owner or operator may submit the application for approval well in advance of the date actual construction or reconstruction begins in order to ensure a timely review by the Administrator and that the planned date to begin will not be delayed.
              (ii) A separate application shall be submitted for each construction or reconstruction. Each application for approval of construction or reconstruction shall include at a minimum:
              (A) The applicant's name and address;
              (B) A notification of intention to construct a new major affected source or make any physical or operational change to a major affected source that may meet or has been determined to meet the criteria for a reconstruction, as defined in § 63.2 or in the relevant standard;
              (C) The address (i.e., physical location) or proposed address of the source;
              (D) An identification of the relevant standard that is the basis of the application;
              (E) The expected date of the beginning of actual construction or reconstruction;
              (F) The expected completion date of the construction or reconstruction;
              (G) [Reserved]
              (H) The type and quantity of hazardous air pollutants emitted by the source, reported in units and averaging times and in accordance with the test methods specified in the relevant standard, or if actual emissions data are not yet available, an estimate of the type and quantity of hazardous air pollutants expected to be emitted by the source reported in units and averaging times specified in the relevant standard. The owner or operator may submit percent reduction information if a relevant standard is established in terms of percent reduction. However, operating parameters, such as flow rate, shall be included in the submission to the extent that they demonstrate performance and compliance; and
              (I) [Reserved]
              (J) Other information as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.

              (iii) An owner or operator who submits estimates or preliminary information in place of the actual emissions data and analysis required in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(H) and (d)(2) of this section shall submit the actual, measured emissions data and other correct information as soon as available but no later than with the notification of compliance status required in § 63.9(h) (see § 63.9(h)(5)).
              (2) Application for approval of construction. Each application for approval of construction must include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, technical information describing the proposed nature, size, design, operating design capacity, and method of operation of the source, including an identification of each type of emission point for each type of hazardous air pollutant that is emitted (or could reasonably be anticipated to be emitted) and a description of the planned air pollution control system (equipment or method) for each emission point. The description of the equipment to be used for the control of emissions must include each control device for each hazardous air pollutant and the estimated control efficiency (percent) for each control device. The description of the method to be used for the control of emissions must include an estimated control efficiency (percent) for that method. Such technical information must include calculations of emission estimates in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the validity of the calculations.
              (3) Application for approval of reconstruction. Each application for approval of reconstruction shall include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section—
              (i) A brief description of the affected source and the components that are to be replaced;
              (ii) A description of present and proposed emission control systems (i.e., equipment or methods). The description of the equipment to be used for the control of emissions shall include each control device for each hazardous air pollutant and the estimated control efficiency (percent) for each control device. The description of the method to be used for the control of emissions shall include an estimated control efficiency (percent) for that method. Such technical information shall include calculations of emission estimates in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the validity of the calculations;
              (iii) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of constructing a comparable entirely new source;
              (iv) The estimated life of the affected source after the replacements; and
              (v) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the source may have in complying with relevant standards or other requirements after the proposed replacements. The discussion shall be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the technical or economic limitations affect the source's ability to comply with the relevant standard and how they do so.
              (vi) If in the application for approval of reconstruction the owner or operator designates the affected source as a reconstructed source and declares that there are no economic or technical limitations to prevent the source from complying with all relevant standards or other requirements, the owner or operator need not submit the information required in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) through (d)(3)(v) of this section.
              (4) Additional information. The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of an application for approval of construction or reconstruction.
              (e) Approval of construction or reconstruction. (1)(i) If the Administrator determines that, if properly constructed, or reconstructed, and operated, a new or existing source for which an application under paragraph (d) of this section was submitted will not cause emissions in violation of the relevant standard(s) and any other federally enforceable requirements, the Administrator will approve the construction or reconstruction.
              (ii) In addition, in the case of reconstruction, the Administrator's determination under this paragraph will be based on:
              (A) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new source;

              (B) The estimated life of the source after the replacements compared to the life of a comparable entirely new source;
              (C) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or contribute to the emissions from the source; and
              (D) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with relevant standards that are inherent in the proposed replacements.
              (2)(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of construction or reconstruction within 60 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate an application submitted under paragraph (d) of this section. The 60-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.
              (ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
              (3) Before denying any application for approval of construction or reconstruction, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial together with—
              (i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (ii) Notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
              (4) A final determination to deny any application for approval will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 60 calendar days of presentation of additional information or arguments (if the application is complete), or within 60 calendar days after the final date specified for presentation if no presentation is made.
              (5) Neither the submission of an application for approval nor the Administrator's approval of construction or reconstruction shall—
              (i) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
              (ii) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
              (f) Approval of construction or reconstruction based on prior State preconstruction review. (1) Preconstruction review procedures that a State utilizes for other purposes may also be utilized for purposes of this section if the procedures are substantially equivalent to those specified in this section.

              (i) The owner or operator of the new affected source or reconstructed affected source has undergone a preconstruction review and approval process in the State in which the source is (or would be) located and has received a federally enforceable construction permit that contains a finding that the source will meet the relevant promulgated emission standard, if the source is properly built and operated.
              (ii) Provide a statement from the State or other evidence (such as State regulations) that it considered the factors specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

              (2) The owner or operator must submit to the Administrator the request for approval of construction or reconstruction under this paragraph (f)(2) no later than the application deadline specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (see also § 63.9(b)(2)). The owner or operator must include in the request information sufficient for the Administrator's determination. The Administrator will evaluate the owner or operator's request in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a request for approval of construction or reconstruction under this paragraph (f)(2).

              (ii) The President has granted an exemption from compliance with any relevant standard in accordance with section 112(i)(4) of the Act.
              (2) If an area source that otherwise would be subject to an emission standard or other requirement established under this part if it were a major source subsequently increases its emissions of hazardous air pollutants (or its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants) such that the source is a major source, such source shall be subject to the relevant emission standard or other requirement.
              (b) Compliance dates for new and reconstructed sources. (1) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source for which construction or reconstruction commences after proposal of a relevant standard that has an initial startup before the effective date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h) of the Act must comply with such standard not later than the standard's effective date.
              (2) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source that has an initial startup after the effective date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h) of the Act must comply with such standard upon startup of the source.
              (3) The owner or operator of an affected source for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d), 112(f), or 112(h) of the Act but before the effective date (that is, promulgation) of such standard shall comply with the relevant emission standard not later than the date 3 years after the effective date if:
              (i) The promulgated standard (that is, the relevant standard) is more stringent than the proposed standard; for purposes of this paragraph, a finding that controls or compliance methods are “more stringent” must include control technologies or performance criteria and compliance or compliance assurance methods that are different but are substantially equivalent to those required by the promulgated rule, as determined by the Administrator (or his or her authorized representative); and
              (ii) The owner or operator complies with the standard as proposed during the 3-year period immediately after the effective date.

              (4) The owner or operator of an affected source for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act but before the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(f) shall not be required to comply with the section 112(f) emission standard until the date 10 years after the date construction or reconstruction is commenced, except that, if the section 112(f) standard is promulgated more than 10 years after construction or reconstruction is commenced, the owner or operator must comply with the standard as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (5) The owner or operator of a new source that is subject to the compliance requirements of paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section must notify the Administrator in accordance with § 63.9(d)
              (6) [Reserved]
              (7) When an area source becomes a major source by the addition of equipment or operations that meet the definition of new affected source in the relevant standard, the portion of the existing facility that is a new affected source must comply with all requirements of that standard applicable to new sources. The source owner or operator must comply with the relevant standard upon startup.
              (c) Compliance dates for existing sources. (1) After the effective date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act, the owner or operator of an existing source shall comply with such standard by the compliance date established by the Administrator in the applicable subpart(s) of this part. Except as otherwise provided for in section 112 of the Act, in no case will the compliance date established for an existing source in an applicable subpart of this part exceed 3 years after the effective date of such standard.
              (2) If an existing source is subject to a standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, the owner or operator must comply with the standard by the date 90 days after the standard's effective date, or by the date specified in an extension granted to the source by the Administrator under paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section, whichever is later.
              (3)-(4) [Reserved]
              (5) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the owner or operator of an area source that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) hazardous air pollutants such that the source becomes a major source shall be subject to relevant standards for existing sources. Such sources must comply by the date specified in the standards for existing area sources that become major sources. If no such compliance date is specified in the standards, the source shall have a period of time to comply with the relevant emission standard that is equivalent to the compliance period specified in the relevant standard for existing sources in existence at the time the standard becomes effective.
              (d) [Reserved]
              (e) Operation and maintenance requirements. (1)(i) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. During a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, this general duty to minimize emissions requires that the owner or operator reduce emissions from the affected source to the greatest extent which is consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

              (ii) Malfunctions must be corrected as soon as practicable after their occurrence. To the extent that an unexpected event arises during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction, an owner or operator must comply by minimizing emissions during such a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices.
              
              (iii) Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. (i) The owner or operator of an affected source must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction; and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process, air pollution control, and monitoring equipment used to comply with the relevant standard. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan does not need to address any scenario that would not cause the source to exceed an applicable emission limitation in the relevant standard. This plan must be developed by the owner or operator by the source's compliance date for that relevant standard. The purpose of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is to—
              (A) Ensure that, at all times, the owner or operator operates and maintains each affected source, including associated air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner which satisfies the general duty to minimize emissions established by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section;
              (B) Ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practicable after their occurrence in order to minimize excess emissions of hazardous air pollutants; and
              (C) Reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (iii) When actions taken by the owner or operator during a startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator must keep records for that event which demonstrate that the procedures specified in the plan were followed. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other effective form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and describes the actions taken for that event. In addition, the owner or operator must keep records of these events as specified in paragraph 63.10(b), including records of the occurrence and duration of each startup or shutdown (if the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction of operation and each malfunction of the air pollution control and monitoring equipment. Furthermore, the owner or operator shall confirm that actions taken during the relevant reporting period during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction were consistent with the affected source's startup, shutdown and malfunction plan in the semiannual (or more frequent) startup, shutdown, and malfunction report required in § 63.10(d)(5).
              (iv) If an action taken by the owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including an action taken to correct a malfunction) is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and the source exceeds any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standard, then the owner or operator must record the actions taken for that event and must report such actions within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event, in accordance with § 63.10(d)(5) (unless the owner or operator makes alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the Administrator).

              (v) The owner or operator must maintain at the affected source a current startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and must make the plan available upon request for inspection and copying by the Administrator. In addition, if the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is subsequently revised as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section, the owner or operator must maintain at the affected source each previous (i.e., superseded) version of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and must make each such previous version available for inspection and copying by the Administrator for a period of 5 years after revision of the plan. If at any time after adoption of a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan the affected source ceases operation or is otherwise no longer subject to the provisions of this part, the owner or operator must retain a copy of the most recent plan for 5 years from the date the source ceases operation or is no longer subject to this part and must make the plan available upon request for inspection and copying by the Administrator. The Administrator may at any time request in writing that the owner or operator submit a copy of any startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (or a portion thereof) which is maintained at the affected source or in the possession of the owner or operator. Upon receipt of such a request, the owner or operator must promptly submit a copy of the requested plan (or a portion thereof) to the Administrator. The owner or operator may elect to submit the required copy of any startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to the Administrator in an electronic format. If the owner or operator claims that any portion of such a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is confidential business information entitled to protection from disclosure under section 114(c) of the Act or 40 CFR 2.301, the material which is claimed as confidential must be clearly designated in the submission.
              (vi) To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection or submitted when requested by the Administrator.
              (vii) Based on the results of a determination made under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator must require appropriate revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan:
              (A) Does not address a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event that has occurred;
              (B) Fails to provide for the operation of the source (including associated air pollution control and monitoring equipment) during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event in a manner consistent with the general duty to minimize emissions established by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section;
              (C) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control and monitoring equipment as quickly as practicable; or
              (D) Includes an event that does not meet the definition of startup, shutdown, or malfunction listed in § 63.2.

              (viii) The owner or operator may periodically revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the affected source as necessary to satisfy the requirements of this part or to reflect changes in equipment or procedures at the affected source. Unless the permitting authority provides otherwise, the owner or operator may make such revisions to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan without prior approval by the Administrator or the permitting authority. However, each such revision to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan must be reported in the semiannual report required by § 63.10(d)(5). If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator must revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control and monitoring equipment. In the event that the owner or operator makes any revision to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which alters the scope of the activities at the source which are deemed to be a startup, shutdown, or malfunction, or otherwise modifies the applicability of any emission limit, work practice requirement, or other requirement in a standard established under this part, the revised plan shall not take effect until after the owner or operator has provided a written notice describing the revision to the permitting authority.
              (ix) The title V permit for an affected source must require that the owner or operator develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which conforms to the provisions of this part, but may do so by citing to the relevant subpart or subparagraphs of paragraph (e) of this section. However, any revisions made to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan in accordance with the procedures established by this part shall not be deemed to constitute permit revisions under part 70 or part 71 of this chapter and the elements of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan shall not be considered an applicable requirement as defined in § 70.2 and § 71.2 of this chapter. Moreover, none of the procedures specified by the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for an affected source shall be deemed to fall within the permit shield provision in section 504(f) of the Act.
              (f) Compliance with nonopacity emission standards—(1) Applicability. The non-opacity emission standards set forth in this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, and as otherwise specified in an applicable subpart. If a startup, shutdown, or malfunction of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of particular emission points within other portions of the affected source to comply with the non-opacity emission standards set forth in this part, then that emission point must still be required to comply with the non-opacity emission standards and other applicable requirements.
              (2) Methods for determining compliance. (i) The Administrator will determine compliance with nonopacity emission standards in this part based on the results of performance tests conducted according to the procedures in § 63.7, unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of this part.
              (ii) The Administrator will determine compliance with nonopacity emission standards in this part by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in § 63.6(e) and applicable subparts of this part.
              (iii) If an affected source conducts performance testing at startup to obtain an operating permit in the State in which the source is located, the results of such testing may be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard if—
              (A) The performance test was conducted within a reasonable amount of time before an initial performance test is required to be conducted under the relevant standard;
              (B) The performance test was conducted under representative operating conditions for the source;
              (C) The performance test was conducted and the resulting data were reduced using EPA-approved test methods and procedures, as specified in § 63.7(e) of this subpart; and
              (D) The performance test was appropriately quality-assured, as specified in § 63.7(c).
              (iv) The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards in this part by review of records, inspection of the source, and other procedures specified in applicable subparts of this part.
              (v) The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards in this part by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section and applicable subparts of this part.
              (3) Finding of compliance. The Administrator will make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with a non-opacity emission standard, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, upon obtaining all the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable), and information available to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
              (g) Use of an alternative nonopacity emission standard. (1) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator of an affected source has established that an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of a hazardous air pollutant from an affected source at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of that pollutant from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standard, or combination thereof, established under this part pursuant to section 112(h) of the Act, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative emission standard for purposes of compliance with the promulgated standard. Any Federal Register notice under this paragraph shall be published only after the public is notified and given the opportunity to comment. Such notice will restrict the permission to the stationary source(s) or category(ies) of sources from which the alternative emission standard will achieve equivalent emission reductions. The Administrator will condition permission in such notice on requirements to assure the proper operation and maintenance of equipment and practices required for compliance with the alternative emission standard and other requirements, including appropriate quality assurance and quality control requirements, that are deemed necessary.
              (2) An owner or operator requesting permission under this paragraph shall, unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart, submit a proposed test plan or the results of testing and monitoring in accordance with § 63.7 and § 63.8, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring. Any testing or monitoring conducted to request permission to use an alternative nonopacity emission standard shall be appropriately quality assured and quality controlled, as specified in § 63.7 and § 63.8.
              (3) The Administrator may establish general procedures in an applicable subpart that accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.
              (h) Compliance with opacity and visible emission standards—(1) Applicability. The opacity and visible emission standards set forth in this part must apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, and as otherwise specified in an applicable subpart. If a startup, shutdown, or malfunction of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of particular emission points within other portions of the affected source to comply with the opacity and visible emission standards set forth in this part, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the opacity and visible emission standards and other applicable requirements.
              (2) Methods for determining compliance. (i) The Administrator will determine compliance with opacity and visible emission standards in this part based on the results of the test method specified in an applicable subpart. Whenever a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) is required to be installed to determine compliance with numerical opacity emission standards in this part, compliance with opacity emission standards in this part shall be determined by using the results from the COMS. Whenever an opacity emission test method is not specified, compliance with opacity emission standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Test Method 9 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter or the method specified in paragraph (h)(7)(ii) of this section. Whenever a visible emission test method is not specified, compliance with visible emission standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              
              (iii) If an affected source undergoes opacity or visible emission testing at startup to obtain an operating permit in the State in which the source is located, the results of such testing may be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard if—
              (A) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted within a reasonable amount of time before a performance test is required to be conducted under the relevant standard;
              (B) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted under representative operating conditions for the source;
              (C) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted and the resulting data were reduced using EPA-approved test methods and procedures, as specified in § 63.7(e); and
              (D) The opacity or visible emission test was appropriately quality-assured, as specified in § 63.7(c) of this section.
              (3) [Reserved]
              (4) Notification of opacity or visible emission observations. The owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator in writing of the anticipated date for conducting opacity or visible emission observations in accordance with § 63.9(f), if such observations are required for the source by a relevant standard.
              (5) Conduct of opacity or visible emission observations. When a relevant standard under this part includes an opacity or visible emission standard, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the following:
              (i) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required in § 63.7 unless one of the following conditions applies:
              (A) If no performance test under § 63.7 is required, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which a new or reconstructed source will be operated, but not later than 120 days after initial startup of the source, or within 120 days after the effective date of the relevant standard in the case of new sources that start up before the standard's effective date. If no performance test under § 63.7 is required, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted within 120 days after the compliance date for an existing or modified source; or
              (B) If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 63.7, or within the time period specified in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the source's owner or operator shall reschedule the opacity or visible emission observations as soon after the initial performance test, or time period, as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. The rescheduled opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted under § 63.7. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance with procedures contained in Test Method 9 or Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.
              (ii) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, the minimum total time of opacity observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance test or other required set of observations (e.g., for fugitive-type emission sources subject only to an opacity emission standard).
              (iii) The owner or operator of an affected source to which an opacity or visible emission standard in this part applies shall conduct opacity or visible emission observations in accordance with the provisions of this section, record the results of the evaluation of emissions, and report to the Administrator the opacity or visible emission results in accordance with the provisions of § 63.10(d).
              (iv) [Reserved]

              (v) Opacity readings of portions of plumes that contain condensed, uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determining compliance with opacity emission standards.
              
              (6) Availability of records. The owner or operator of an affected source shall make available, upon request by the Administrator, such records that the Administrator deems necessary to determine the conditions under which the visual observations were made and shall provide evidence indicating proof of current visible observer emission certification.
              (7) Use of a continuous opacity monitoring system. (i) The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) shall record the monitoring data produced during a performance test required under § 63.7 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results in accordance with the provisions of § 63.10(e)(4).
              (ii) Whenever an opacity emission test method has not been specified in an applicable subpart, or an owner or operator of an affected source is required to conduct Test Method 9 observations (see appendix A of part 60 of this chapter), the owner or operator may submit, for compliance purposes, COMS data results produced during any performance test required under § 63.7 in lieu of Method 9 data. If the owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the opacity emission standard, he or she shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in writing, simultaneously with the notification under § 63.7(b) of the date the performance test is scheduled to begin. Once the owner or operator of an affected source has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent performance tests required under § 63.7, unless the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing to the contrary not later than with the notification under § 63.7(b) of the date the subsequent performance test is scheduled to begin.
              (iii) For the purposes of determining compliance with the opacity emission standard during a performance test required under § 63.7 using COMS data, the COMS data shall be reduced to 6-minute averages over the duration of the mass emission performance test.
              (iv) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS for compliance purposes is responsible for demonstrating that he/she has complied with the performance evaluation requirements of § 63.8(e), that the COMS has been properly maintained, operated, and data quality-assured, as specified in § 63.8(c) and § 63.8(d), and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.
              (v) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(7)(ii) of this section, the results of continuous monitoring by a COMS that indicate that the opacity at the time visual observations were made was not in excess of the emission standard are probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an emission, provided that the affected source proves that, at the time of the alleged violation, the instrument used was properly maintained, as specified in § 63.8(c), and met Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of part 60 of this chapter, and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.
              (8) Finding of compliance. The Administrator will make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with an opacity or visible emission standard upon obtaining all the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of the results of the performance tests required by § 63.7, the results of Test Method 9 or another required opacity or visible emission test method, the observer certification required by paragraph (h)(6) of this section, and the continuous opacity monitoring system results, whichever is/are applicable) and any information available to the Administrator needed to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used.
              (9) Adjustment to an opacity emission standard. (i) If the Administrator finds under paragraph (h)(8) of this section that an affected source is in compliance with all relevant standards for which initial performance tests were conducted under § 63.7, but during the time such performance tests were conducted fails to meet any relevant opacity emission standard, the owner or operator of such source may petition the Administrator to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity emission standard for the affected source. Until the Administrator notifies the owner or operator of the appropriate adjustment, the relevant opacity emission standard remains applicable.
              (ii) The Administrator may grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that—
              (A) The affected source and its associated air pollution control equipment were operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests;
              (B) The performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the Administrator; and
              (C) The affected source and its associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the relevant opacity emission standard.

              (iii) The Administrator will establish an adjusted opacity emission standard for the affected source meeting the above requirements at a level at which the source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, to meet the opacity emission standard at all times during which the source is meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator will promulgate the new opacity emission standard in the Federal Register.
              
              (iv) After the Administrator promulgates an adjusted opacity emission standard for an affected source, the owner or operator of such source shall be subject to the new opacity emission standard, and the new opacity emission standard shall apply to such source during any subsequent performance tests.
              (i) Extension of compliance with emission standards. (1) Until an extension of compliance has been granted by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this section shall comply with all applicable requirements of this part.
              (2) Extension of compliance for early reductions and other reductions—(i) Early reductions. Pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants in accordance with the provisions of subpart D of this part, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with specific requirements of this part, as specified in subpart D.
              (ii) Other reductions. Pursuant to section 112(i)(6) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source has installed best available control technology (BACT) (as defined in section 169(3) of the Act) or technology required to meet a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) (as defined in section 171 of the Act) prior to the promulgation of an emission standard in this part applicable to such source and the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) controlled pursuant to the BACT or LAER installation, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with such emission standard that will apply until the date 5 years after the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator.
              (3) Request for extension of compliance. Paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(7) of this section concern requests for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this part (except requests for an extension of compliance under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section will be handled through procedures specified in subpart D of this part).

              (4)(i)(A) The owner or operator of an existing source who is unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act may request that the Administrator (or a State, when the State has an approved part 70 permit program and the source is required to obtain a part 70 permit under that program, or a State, when the State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce the emission standard for that source) grant an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. An additional extension of up to 3 years may be added for mining waste operations, if the 1-year extension of compliance is insufficient to dry and cover mining waste in order to reduce emissions of any hazardous air pollutant. The owner or operator of an affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.
              (B) Any request under this paragraph for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard must be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority no later than 120 days prior to the affected source's compliance date (as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section), except as provided for in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Nonfrivolous requests submitted under this paragraph will stay the applicability of the rule as to the emission points in question until such time as the request is granted or denied. A denial will be effective as of the date of denial. Emission standards established under this part may specify alternative dates for the submittal of requests for an extension of compliance if alternatives are appropriate for the source categories affected by those standards.
              (C) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(B) of this section provided the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and before the otherwise applicable compliance date and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request must include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section, a statement of the reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of the problems. Nonfrivolous requests submitted under this paragraph will stay the applicability of the rule as to the emission points in question until such time as the request is granted or denied. A denial will be effective as of the original compliance date.
              (ii) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 2 years after the standard's effective date to comply with the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he/she finds that such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls and that steps will be taken during the period of the extension to assure that the health of persons will be protected from imminent endangerment. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph must be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 90 calendar days after the effective date of the relevant standard.
              (5) The owner or operator of an existing source that has installed BACT or technology required to meet LAER [as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section] prior to the promulgation of a relevant emission standard in this part may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source 5 years from the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator, to comply with the standard. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 120 days after the promulgation date of the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he or she finds that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
              (6)(i) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (i)(4) of this section shall include the following information:
              (A) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard;

              (B) A compliance schedule, including the date by which each step toward compliance will be reached. At a minimum, the list of dates shall include:
              (1) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is planned to be initiated; and
              (2) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved.
              (3) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is to be completed; and
              (4) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved;
              (C)-(D)
              (ii) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (i)(5) of this section shall include all information needed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
              (7) Advice on requesting an extension of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program).
              (8) Approval of request for extension of compliance. Paragraphs (i)(9) through (i)(14) of this section concern approval of an extension of compliance requested under paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section.
              (9) Based on the information provided in any request made under paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, or other information, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) may grant an extension of compliance with an emission standard, as specified in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(5) of this section.
              (10) The extension will be in writing and will—
              (i) Identify each affected source covered by the extension;
              (ii) Specify the termination date of the extension;
              (iii) Specify the dates by which steps toward compliance are to be taken, if appropriate;
              (iv) Specify other applicable requirements to which the compliance extension applies (e.g., performance tests); and
              (v)(A) Under paragraph (i)(4), specify any additional conditions that the Administrator (or the State) deems necessary to assure installation of the necessary controls and protection of the health of persons during the extension period; or
              (B) Under paragraph (i)(5), specify any additional conditions that the Administrator deems necessary to assure the proper operation and maintenance of the installed controls during the extension period.
              (11) The owner or operator of an existing source that has been granted an extension of compliance under paragraph (i)(10) of this section may be required to submit to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) progress reports indicating whether the steps toward compliance outlined in the compliance schedule have been reached. The contents of the progress reports and the dates by which they shall be submitted will be specified in the written extension of compliance granted under paragraph (i)(10) of this section.
              (12)(i) The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (i)(5) of this section. The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete.

              (ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
              (iii) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's (or the State's) intention to issue the denial, together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator (or the State) before further action on the request.
              (iv) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
              (13)(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 15 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 15 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.
              (ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
              (iii) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the request.
              (iv) A final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
              (14) The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) may terminate an extension of compliance at an earlier date than specified if any specification under paragraph (i)(10)(iii) or (iv) of this section is not met. Upon a determination to terminate, the Administrator will notify, in writing, the owner or operator of the Administrator's determination to terminate, together with:
              (i) Notice of the reason for termination; and
              (ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the determination to terminate, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the termination.

              (iii) A final determination to terminate an extension of compliance will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the termination is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after presentation of additional information or arguments, or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
              (15) [Reserved]
              (16) The granting of an extension under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.
              (j) Exemption from compliance with emission standards. The President may exempt any stationary source from compliance with any relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for a period of not more than 2 years if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so. An exemption under this paragraph may be extended for 1 or more additional periods, each period not to exceed 2 years.
              [59 FR 12430, Mar. 16, 1994, as amended at 67 FR 16599, Apr. 5, 2002; 68 FR 32600, May 30, 2003; 71 FR 20454, Apr. 20, 2006]
            
            
              § 63.7
              Performance testing requirements.
              (a) Applicability and performance test dates. (1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, if required to do performance testing by a relevant standard, and unless a waiver of performance testing is obtained under this section or the conditions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section apply, the owner or operator of the affected source must perform such tests within 180 days of the compliance date for such source.
              (i)-(viii) [Reserved]
              (ix) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, when an emission standard promulgated under this part is more stringent than the standard proposed (see § 63.6(b)(3)), the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to that standard for which construction or reconstruction is commenced between the proposal and promulgation dates of the standard shall comply with performance testing requirements within 180 days after the standard's effective date, or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later. If the promulgated standard is more stringent than the proposed standard, the owner or operator may choose to demonstrate compliance with either the proposed or the promulgated standard. If the owner or operator chooses to comply with the proposed standard initially, the owner or operator shall conduct a second performance test within 3 years and 180 days after the effective date of the standard, or after startup of the source, whichever is later, to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated standard.
              (3) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to conduct performance tests at the affected source at any other time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.
              (4) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure:
              (i) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, or elsewhere in this part, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.

              (ii) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.
              
              (iii) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.
              (iv) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (a)(4)(ii), and (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
              (b) Notification of performance test. (1) The owner or operator of an affected source must notify the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to conduct a performance test at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is initially scheduled to begin to allow the Administrator, upon request, to review an approve the site-specific test plan required under paragraph (c) of this section and to have an observer present during the test.
              (2) In the event the owner or operator is unable to conduct the performance test on the date specified in the notification requirement specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his or her control, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator as soon as practicable and without delay prior to the scheduled performance test date and specify the date when the performance test is rescheduled. This notification of delay in conducting the performance test shall not relieve the owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any other applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement, nor will it prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
              (c) Quality assurance program. (1) The results of the quality assurance program required in this paragraph will be considered by the Administrator when he/she determines the validity of a performance test.
              (2)(i) Submission of site-specific test plan. Before conducting a required performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source shall develop and, if requested by the Administrator, shall submit a site-specific test plan to the Administrator for approval. The test plan shall include a test program summary, the test schedule, data quality objectives, and both an internal and external quality assurance (QA) program. Data quality objectives are the pretest expectations of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data.
              (ii) The internal QA program shall include, at a minimum, the activities planned by routine operators and analysts to provide an assessment of test data precision; an example of internal QA is the sampling and analysis of replicate samples.

              (iii) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.

              (A) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60; Methods 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60; Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of this part. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request, and the compliance authority may grant, a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.
              (B) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
              (1) Preparing the sample;
              (2) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;
              (3) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;
              (4) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;
              (5) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;
              (6) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;
              (7) Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.
              (8) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed.
              (9) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.
              (C) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
              (1) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.
              (2) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.
              (3) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.

              (D) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm. The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B) through (C) of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
              
              (iv) The owner or operator of an affected source shall submit the site-specific test plan to the Administrator upon the Administrator's request at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to take place, that is, simultaneously with the notification of intention to conduct a performance test required under paragraph (b) of this section, or on a mutually agreed upon date.
              (v) The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a site-specific test plan.
              (3) Approval of site-specific test plan. (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original plan and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. Before disapproving any site-specific test plan, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the plan together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and
              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended disapproval, additional information to the Administrator before final action on the plan.
              (ii) In the event that the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the site-specific test plan within the time period specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the following conditions shall apply:
              (A) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance using the test method(s) specified in the relevant standard or with only minor changes to those tests methods (see paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section), the owner or operator must conduct the performance test within the time specified in this section using the specified method(s);

              (B) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method when the Administrator approves the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) or after the alternative method is approved (see paragraph (f) of this section). However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval 45 days after submission of the site-specific test plan or request to use an alternative method. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.
              (iii) Neither the submission of a site-specific test plan for approval, nor the Administrator's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall—
              (A) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
              (B) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
              (d) Performance testing facilities. If required to do performance testing, the owner or operator of each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing source, shall provide performance testing facilities as follows:
              (1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such source. This includes:
              (i) Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures; and
              (ii) Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures;
              (2) Safe sampling platform(s);
              (3) Safe access to sampling platform(s);
              (4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and
              (5) Any other facilities that the Administrator deems necessary for safe and adequate testing of a source.
              (e) Conduct of performance tests. (1) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating conditions) of the affected source. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test, nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the relevant standard during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction be considered a violation of the relevant standard unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard or a determination of noncompliance is made under § 63.6(e). Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (2) Performance tests shall be conducted and data shall be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures set forth in this section, in each relevant standard, and, if required, in applicable appendices of parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter unless the Administrator—
              (i) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a test method with minor changes in methodology (see definition in § 63.90(a)). Such changes may be approved in conjunction with approval of the site-specific test plan (see paragraph (c) of this section); or
              (ii) Approves the use of an intermediate or major change or alternative to a test method (see definitions in § 63.90(a)), the results of which the Administrator has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific affected source is in compliance; or
              (iii) Approves shorter sampling times or smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors; or
              (iv) Waives the requirement for performance tests because the owner or operator of an affected source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant standard.
              (3) Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the relevant standard. For the purpose of determining compliance with a relevant standard, the arithmetic mean of the results of the three runs shall apply. Upon receiving approval from the Administrator, results of a test run may be replaced with results of an additional test run in the event that—

              (i) A sample is accidentally lost after the testing team leaves the site; or
              
              (ii) Conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown; or
              (iii) Extreme meteorological conditions occur; or
              (iv) Other circumstances occur that are beyond the owner or operator's control.
              (4) Nothing in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section shall be construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Act.
              (f) Use of an alternative test method—(1)General. Until authorized to use an intermediate or major change or alternative to a test method, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.
              (2) The owner or operator of an affected source required to do performance testing by a relevant standard may use an alternative test method from that specified in the standard provided that the owner or operator—
              (i) Notifies the Administrator of his or her intention to use an alternative test method at least 60 days before the performance test is scheduled to begin;
              (ii) Uses Method 301 in appendix A of this part to validate the alternative test method. This may include the use of specific procedures of Method 301 if use of such procedures are sufficient to validate the alternative test method; and
              (iii) Submits the results of the Method 301 validation process along with the notification of intention and the justification for not using the specified test method. The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the deadline specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the performance test date specified in this section or the relevant standard.
              (3) The Administrator will determine whether the owner or operator's validation of the proposed alternative test method is adequate and issue an approval or disapproval of the alternative test method. If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval/disapproval 45 days after submission of the request to use an alternative method and the request satisfies the requirements in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.
              (4) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative test method for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with a relevant standard, the Administrator may require the use of a test method specified in a relevant standard.
              (5) If the owner or operator uses an alternative test method for an affected source during a required performance test, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative test method for subsequent performance tests at that affected source until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another test method as allowed under § 63.7(f).
              (6) Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate an alternative test method shall abrogate the owner or operator's responsibility to comply with the requirements of this part.
              (g) Data analysis, recordkeeping, and reporting. (1) Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, results of a performance test shall include the analysis of samples, determination of emissions, and raw data. A performance test is “completed” when field sample collection is terminated. The owner or operator of an affected source shall report the results of the performance test to the Administrator before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the performance test, unless specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as approved otherwise in writing by the Administrator (see § 63.9(i)). The results of the performance test shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required under § 63.9(h). Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall send the results of the performance test to the Administrator. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall send the results of the performance test to the appropriate permitting authority.
              (2) Contents of a performance test, CMS performance evaluation, or CMS quality assurance test report (electronic or paper submitted copy). Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard, test method, CMS performance specification, or quality assurance requirement for a CMS, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, the report shall include the elements identified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
              (i) General identification information for the facility including a mailing address, the physical address, the owner or operator or responsible official (where applicable) and his/her email address, and the appropriate Federal Registry System (FRS) number for the facility.
              (ii) Purpose of the test including the applicable regulation requiring the test, the pollutant(s) and other parameters being measured, the applicable emission standard, and any process parameter component, and a brief process description.
              (iii) Description of the emission unit tested including fuel burned, control devices, and vent characteristics; the appropriate source classification code (SCC); the permitted maximum process rate (where applicable); and the sampling location.
              (iv) Description of sampling and analysis procedures used and any modifications to standard procedures, quality assurance procedures and results, record of process operating conditions that demonstrate the applicable test conditions are met, and values for any operating parameters for which limits were being set during the test.
              (v) Where a test method, CEMS, PEMS, or COMS performance specification, or on-going quality assurance requirement for a CEMS, PEMS, or COMS requires you record or report, the following shall be included in your report: Record of preparation of standards, record of calibrations, raw data sheets for field sampling, raw data sheets for field and laboratory analyses, chain-of-custody documentation, and example calculations for reported results.
              (vi) Identification of the company conducting the performance test including the primary office address, telephone number, and the contact for this test including his/her email address.
              (3) For a minimum of 5 years after a performance test is conducted, the owner or operator shall retain and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator the records or results of such performance test and other data needed to determine emissions from an affected source.
              (h) Waiver of performance tests. (1) Until a waiver of a performance testing requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.
              (2) Individual performance tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
              (3) Request to waive a performance test. (i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i), the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested or if the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if the site-specific test plan under paragraph (c) of this section is not submitted.
              (ii) If an application for a waiver of a subsequent performance test is made, the application may accompany any required compliance progress report, compliance status report, or excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report [such as those required under § 63.6(i), § 63.9(h), and § 63.10(e) or specified in a relevant standard or in the source's title V permit], but it shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if the site-specific test plan required under paragraph (c) of this section is not submitted.
              (iii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source performing the required test.
              (4) Approval of request to waive performance test. The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of a performance test made under paragraph (h)(3) of this section when he/she—
              (i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i)(8); or
              (ii) Approves or disapproves a site-specific test plan under § 63.7(c)(3); or
              (iii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
              (iv) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
              (5) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.
              [59 FR 12430, Mar. 16, 1994, as amended at 65 FR 62215, Oct. 17, 2000; 67 FR 16602, Apr. 5, 2002; 72 FR 27443, May 16, 2007; 75 FR 55655, Sept. 13, 2010; 79 FR 11277, Feb. 27, 2014; 81 FR 59825, Aug. 30, 2016; 83 FR 56725, Nov. 14, 2018]
            
            
              § 63.8
              Monitoring requirements.
              (a) Applicability. (1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
              (2) For the purposes of this part, all CMS required under relevant standards shall be subject to the provisions of this section upon promulgation of performance specifications for CMS as specified in the relevant standard or otherwise by the Administrator.
              (3) [Reserved]
              (4) Additional monitoring requirements for control devices used to comply with provisions in relevant standards of this part are specified in § 63.11.
              (b) Conduct of monitoring. (1) Monitoring shall be conducted as set forth in this section and the relevant standard(s) unless the Administrator—
              (i) Specifies or approves the use of minor changes in methodology for the specified monitoring requirements and procedures (see § 63.90(a) for definition); or
              (ii) Approves the use of an intermediate or major change or alternative to any monitoring requirements or procedures (see § 63.90(a) for definition).
              (iii) Owners or operators with flares subject to § 63.11(b) are not subject to the requirements of this section unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard.
              (2)(i) When the emissions from two or more affected sources are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator may install an applicable CMS for each emission stream or for the combined emissions streams, provided the monitoring is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the relevant standard.

              (ii) If the relevant standard is a mass emission standard and the emissions from one affected source are released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator must install an applicable CMS at each emission point unless the installation of fewer systems is—
              (A) Approved by the Administrator; or
              (B) Provided for in a relevant standard (e.g., instead of requiring that a CMS be installed at each emission point before the effluents from those points are channeled to a common control device, the standard specifies that only one CMS is required to be installed at the vent of the control device).
              (3) When more than one CMS is used to measure the emissions from one affected source (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each CMS. However, when one CMS is used as a backup to another CMS, the owner or operator shall report the results from the CMS used to meet the monitoring requirements of this part. If both such CMS are used during a particular reporting period to meet the monitoring requirements of this part, then the owner or operator shall report the results from each CMS for the relevant compliance period.
              (c) Operation and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems. (1) The owner or operator of an affected source shall maintain and operate each CMS as specified in this section, or in a relevant standard, and in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices. (i) The owner or operator of an affected source must maintain and operate each CMS as specified in § 63.6(e)(1).
              (ii) The owner or operator must keep the necessary parts for routine repairs of the affected CMS equipment readily available.
              (iii) The owner or operator of an affected source must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for CMS as specified in § 63.6(e)(3).
              (2)(i) All CMS must be installed such that representative measures of emissions or process parameters from the affected source are obtained. In addition, CEMS must be located according to procedures contained in the applicable performance specification(s).
              (ii) Unless the individual subpart states otherwise, the owner or operator must ensure the read out (that portion of the CMS that provides a visual display or record), or other indication of operation, from any CMS required for compliance with the emission standard is readily accessible on site for operational control or inspection by the operator of the equipment.
              (3) All CMS shall be installed, operational, and the data verified as specified in the relevant standard either prior to or in conjunction with conducting performance tests under § 63.7. Verification of operational status shall, at a minimum, include completion of the manufacturer's written specifications or recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the system.
              (4) Except for system breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drift adjustments, all CMS, including COMS and CEMS, shall be in continuous operation and shall meet minimum frequency of operation requirements as follows:
              (i) All COMS shall complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.
              (ii) All CEMS for measuring emissions other than opacity shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
              (5) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, minimum procedures for COMS shall include a method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and an upscale (high-level) opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known obscuration of the light beam. Such procedures shall provide a system check of all the analyzer's internal optical surfaces and all electronic circuitry, including the lamp and photodetector assembly normally used in the measurement of opacity.

              (6) The owner or operator of a CMS that is not a CPMS, which is installed in accordance with the provisions of this part and the applicable CMS performance specification(s), must check the zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts at least once daily in accordance with the written procedure specified in the performance evaluation plan developed under paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. The zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts must be adjusted, at a minimum, whenever the 24-hour zero (low-level) drift exceeds two times the limits of the applicable performance specification(s) specified in the relevant standard. The system shall allow the amount of excess zero (low-level) and high-level drift measured at the 24-hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified whenever specified. For COMS, all optical and instrumental surfaces exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the zero (low-level) and high-level drift adjustments; the optical surfaces and instrumental surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation, if applicable, exceeds 4 percent opacity. The CPMS must be calibrated prior to use for the purposes of complying with this section. The CPMS must be checked daily for indication that the system is responding. If the CPMS system includes an internal system check, results must be recorded and checked daily for proper operation.
              (7)(i) A CMS is out of control if—
              (A) The zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable), or high-level calibration drift (CD) exceeds two times the applicable CD specification in the applicable performance specification or in the relevant standard; or
              (B) The CMS fails a performance test audit (e.g., cylinder gas audit), relative accuracy audit, relative accuracy test audit, or linearity test audit; or
              (C) The COMS CD exceeds two times the limit in the applicable performance specification in the relevant standard.
              (ii) When the CMS is out of control, the owner or operator of the affected source shall take the necessary corrective action and shall repeat all necessary tests which indicate that the system is out of control. The owner or operator shall take corrective action and conduct retesting until the performance requirements are below the applicable limits. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour the owner or operator conducts a performance check (e.g., calibration drift) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established under this part. The end of the out-of-control period is the hour following the completion of corrective action and successful demonstration that the system is within the allowable limits. During the period the CMS is out of control, recorded data shall not be used in data averages and calculations, or to meet any data availability requirement established under this part.
              (8) The owner or operator of a CMS that is out of control as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section shall submit all information concerning out-of-control periods, including start and end dates and hours and descriptions of corrective actions taken, in the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required in § 63.10(e)(3).
              (d) Quality control program. (1) The results of the quality control program required in this paragraph will be considered by the Administrator when he/she determines the validity of monitoring data.
              (2) The owner or operator of an affected source that is required to use a CMS and is subject to the monitoring requirements of this section and a relevant standard shall develop and implement a CMS quality control program. As part of the quality control program, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request a site-specific performance evaluation test plan for the CMS performance evaluation required in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, according to the procedures specified in paragraph (e). In addition, each quality control program shall include, at a minimum, a written protocol that describes procedures for each of the following operations:
              (i) Initial and any subsequent calibration of the CMS;
              (ii) Determination and adjustment of the calibration drift of the CMS;
              (iii) Preventive maintenance of the CMS, including spare parts inventory;
              (iv) Data recording, calculations, and reporting;

              (v) Accuracy audit procedures, including sampling and analysis methods; and
              
              (vi) Program of corrective action for a malfunctioning CMS.
              (3) The owner or operator shall keep these written procedures on record for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. Where relevant, e.g., program of corrective action for a malfunctioning CMS, these written procedures may be incorporated as part of the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to avoid duplication of planning and recordkeeping efforts.
              (e) Performance evaluation of continuous monitoring systems—(1) General. When required by a relevant standard, and at any other time the Administrator may require under section 114 of the Act, the owner or operator of an affected source being monitored shall conduct a performance evaluation of the CMS. Such performance evaluation shall be conducted according to the applicable specifications and procedures described in this section or in the relevant standard.
              (2) Notification of performance evaluation. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing of the date of the performance evaluation simultaneously with the notification of the performance test date required under § 63.7(b) or at least 60 days prior to the date the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin if no performance test is required.
              (3)(i) Submission of site-specific performance evaluation test plan. Before conducting a required CMS performance evaluation, the owner or operator of an affected source shall develop and submit a site-specific performance evaluation test plan to the Administrator for approval upon request. The performance evaluation test plan shall include the evaluation program objectives, an evaluation program summary, the performance evaluation schedule, data quality objectives, and both an internal and external QA program. Data quality objectives are the pre-evaluation expectations of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data.
              (ii) The internal QA program shall include, at a minimum, the activities planned by routine operators and analysts to provide an assessment of CMS performance. The external QA program shall include, at a minimum, systems audits that include the opportunity for on-site evaluation by the Administrator of instrument calibration, data validation, sample logging, and documentation of quality control data and field maintenance activities.
              (iii) The owner or operator of an affected source shall submit the site-specific performance evaluation test plan to the Administrator (if requested) at least 60 days before the performance test or performance evaluation is scheduled to begin, or on a mutually agreed upon date, and review and approval of the performance evaluation test plan by the Administrator will occur with the review and approval of the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested).
              (iv) The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a site-specific performance evaluation test plan.
              (v) In the event that the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the site-specific performance evaluation test plan within the time period specified in § 63.7(c)(3), the following conditions shall apply:
              (A) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance using the monitoring method(s) specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator shall conduct the performance evaluation within the time specified in this subpart using the specified method(s);

              (B) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to a monitoring method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator shall refrain from conducting the performance evaluation until the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. If the Administrator does not approve the use of the alternative method within 30 days before the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin, the performance evaluation deadlines specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section may be extended such that the owner or operator shall conduct the performance evaluation within 60 calendar days after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding two sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance evaluation as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific performance evaluation test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified monitoring method(s) instead of an alternative.
              (vi) Neither the submission of a site-specific performance evaluation test plan for approval, nor the Administrator's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall—
              (A) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
              (B) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
              (4) Conduct of performance evaluation and performance evaluation dates. The owner or operator of an affected source shall conduct a performance evaluation of a required CMS during any performance test required under § 63.7 in accordance with the applicable performance specification as specified in the relevant standard. Notwithstanding the requirement in the previous sentence, if the owner or operator of an affected source elects to submit COMS data for compliance with a relevant opacity emission standard as provided under § 63.6(h)(7), he/she shall conduct a performance evaluation of the COMS as specified in the relevant standard, before the performance test required under § 63.7 is conducted in time to submit the results of the performance evaluation as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section. If a performance test is not required, or the requirement for a performance test has been waived under § 63.7(h), the owner or operator of an affected source shall conduct the performance evaluation not later than 180 days after the appropriate compliance date for the affected source, as specified in § 63.7(a), or as otherwise specified in the relevant standard.
              (5) Reporting performance evaluation results. (i) The owner or operator shall furnish the Administrator a copy of a written report of the results of the performance evaluation containing the information specified in § 63.7(g)(2)(i) through (vi) simultaneously with the results of the performance test required under § 63.7 or within 60 days of completion of the performance evaluation, unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard.
              (ii) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS to determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under § 63.7 and described in § 63.6(d)(6) shall furnish the Administrator two or, upon request, three copies of a written report of the results of the COMS performance evaluation under this paragraph. The copies shall be provided at least 15 calendar days before the performance test required under § 63.7 is conducted.
              (f) Use of an alternative monitoring method—(1) General. Until permission to use an alternative monitoring procedure (minor, intermediate, or major changes; see definition in § 63.90(a)) has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph (f)(1), the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.
              (2) After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring methods or procedures of this part including, but not limited to, the following:
              (i) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a CMS specified by a relevant standard would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances within the effluent gases;

              (ii) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected source is infrequently operated;
              
              (iii) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate CEMS that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions;
              (iv) Alternative locations for installing CMS when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements;
              (v) Alternate methods for converting pollutant concentration measurements to units of the relevant standard;
              (vi) Alternate procedures for performing daily checks of zero (low-level) and high-level drift that do not involve use of high-level gases or test cells;
              (vii) Alternatives to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test methods or sampling procedures specified by any relevant standard;
              (viii) Alternative CMS that do not meet the design or performance requirements in this part, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between their measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements as specified in the relevant standard. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected source; or
              (ix) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected source or the combined effluent from two or more affected sources is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.
              (3) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, requirement, or procedure, the Administrator may require the use of a method, requirement, or procedure specified in this section or in the relevant standard. If the results of the specified and alternative method, requirement, or procedure do not agree, the results obtained by the specified method, requirement, or procedure shall prevail.
              (4)(i) Request to use alternative monitoring procedure. An owner or operator who wishes to use an alternative monitoring procedure must submit an application to the Administrator as described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. The application may be submitted at any time provided that the monitoring procedure is not the performance test method used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard or other requirement. If the alternative monitoring procedure will serve as the performance test method that is to be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard, the application must be submitted at least 60 days before the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin and must meet the requirements for an alternative test method under § 63.7(f).
              (ii) The application must contain a description of the proposed alternative monitoring system which addresses the four elements contained in the definition of monitoring in § 63.2 and a performance evaluation test plan, if required, as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. In addition, the application must include information justifying the owner or operator's request for an alternative monitoring method, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source using the required method.
              (iii) The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the submittal dates specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i) above to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the compliance demonstration date specified in this section or the relevant standard.
              (iv) Application for minor changes to monitoring procedures, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may be made in the site-specific performance evaluation plan.
              (5) Approval of request to use alternative monitoring procedure. (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the request to use an alternative monitoring method within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. If a request for a minor change is made in conjunction with site-specific performance evaluation plan, then approval of the plan will constitute approval of the minor change. Before disapproving any request to use an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with—
              (A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and
              (B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the Administrator notifies the applicant of his or her intention to disapprove the request, the Administrator will specify how much time the owner or operator will have after being notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional information.
              (ii) The Administrator may establish general procedures and criteria in a relevant standard to accomplish the requirements of paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section.
              (iii) If the Administrator approves the use of an alternative monitoring method for an affected source under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative monitoring method until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another monitoring method as allowed by § 63.8(f).
              (6) Alternative to the relative accuracy test. An alternative to the relative accuracy test for CEMS specified in a relevant standard may be requested as follows:
              (i) Criteria for approval of alternative procedures. An alternative to the test method for determining relative accuracy is available for affected sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. The owner or operator of an affected source may petition the Administrator under paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section to substitute the relative accuracy test in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 with the procedures in section 10 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements in § 63.7, or other tests performed following the criteria in § 63.7, demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the relevant standard is less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator to substitute the relative accuracy test with the procedures in section 10 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the CEMS is used continuously to determine compliance with the relevant standard.
              (ii) Petition to use alternative to relative accuracy test. The petition to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied, the location and the procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative relative accuracy materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure(s). The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The Administrator's determination to approve an alternative will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2.
              (iii) Rescission of approval to use alternative to relative accuracy test. The Administrator will review the permission to use an alternative to the CEMS relative accuracy test and may rescind such permission if the CEMS data from a successful completion of the alternative relative accuracy procedure indicate that the affected source's emissions are approaching the level of the relevant standard. The criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the relevant standard for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. The owner or operator of the affected source shall maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion for permission to use an alternative for relative accuracy testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 7 of Performance Specification 2. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 8.4 of Performance Specification 2.
              (g) Reduction of monitoring data. (1) The owner or operator of each CMS must reduce the monitoring data as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (2) The owner or operator of each COMS shall reduce all data to 6-minute averages calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data from CEMS for measurement other than opacity, unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard, shall be reduced to 1-hour averages computed from four or more data points equally spaced over each 1-hour period, except during periods when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities pursuant to provisions of this part are being performed. During these periods, a valid hourly average shall consist of at least two data points with each representing a 15-minute period. Alternatively, an arithmetic or integrated 1-hour average of CEMS data may be used. Time periods for averaging are defined in § 63.2.

              (3) The data may be recorded in reduced or nonreduced form (e.g., ppm pollutant and percent O2 or ng/J of pollutant).
              (4) All emission data shall be converted into units of the relevant standard for reporting purposes using the conversion procedures specified in that standard. After conversion into units of the relevant standard, the data may be rounded to the same number of significant digits as used in that standard to specify the emission limit (e.g., rounded to the nearest 1 percent opacity).
              (5) Monitoring data recorded during periods of unavoidable CMS breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments must not be included in any data average computed under this part. For the owner or operator complying with the requirements of § 63.10(b)(2)(vii)(A) or (B), data averages must include any data recorded during periods of monitor breakdown or malfunction.

              § 63.9
              Notification requirements.
              (a) Applicability and general information. (1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
              (2) For affected sources that have been granted an extension of compliance under subpart D of this part, the requirements of this section do not apply to those sources while they are operating under such compliance extensions.
              (3) If any State requires a notice that contains all the information required in a notification listed in this section, the owner or operator may send the Administrator a copy of the notice sent to the State to satisfy the requirements of this section for that notification.

              (4)(i) Before a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce notification requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit notifications to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA (to the attention of the Director of the Division indicated in the list of the EPA Regional Offices in § 63.13).
              
              (ii) After a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce notification requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit notifications to the delegated State authority (which may be the same as the permitting authority). In addition, if the delegated (permitting) authority is the State, the owner or operator shall send a copy of each notification submitted to the State to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA, as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Regional Office may waive this requirement for any notifications at its discretion.
              (b) Initial notifications. (1)(i) The requirements of this paragraph apply to the owner or operator of an affected source when such source becomes subject to a relevant standard.
              (ii) If an area source that otherwise would be subject to an emission standard or other requirement established under this part if it were a major source subsequently increases its emissions of hazardous air pollutants (or its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants) such that the source is a major source that is subject to the emission standard or other requirement, such source shall be subject to the notification requirements of this section.
              (iii) Affected sources that are required under this paragraph to submit an initial notification may use the application for approval of construction or reconstruction under § 63.5(d) of this subpart, if relevant, to fulfill the initial notification requirements of this paragraph.
              (2) The owner or operator of an affected source that has an initial startup before the effective date of a relevant standard under this part shall notify the Administrator in writing that the source is subject to the relevant standard. The notification, which shall be submitted not later than 120 calendar days after the effective date of the relevant standard (or within 120 calendar days after the source becomes subject to the relevant standard), shall provide the following information:
              (i) The name and address of the owner or operator;
              (ii) The address (i.e., physical location) of the affected source;
              (iii) An identification of the relevant standard, or other requirement, that is the basis of the notification and the source's compliance date;
              (iv) A brief description of the nature, size, design, and method of operation of the source and an identification of the types of emission points within the affected source subject to the relevant standard and types of hazardous air pollutants emitted; and
              (v) A statement of whether the affected source is a major source or an area source.
              (3) [Reserved]
              (4) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed major affected source for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is required under § 63.5(d) must provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:
              (i) A notification of intention to construct a new major-emitting affected source, reconstruct a major-emitting affected source, or reconstruct a major source such that the source becomes a major-emitting affected source with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(i); and
              (ii)-(iv) [Reserved]
              (v) A notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.
              (5) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is not required under § 63.5(d) must provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:
              (i) A notification of intention to construct a new affected source, reconstruct an affected source, or reconstruct a source such that the source becomes an affected source, and
              (ii) A notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.

              (iii) Unless the owner or operator has requested and received prior permission from the Administrator to submit less than the information in § 63.5(d), the notification must include the information required on the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(i).
              (c) Request for extension of compliance. If the owner or operator of an affected source cannot comply with a relevant standard by the applicable compliance date for that source, or if the owner or operator has installed BACT or technology to meet LAER consistent with § 63.6(i)(5) of this subpart, he/she may submit to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a request for an extension of compliance as specified in § 63.6(i)(4) through § 63.6(i)(6).
              (d) Notification that source is subject to special compliance requirements. An owner or operator of a new source that is subject to special compliance requirements as specified in § 63.6(b)(3) and § 63.6(b)(4) shall notify the Administrator of his/her compliance obligations not later than the notification dates established in paragraph (b) of this section for new sources that are not subject to the special provisions.
              (e) Notification of performance test. The owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to conduct a performance test at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to begin to allow the Administrator to review and approve the site-specific test plan required under § 63.7(c), if requested by the Administrator, and to have an observer present during the test.
              (f) Notification of opacity and visible emission observations. The owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator in writing of the anticipated date for conducting the opacity or visible emission observations specified in § 63.6(h)(5), if such observations are required for the source by a relevant standard. The notification shall be submitted with the notification of the performance test date, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, or if no performance test is required or visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 63.7, the owner or operator shall deliver or postmark the notification not less than 30 days before the opacity or visible emission observations are scheduled to take place.
              (g) Additional notification requirements for sources with continuous monitoring systems. The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a CMS by a relevant standard shall furnish the Administrator written notification as follows:
              (1) A notification of the date the CMS performance evaluation under § 63.8(e) is scheduled to begin, submitted simultaneously with the notification of the performance test date required under § 63.7(b). If no performance test is required, or if the requirement to conduct a performance test has been waived for an affected source under § 63.7(h), the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing of the date of the performance evaluation at least 60 calendar days before the evaluation is scheduled to begin;
              (2) A notification that COMS data results will be used to determine compliance with the applicable opacity emission standard during a performance test required by § 63.7 in lieu of Method 9 or other opacity emissions test method data, as allowed by § 63.6(h)(7)(ii), if compliance with an opacity emission standard is required for the source by a relevant standard. The notification shall be submitted at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to begin; and
              (3) A notification that the criterion necessary to continue use of an alternative to relative accuracy testing, as provided by § 63.8(f)(6), has been exceeded. The notification shall be delivered or postmarked not later than 10 days after the occurrence of such exceedance, and it shall include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions.
              (h) Notification of compliance status. (1) The requirements of paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(4) of this section apply when an affected source becomes subject to a relevant standard.

              (2)(i) Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, and each time a notification of compliance status is required under this part, the owner or operator of such source shall submit to the Administrator a notification of compliance status, signed by the responsible official who shall certify its accuracy, attesting to whether the source has complied with the relevant standard. The notification shall list—
              (A) The methods that were used to determine compliance;
              (B) The results of any performance tests, opacity or visible emission observations, continuous monitoring system (CMS) performance evaluations, and/or other monitoring procedures or methods that were conducted;
              (C) The methods that will be used for determining continuing compliance, including a description of monitoring and reporting requirements and test methods;
              (D) The type and quantity of hazardous air pollutants emitted by the source (or surrogate pollutants if specified in the relevant standard), reported in units and averaging times and in accordance with the test methods specified in the relevant standard;
              (E) If the relevant standard applies to both major and area sources, an analysis demonstrating whether the affected source is a major source (using the emissions data generated for this notification);
              (F) A description of the air pollution control equipment (or method) for each emission point, including each control device (or method) for each hazardous air pollutant and the control efficiency (percent) for each control device (or method); and
              (G) A statement by the owner or operator of the affected existing, new, or reconstructed source as to whether the source has complied with the relevant standard or other requirements.
              (ii) The notification must be sent before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the relevant compliance demonstration activity specified in the relevant standard (unless a different reporting period is specified in the standard, in which case the letter must be sent before the close of business on the day the report of the relevant testing or monitoring results is required to be delivered or postmarked). For example, the notification shall be sent before close of business on the 60th (or other required) day following completion of the initial performance test and again before the close of business on the 60th (or other required) day following the completion of any subsequent required performance test. If no performance test is required but opacity or visible emission observations are required to demonstrate compliance with an opacity or visible emission standard under this part, the notification of compliance status shall be sent before close of business on the 30th day following the completion of opacity or visible emission observations. Notifications may be combined as long as the due date requirement for each notification is met.
              (3) After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator of such source shall comply with all requirements for compliance status reports contained in the source's title V permit, including reports required under this part. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, and each time a notification of compliance status is required under this part, the owner or operator of such source shall submit the notification of compliance status to the appropriate permitting authority following completion of the relevant compliance demonstration activity specified in the relevant standard.
              (4) [Reserved]
              (5) If an owner or operator of an affected source submits estimates or preliminary information in the application for approval of construction or reconstruction required in § 63.5(d) in place of the actual emissions data or control efficiencies required in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(H) and (d)(2) of § 63.5, the owner or operator shall submit the actual emissions data and other correct information as soon as available but no later than with the initial notification of compliance status required in this section.
              (6) Advice on a notification of compliance status may be obtained from the Administrator.
              (i) Adjustment to time periods or postmark deadlines for submittal and review of required communications. (1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
              (ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this part.
              (2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
              (3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.
              (4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.
              (j) Change in information already provided. Any change in the information already provided under this section shall be provided to the Administrator in writing within 15 calendar days after the change.

              (4)(i) Before a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce recordkeeping and reporting requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit reports to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA (to the attention of the Director of the Division indicated in the list of the EPA Regional Offices in § 63.13).
              (ii) After a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce recordkeeping and reporting requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit reports to the delegated State authority (which may be the same as the permitting authority). In addition, if the delegated (permitting) authority is the State, the owner or operator shall send a copy of each report submitted to the State to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA, as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Regional Office may waive this requirement for any reports at its discretion.

              (5) If an owner or operator of an affected source in a State with delegated authority is required to submit periodic reports under this part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission of periodic reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) specified for such source under this part, the owner or operator may change the dates by which periodic reports under this part shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the State. For each relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act, the allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the affected source's compliance date for that standard. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
              (6) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by more than one standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State permitting authority) a common schedule on which periodic reports required for each source shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the latest compliance date for any relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for any such affected source(s). Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
              (7) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by standards established pursuant to section 112 of the Act (as amended November 15, 1990) and standards set under part 60, part 61, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State permitting authority) a common schedule on which periodic reports required by each relevant (i.e., applicable) standard shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the relevant section 112 standard, or 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the applicable part 60 or part 61 standard, whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
              (b) General recordkeeping requirements. (1) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by this part recorded in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious inspection and review. The files shall be retained for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. At a minimum, the most recent 2 years of data shall be retained on site. The remaining 3 years of data may be retained off site. Such files may be maintained on microfilm, on a computer, on computer floppy disks, on magnetic tape disks, or on microfiche.
              (2) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain relevant records for such source of—
              (i) The occurrence and duration of each startup or shutdown when the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards;
              (ii) The occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (i.e., process equipment) or the required air pollution control and monitoring equipment;
              (iii) All required maintenance performed on the air pollution control and monitoring equipment;
              (iv)(A) Actions taken during periods of startup or shutdown when the source exceeded applicable emission limitations in a relevant standard and when the actions taken are different from the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)); or
              (B) Actions taken during periods of malfunction (including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation) when the actions taken are different from the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3));

              (v) All information necessary, including actions taken, to demonstrate conformance with the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)) when all actions taken during periods of startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), and malfunction (including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation) are consistent with the procedures specified in such plan. (The information needed to demonstrate conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan may be recorded using a “checklist,” or some other effective form of recordkeeping, in order to minimize the recordkeeping burden for conforming events);
              (vi) Each period during which a CMS is malfunctioning or inoperative (including out-of-control periods);
              (vii) All required measurements needed to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard (including, but not limited to, 15-minute averages of CMS data, raw performance testing measurements, and raw performance evaluation measurements, that support data that the source is required to report);
              (A) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the reportable form of the standard.
              (B) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the Administrator.
              (C) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all measurements as required by paragraph (b)(2)(vii), if the administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected source.
              (viii) All results of performance tests, CMS performance evaluations, and opacity and visible emission observations;
              (ix) All measurements as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests and performance evaluations;
              (x) All CMS calibration checks;
              (xi) All adjustments and maintenance performed on CMS;
              (xii) Any information demonstrating whether a source is meeting the requirements for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this part, if the source has been granted a waiver under paragraph (f) of this section;
              (xiii) All emission levels relative to the criterion for obtaining permission to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test, if the source has been granted such permission under § 63.8(f)(6); and
              (xiv) All documentation supporting initial notifications and notifications of compliance status under § 63.9.
              (3) Recordkeeping requirement for applicability determinations. If an owner or operator determines that his or her stationary source that emits (or has the potential to emit, without considering controls) one or more hazardous air pollutants regulated by any standard established pursuant to section 112(d) or (f), and that stationary source is in the source category regulated by the relevant standard, but that source is not subject to the relevant standard (or other requirement established under this part) because of limitations on the source's potential to emit or an exclusion, the owner or operator must keep a record of the applicability determination on site at the source for a period of 5 years after the determination, or until the source changes its operations to become an affected source, whichever comes first. The record of the applicability determination must be signed by the person making the determination and include an analysis (or other information) that demonstrates why the owner or operator believes the source is unaffected (e.g., because the source is an area source). The analysis (or other information) must be sufficiently detailed to allow the Administrator to make a finding about the source's applicability status with regard to the relevant standard or other requirement. If relevant, the analysis must be performed in accordance with requirements established in relevant subparts of this part for this purpose for particular categories of stationary sources. If relevant, the analysis should be performed in accordance with EPA guidance materials published to assist sources in making applicability determinations under section 112, if any. The requirements to determine applicability of a standard under § 63.1(b)(3) and to record the results of that determination under paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not by themselves create an obligation for the owner or operator to obtain a title V permit.
              (c) Additional recordkeeping requirements for sources with continuous monitoring systems. In addition to complying with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard shall maintain records for such source of—
              (1) All required CMS measurements (including monitoring data recorded during unavoidable CMS breakdowns and out-of-control periods);
              (2)-(4) [Reserved]
              (5) The date and time identifying each period during which the CMS was inoperative except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks;
              (6) The date and time identifying each period during which the CMS was out of control, as defined in § 63.8(c)(7);
              (7) The specific identification (i.e., the date and time of commencement and completion) of each period of excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances, as defined in the relevant standard(s), that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the affected source;
              (8) The specific identification (i.e., the date and time of commencement and completion) of each time period of excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances, as defined in the relevant standard(s), that occurs during periods other than startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the affected source;
              (9) [Reserved]
              (10) The nature and cause of any malfunction (if known);
              (11) The corrective action taken or preventive measures adopted;
              (12) The nature of the repairs or adjustments to the CMS that was inoperative or out of control;
              (13) The total process operating time during the reporting period; and
              (14) All procedures that are part of a quality control program developed and implemented for CMS under § 63.8(d).
              (15) In order to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(10) through (c)(12) of this section and to avoid duplicative recordkeeping efforts, the owner or operator may use the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan or records kept to satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan specified in § 63.6(e), provided that such plan and records adequately address the requirements of paragraphs (c)(10) through (c)(12).
              (d) General reporting requirements. (1) Notwithstanding the requirements in this paragraph or paragraph (e) of this section, and except as provided in § 63.16, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to reporting requirements under this part shall submit reports to the Administrator in accordance with the reporting requirements in the relevant standard(s).
              (2) Reporting results of performance tests. Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall report the results of any performance test under § 63.7 to the Administrator. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall report the results of a required performance test to the appropriate permitting authority. The owner or operator of an affected source shall report the results of the performance test to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the performance test, unless specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as approved otherwise in writing by the Administrator. The results of the performance test shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required under § 63.9(h).
              (3) Reporting results of opacity or visible emission observations. The owner or operator of an affected source required to conduct opacity or visible emission observations by a relevant standard shall report the opacity or visible emission results (produced using Test Method 9 or Test Method 22, or an alternative to these test methods) along with the results of the performance test required under § 63.7. If no performance test is required, or if visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the performance test required under § 63.7, the owner or operator shall report the opacity or visible emission results before the close of business on the 30th day following the completion of the opacity or visible emission observations.
              (4) Progress reports. The owner or operator of an affected source who is required to submit progress reports as a condition of receiving an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i) shall submit such reports to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) by the dates specified in the written extension of compliance.
              (5)(i) Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports. If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction of an affected source (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)), the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. Actions taken to minimize emissions during such startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions shall be summarized in the report and may be done in checklist form; if actions taken are the same for each event, only one checklist is necessary. Such a report shall also include the number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. Reports shall only be required if a startup or shutdown caused the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards, or if a malfunction occurred during the reporting period. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall consist of a letter, containing the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, that shall be submitted to the Administrator semiannually (or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the source's title V permit). The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate). If the owner or operator is required to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (or other periodic) reports under this part, the startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports required under this paragraph may be submitted simultaneously with the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (or other) reports. If startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports are submitted with excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (or other periodic) reports, and the owner or operator receives approval to reduce the frequency of reporting for the latter under paragraph (e) of this section, the frequency of reporting for the startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports also may be reduced if the Administrator does not object to the intended change. The procedures to implement the allowance in the preceding sentence shall be the same as the procedures specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
              (ii) Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports. Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup or shutdown that caused the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii) shall consist of a telephone call (or facsimile (FAX) transmission) to the Administrator within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, and it shall be followed by a letter, delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event, that contains the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, describing all excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances which are believed to have occurred (or could have occurred in the case of malfunctions), and actions taken to minimize emissions in conformance with § 63.6(e)(1)(i). Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii) are specified in § 63.9(i).
              (e) Additional reporting requirements for sources with continuous monitoring systems—(1) General. When more than one CEMS is used to measure the emissions from one affected source (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each CEMS.
              (2) Reporting results of continuous monitoring system performance evaluations. (i) The owner or operator of an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard shall furnish the Administrator a copy of a written report of the results of the CMS performance evaluation, as required under § 63.8(e), simultaneously with the results of the performance test required under § 63.7, unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard.
              (ii) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS to determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under § 63.7 and described in § 63.6(d)(6) shall furnish the Administrator two or, upon request, three copies of a written report of the results of the COMS performance evaluation conducted under § 63.8(e). The copies shall be furnished at least 15 calendar days before the performance test required under § 63.7 is conducted.
              (3) Excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report and summary report. (i) Excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances are defined in relevant standards. The owner or operator of an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report and/or a summary report to the Administrator semiannually, except when—
              (A) More frequent reporting is specifically required by a relevant standard;
              (B) The Administrator determines on a case-by-case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source; or
              (C) [Reserved]
              
              (D) The affected source is complying with the Performance Track Provisions of § 63.16, which allows less frequent reporting.
              (ii) Request to reduce frequency of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports. Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator who is required by a relevant standard to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) reports on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:
              (A) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods) the affected source's excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports continually demonstrate that the source is in compliance with the relevant standard;
              (B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and the relevant standard; and
              (C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of reporting for the affected source, as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
              (iii) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) reports required to comply with a relevant standard may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.
              (iv) As soon as CMS data indicate that the source is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter specified in the relevant standard, the frequency of reporting shall revert to the frequency specified in the relevant standard, and the owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) report for the noncomplying emission points at the next appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant standard for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard, as provided for in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
              (v) Content and submittal dates for excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports. All excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports and all summary reports, if required, shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half or quarter, as appropriate. Written reports of excess emissions or exceedances of process or control system parameters shall include all the information required in paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(13) of this section, in §§ 63.8(c)(7) and 63.8(c)(8), and in the relevant standard, and they shall contain the name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report. When no excess emissions or exceedances of a parameter have occurred, or a CMS has not been inoperative, out of control, repaired, or adjusted, such information shall be stated in the report.
              (vi) Summary report. As required under paragraphs (e)(3)(vii) and (e)(3)(viii) of this section, one summary report shall be submitted for the hazardous air pollutants monitored at each affected source (unless the relevant standard specifies that more than one summary report is required, e.g., one summary report for each hazardous air pollutant monitored). The summary report shall be entitled “Summary Report—Gaseous and Opacity Excess Emission and Continuous Monitoring System Performance” and shall contain the following information:
              (A) The company name and address of the affected source;
              (B) An identification of each hazardous air pollutant monitored at the affected source;
              (C) The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;
              (D) A brief description of the process units;
              (E) The emission and operating parameter limitations specified in the relevant standard(s);
              (F) The monitoring equipment manufacturer(s) and model number(s);
              (G) The date of the latest CMS certification or audit;
              (H) The total operating time of the affected source during the reporting period;
              (I) An emission data summary (or similar summary if the owner or operator monitors control system parameters), including the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of excess emissions expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period into those that are due to startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes;
              (J) A CMS performance summary (or similar summary if the owner or operator monitors control system parameters), including the total CMS downtime during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of CMS downtime expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total CMS downtime during the reporting period into periods that are due to monitoring equipment malfunctions, nonmonitoring equipment malfunctions, quality assurance/quality control calibrations, other known causes, and other unknown causes;
              (K) A description of any changes in CMS, processes, or controls since the last reporting period;
              (L) The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report; and
              (M) The date of the report.
              (vii) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is less than 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, and CMS downtime for the reporting period is less than 5 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, only the summary report shall be submitted, and the full excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report need not be submitted unless required by the Administrator.
              (viii) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, or the total CMS downtime for the reporting period is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, both the summary report and the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report shall be submitted.
              (4) Reporting continuous opacity monitoring system data produced during a performance test. The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a COMS shall record the monitoring data produced during a performance test required under § 63.7 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results. The report of COMS data shall be submitted simultaneously with the report of the performance test results required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
              (f) Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements. (1) Until a waiver of a recordkeeping or reporting requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.
              (2) Recordkeeping or reporting requirements may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the affected source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or the source is operating under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
              (3) If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i), any required compliance progress report or compliance status report required under this part (such as under §§ 63.6(i) and 63.9(h)) or in the source's title V permit, or an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required under paragraph (e) of this section, whichever is applicable. The application shall include whatever information the owner or operator considers useful to convince the Administrator that a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is warranted.
              (4) The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this paragraph when he/she—
              (i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance; or
              (ii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
              (iii) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
              (5) A waiver of any recordkeeping or reporting requirement granted under this paragraph may be conditioned on other recordkeeping or reporting requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator.
              (6) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.

              (3) This section also contains requirements for an alternative work practice used to identify leaking equipment. This alternative work practice is placed here for administrative convenience and is available to all subparts in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that require monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (b) Flares. (1) Owners or operators using flares to comply with the provisions of this part shall monitor these control devices to assure that they are operated and maintained in conformance with their designs. Applicable subparts will provide provisions stating how owners or operators using flares shall monitor these control devices.
              (2) Flares shall be steam-assisted, air-assisted, or non-assisted.
              (3) Flares shall be operated at all times when emissions may be vented to them.
              (4) Flares shall be designed for and operated with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours. Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter shall be used to determine the compliance of flares with the visible emission provisions of this part. The observation period is 2 hours and shall be used according to Method 22.

              (5) Flares shall be operated with a flame present at all times. The presence of a flare pilot flame shall be monitored using a thermocouple or any other equivalent device to detect the presence of a flame.
              (6) An owner/operator has the choice of adhering to the heat content specifications in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, and the maximum tip velocity specifications in paragraph (b)(7) or (b)(8) of this section, or adhering to the requirements in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.

              Vmax = (XH2−K1)* K2
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec.
                K1 = Constant, 6.0 volume-percent hydrogen.
                K2 = Constant, 3.9(m/sec)/volume-percent hydrogen.
                XH2 = The volume-percent of hydrogen, on a wet basis, as calculated by using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method D1946-77. (Incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14).
              
              
              (B) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by the method specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section.
              (ii) Flares shall be used only with the net heating value of the gas being combusted at 11.2 MJ/scm (300 Btu/scf) or greater if the flare is steam-assisted or air-assisted; or with the net heating value of the gas being combusted at 7.45 M/scm (200 Btu/scf) or greater if the flares is non-assisted. The net heating value of the gas being combusted in a flare shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER04MY98.004
              
              
                Where:
                
                HT = Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm; where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C.
                K = Constant =
              
              
                ER04MY98.005

                Ci = Concentration of sample component i in ppmv on a wet basis, as measured for organics by Test Method 18 and measured for hydrogen and carbon monoxide by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14).
                Hi = Net heat of combustion of sample component i, kcal/g-mole at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg. The heats of combustion may be determined using ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14) if published values are not available or cannot be calculated.
                n = Number of sample components.
              
              
              (7)(i) Steam-assisted and nonassisted flares shall be designed for and operated with an exit velocity less than 18.3 m/sec (60 ft/sec), except as provided in paragraphs (b)(7)(ii) and (b)(7)(iii) of this section. The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by dividing by the volumetric flow rate of gas being combusted (in units of emission standard temperature and pressure), as determined by Test Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 of this chapter, as appropriate, by the unobstructed (free) cross-sectional area of the flare tip.
              (ii) Steam-assisted and nonassisted flares designed for and operated with an exit velocity, as determined by the method specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, equal to or greater than 18.3 m/sec (60 ft/sec) but less than 122 m/sec (400 ft/sec), are allowed if the net heating value of the gas being combusted is greater than 37.3 MJ/scm (1,000 Btu/scf).

              (iii) Steam-assisted and nonassisted flares designed for and operated with an exit velocity, as determined by the method specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, less than the velocity Vmax, as determined by the method specified in this paragraph, but less than 122 m/sec (400 ft/sec) are allowed. The maximum permitted velocity, Vmax, for flares complying with this paragraph shall be determined by the following equation:
              
              Log10(Vmax) = (HT + 28.8)/31.7
              
              
                
                Where:
                
                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec.
                28.8 = Constant.
                31.7 = Constant.
                HT = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
              
              

              (8) Air-assisted flares shall be designed and operated with an exit velocity less than the velocity Vmax. The maximum permitted velocity, Vmax, for air-assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation:
              
              Vmax = 8.71 + 0.708(HT)
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec.
                8.71 = Constant.
                0.708 = Constant.
                HT = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
              
              (c) Alternative work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks. Paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply to all equipment for which the applicable subpart requires monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor, except for closed vent systems, equipment designated as leakless, and equipment identified in the applicable subpart as having no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background. An owner or operator may use an optical gas imaging instrument instead of a 40 CFR part 60, sppendix A-7, Method 21 monitor. Requirements in the existing subparts that are specific to the Method 21 instrument do not apply under this section. All other requirements in the applicable subpart that are not addressed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section continue to apply. For example, equipment specification requirements, and non-Method 21 instrument recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the applicable subpart continue to apply. The terms defined in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section have meanings that are specific to the alternative work practice standard in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
              (1) Applicable subpart means the subpart in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that requires monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (2) Equipment means pumps, valves, pressure relief valves, compressors, open-ended lines, flanges, connectors, and other equipment covered by the applicable subpart that require monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (3) Imaging means making visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
              (4) Optical gas imaging instrument means an instrument that makes visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
              (5) Repair means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, in order to eliminate a leak.
              (6) Leak means:
              (i) Any emissions imaged by the optical gas instrument;
              (ii) Indications of liquids dripping;
              (iii) Indications by a sensor that a seal or barrier fluid system has failed; or
              (iv) Screening results using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor that exceed the leak definition in the applicable subpart to which the equipment is subject.
              (d) The alternative work practice standard for monitoring equipment for leaks is available to all subparts in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that require monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (1) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, or 65 can choose to comply with the alternative work practice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section instead of using the 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor to identify leaking equipment. The owner or operator must document the equipment, process units, and facilities for which the alternative work practice will be used to identify leaks.
              (2) Any leak detected when following the leak survey procedure in paragraph (e)(3) of this section must be identified for repair as required in the applicable subpart.

              (3) If the alternative work practice is used to identify leaks, re-screening after an attempted repair of leaking equipment must be conducted using either the alternative work practice or the 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subparts to which the equipment is subject.
              (4) The schedule for repair is as required in the applicable subpart.
              (5) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, choose one of the monitoring frequencies listed in Table 1 to subpart A of this part in lieu of the monitoring frequency specified for regulated equipment in the applicable subpart. Reduced monitoring frequencies for good performance are not applicable when using the alternative work practice.
              (6) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, the following are not applicable for the equipment being monitored:
              (i) Skip period leak detection and repair;
              (ii) Quality improvement plans; or
              (iii) Complying with standards for allowable percentage of valves and pumps to leak.
              (7) When the alternative work practice is used to detect leaking equipment, the regulated equipment in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section must also be monitored annually using a 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator may choose the specific monitoring period (for example, first quarter) to conduct the annual monitoring. Subsequent monitoring must be conducted every 12 months from the initial period. Owners or operators must keep records of the annual Method 21 screening results, as specified in paragraph (i)(4)(vii) of this section.
              (e) An owner or operator of an affected source who chooses to use the alternative work practice must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.
              (1) Instrument specifications. The optical gas imaging instrument must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Provide the operator with an image of the potential leak points for each piece of equipment at both the detection sensitivity level and within the distance used in the daily instrument check described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The detection sensitivity level depends upon the frequency at which leak monitoring is to be performed.
              (ii) Provide a date and time stamp for video records of every monitoring event.
              (2) Daily instrument check. On a daily basis, and prior to beginning any leak monitoring work, test the optical gas imaging instrument at the mass flow rate determined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) through (e)(2)(iv) of this section for each camera configuration used during monitoring (for example, different lenses used), unless an alternative method to demonstrate daily instrument checks has been approved in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section.
              (i) Calculate the mass flow rate to be used in the daily instrument check by following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
              (A) For a specified population of equipment to be imaged by the instrument, determine the piece of equipment in contact with the lowest mass fraction of chemicals that are detectable, within the distance to be used in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, at or below the standard detection sensitivity level.
              (B) Multiply the standard detection sensitivity level, corresponding to the selected monitoring frequency in Table 1 of subpart A of this part, by the mass fraction of detectable chemicals from the stream identified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section to determine the mass flow rate to be used in the daily instrument check, using the following equation.
              
                ER22DE08.008
              
              
                Where:
                
                Edic = Mass flow rate for the daily instrument check, grams per hour
                xi = Mass fraction of detectable chemical(s) i seen by the optical gas imaging instrument, within the distance to be used in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, at or below the standard detection sensitivity level, Esds.
                
                Esds = Standard detection sensitivity level from Table 1 to subpart A, grams per hour
                k = Total number of detectable chemicals emitted from the leaking equipment and seen by the optical gas imaging instrument.
              
              
              (ii) Start the optical gas imaging instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that all appropriate settings conform to the manufacturer's instructions.
              (iii) Use any gas chosen by the user that can be viewed by the optical gas imaging instrument and that has a purity of no less than 98 percent.
              (iv) Establish a mass flow rate by using the following procedures:
              (A) Provide a source of gas where it will be in the field of view of the optical gas imaging instrument.
              (B) Set up the optical gas imaging instrument at a recorded distance from the outlet or leak orifice of the flow meter that will not be exceeded in the actual performance of the leak survey. Do not exceed the operating parameters of the flow meter.
              (C) Open the valve on the flow meter to set a flow rate that will create a mass emission rate equal to the mass rate calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section while observing the gas flow through the optical gas imaging instrument viewfinder. When an image of the gas emission is seen through the viewfinder at the required emission rate, make a record of the reading on the flow meter.
              (v) Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) through (e)(2)(iv) of this section for each configuration of the optical gas imaging instrument used during the leak survey.
              (vi) To use an alternative method to demonstrate daily instrument checks, apply to the Administrator for approval of the alternative under § 63.177 or § 63.178, whichever is applicable.
              (3) Leak survey procedure. Operate the optical gas imaging instrument to image every regulated piece of equipment selected for this work practice in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's operating parameters. All emissions imaged by the optical gas imaging instrument are considered to be leaks and are subject to repair. All emissions visible to the naked eye are also considered to be leaks and are subject to repair.
              (4) Recordkeeping. Keep the records described in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(vii) of this section:
              (i) The equipment, processes, and facilities for which the owner or operator chooses to use the alternative work practice.
              (ii) The detection sensitivity level selected from Table 1 to subpart A of this part for the optical gas imaging instrument.
              (iii) The analysis to determine the piece of equipment in contact with the lowest mass fraction of chemicals that are detectable, as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
              (iv) The technical basis for the mass fraction of detectable chemicals used in the equation in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
              (v) The daily instrument check. Record the distance, per paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, and the flow meter reading, per paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, at which the leak was imaged. Keep a video record of the daily instrument check for each configuration of the optical gas imaging instrument used during the leak survey (for example, the daily instrument check must be conducted for each lens used). The video record must include a time and date stamp for each daily instrument check. The video record must be kept for 5 years.
              (vi) Recordkeeping requirements in the applicable subpart. A video record must be used to document the leak survey results. The video record must include a time and date stamp for each monitoring event. A video record can be used to meet the recordkeeping requirements of the applicable subparts if each piece of regulated equipment selected for this work practice can be identified in the video record. The video record must be kept for 5 years.

              (vii) The results of the annual Method 21 screening required in paragraph (h)(7) of this section. Records must be kept for all regulated equipment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Records must identify the equipment screened, the screening value measured by Method 21, the time and date of the screening, and calibration information required in the existing applicable subparts.
              (5) Reporting. Submit the reports required in the applicable subpart. Submit the records of the annual Method 21 screening required in paragraph (h)(7) of this section to the Administrator via e-mail to CCG-AWP@EPA.GOV.

              § 63.12
              State authority and delegations.
              (a) The provisions of this part shall not be construed in any manner to preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from—
              (1) Adopting and enforcing any standard, limitation, prohibition, or other regulation applicable to an affected source subject to the requirements of this part, provided that such standard, limitation, prohibition, or regulation is not less stringent than any requirement applicable to such source established under this part;
              (2) Requiring the owner or operator of an affected source to obtain permits, licenses, or approvals prior to initiating construction, reconstruction, modification, or operation of such source; or
              (3) Requiring emission reductions in excess of those specified in subpart D of this part as a condition for granting the extension of compliance authorized by section 112(i)(5) of the Act.
              (b)(1) Section 112(l) of the Act directs the Administrator to delegate to each State, when appropriate, the authority to implement and enforce standards and other requirements pursuant to section 112 for stationary sources located in that State. Because of the unique nature of radioactive material, delegation of authority to implement and enforce standards that control radionuclides may require separate approval.
              (2) Subpart E of this part establishes procedures consistent with section 112(l) for the approval of State rules or programs to implement and enforce applicable Federal rules promulgated under the authority of section 112. Subpart E also establishes procedures for the review and withdrawal of section 112 implementation and enforcement authorities granted through a section 112(l) approval.
              (c) All information required to be submitted to the EPA under this part also shall be submitted to the appropriate State agency of any State to which authority has been delegated under section 112(l) of the Act, provided that each specific delegation may exempt sources from a certain Federal or State reporting requirement. The Administrator may permit all or some of the information to be submitted to the appropriate State agency only, instead of to the EPA and the State agency.

                Construct a major source means:
              (1) To fabricate, erect, or install at any greenfield site a stationary source or group of stationary sources which is located within a contiguous area and under common control and which emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of any HAP's or 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP, or
              (2) To fabricate, erect, or install at any developed site a new process or production unit which in and of itself emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP, unless the process or production unit satisfies criteria in paragraphs (2) (i) through (vi) of this definition.
              (i) All HAP emitted by the process or production unit that would otherwise be controlled under the requirements of this subpart will be controlled by emission control equipment which was previously installed at the same site as the process or production unit;
              (ii) (A) The permitting authority has determined within a period of 5 years prior to the fabrication, erection, or installation of the process or production unit that the existing emission control equipment represented best available control technology (BACT), lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) under 40 CFR part 51 or 52, toxics—best available control technology (T-BACT), or MACT based on State air toxic rules for the category of pollutants which includes those HAP's to be emitted by the process or production unit; or

              (B) The permitting authority determines that the control of HAP emissions provided by the existing equipment will be equivalent to that level of control currently achieved by other well-controlled similar sources (i.e., equivalent to the level of control that would be provided by a current BACT, LAER, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination);
              (iii) The permitting authority determines that the percent control efficiency for emissions of HAP from all sources to be controlled by the existing control equipment will be equivalent to the percent control efficiency provided by the control equipment prior to the inclusion of the new process or production unit;
              (iv) The permitting authority has provided notice and an opportunity for public comment concerning its determination that criteria in paragraphs (2)(i), (2)(ii), and (2)(iii) of this definition apply and concerning the continued adequacy of any prior LAER, BATC, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination;
              (v) If any commenter has asserted that a prior LAER, BACT, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination is no longer adequate, the permitting authority has determined that the level of control required by that prior determination remains adequate; and
              (vi) Any emission limitations, work practice requirements, or other terms and conditions upon which the above determinations by the permitting authority are applicable requirements under section 504(a) and either have been incorporated into any existing title V permit for the affected facility or will be incorporated into such permit upon issuance.
              
                Control technology means measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques to limit the emission of hazardous air pollutants through process changes, substitution of materials or other modifications;
              (1) Reduce the quantity of, or eliminate emissions of, such pollutants through process changes, substitution of materials or other modifications;
              (2) Enclose systems or processes to eliminate emissions;
              (3) Collect, capture or treat such pollutants when released from a process, stack, storage or fugitive emissions point;
              (4) Are design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (including requirements for operator training or certification) as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7412(h); or
              (5) Are a combination of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition.
              
                Effective date of section 112(g)(2)(B) in a State or local jurisdiction means the effective date specified by the permitting authority at the time the permitting authority adopts a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction or major sources of HAP, or June 29, 1998 whichever is earlier.
              
                Electric utility steam generating unit means any fossil fuel fired combustion unit of more than 25 megawatts that serves a generator that produces electricity for sale. A unit that co-generates steam and electricity and supplies more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 megawatts electric output to any utility power distribution system for sale shall be considered an electric utility steam generating unit.

              § 63.42
              Program requirements governing construction or reconstruction of major sources.
              (a) Adoption of program. Each permitting authority shall review its existing programs, procedures, and criteria for preconstruction review for conformity to the requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, shall make any additions and revisions to its existing programs, procedures, and criteria that the permitting authority deems necessary to properly effectuate §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP. As part of the adoption by the permitting authority of a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP, the chief executive officer of the permitting authority shall certify that the program satisfies all applicable requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall specify an effective date for that program which is not later than June 29, 1998. Prior to the specified effective date, the permitting authority shall publish a notice stating that the permitting authority has adopted a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP and stating the effective date, and shall provide a written description of the program to the Administrator through the appropriate EPA Regional Office. Nothing in this section shall be construed either:
              (1) To require that any owner or operator of a stationary source comply with any requirement adopted by the permitting authority which is not intended to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP; or
              (2) To preclude the permitting authority from enforcing any requirements not intended to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP under any other provision of applicable law.
              (b) Failure to adopt program. In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is able to make case-by-case MACT determinations which conform to the provisions of § 63.43 in the absence of such a program, the permitting authority may elect to make such determinations. However, in those instances where the permitting authority elects to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP, no such case-by-case MACT determination shall take effect until after it has been submitted by the permitting authority in writing to the appropriate EPA Regional Adminstrator and the EPA Regional Administrator has concurred in writing that the case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority is in conformity with all requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44. In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is unable to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of such a program, the permitting authority may request that the EPA Regional Administrator implement a transitional program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP in the affected State of local jurisdiction while the permitting authority completes development and adoption of a section 112(g) program. Any such transitional section 112(g) program implemented by the EPA Regional Administrator shall conform to all requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall remain in effect for no more than 30 months. Continued failure by the permitting authority to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP shall be construed as a failure by the permitting authority to adequately administer and enforce its title V permitting program and shall constitute cause by EPA to apply the sanctions and remedies set forth in the Clean Air Act section 502(I).
              (c) Prohibition. After the effective date of section 112(g)(2)(B) (as defined in § 63.41) in a State or local jurisdiction and the effective date of the title V permit program applicable to that State or local jurisdiction, no person may begin actual construction or reconstruction of a major source of HAP in such State or local jurisdiction unless:
              (1) The major source in question has been specifically regulated or exempted from regulation under a standard issued pursuant to section 112(d), section 112(h) or section 112(j) in part 63, and the owner and operator has fully complied with all procedures and requirements for preconstruction review established by that standard, including any applicable requirements set forth in subpart A of this part 63; or
              (2) The permitting authority has made a final and effective case-by-case determination pursuant to the provisions of § 63.43 such that emissions from the constructed or reconstructed major source will be controlled to a level no less stringent than the maximum achievable control technology emission limitation for new sources.
              [61 FR 68400, Dec. 27, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 35032, June 30, 1999]
            
            
              § 63.43
              Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) determinations for constructed and reconstructed major sources.
              (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to an owner or operator who constructs or reconstructs a major source of HAP subject to a case-by-case determination of maximum achievable control technology pursuant to § 63.42(c).
              (b) Requirements for constructed and reconstructed major sources. When a case-by-case determination of MACT is required by § 63.42(c), the owner and operator shall obtain from the permitting authority an approved MACT determination according to one of the review options contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Review options. (1) When the permitting authority requires the owner or operator to obtain, or revise, a permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act before construction or reconstruction of the major source, or when the permitting authority allows the owner or operator at its discretion to obtain or revise such a permit before construction or reconstruction, and the owner or operator elects that option, the owner or operator shall follow the administrative procedures in the program approved under title V of the Act (or in other regulations issued pursuant to title V of the Act, where applicable).
              (2) When an owner or operator is not required to obtain or revise a title V permit (or other permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act) before construction or reconstruction, the owner or operator (unless the owner or operator voluntarily follows the process to obtain a title V permit) shall either, at the discretion of the permitting authority:
              (i) Apply for and obtain a Notice of MACT Approval according to the procedures outlined in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section; or
              (ii) Apply for a MACT determination under any other administrative procedures for preconstruction review and approval established by the permitting authority for a State or local jurisdiction which provide for public participation in the determination, and ensure that no person may begin actual construction or reconstruction of a major source in that State or local jurisdiction unless the permitting authority determines that the MACT emission limitation for new sources will be met.
              (3) When applying for a permit pursuant to title V of the Act, an owner or operator may request approval of case-by-case MACT determinations for alternative operating scenarios. Approval of such determinations satisfies the requirements of section 112(g) of each such scenario.
              (4) Regardless of the review process, the MACT emission limitation and requirements established shall be effective as required by paragraph (j) of this section, consistent with the principles established in paragraph (d) of this section, and supported by the information listed in paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, and with all applicable requirements in subpart A of this part.
              (d) Principles of MACT determinations. The following general principles shall govern preparation by the owner or operator of each permit application or other application requiring a case-by-case MACT determination concerning construction or reconstruction of a major source, and all subsequent review of and actions taken concerning such an application by the permitting authority:
              (1) The MACT emission limitation or MACT requirements recommended by the applicant and approved by the permitting authority shall not be less stringent than the emission control which is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the permitting authority.
              (2) Based upon available information, as defined in this subpart, the MACT emission limitation and control technology (including any requirements under paragraph (d)(3) of this section) recommended by the applicant and approved by the permitting authority shall achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP which can be achieved by utilizing those control technologies that can be identified from the available information, taking into consideration the costs of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements associated with the emission reduction.
              (3) The applicant may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or a combination thereof, and the permitting authority may approve such a standard if the permitting authority specifically determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission limitation under the criteria set forth in section 112(h)(2) of the Act.
              (4) If the Administrator has either proposed a relevant emission standard pursuant to section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or adopted a presumptive MACT determination for the source category which includes the constructed or reconstructed major source, then the MACT requirements applied to the constructed or reconstructed major source shall have considered those MACT emission limitations and requirements of the proposed standard or presumptive MACT determination.
              (e) Application requirements for a case-by-case MACT determination. (1) An application for a MACT determination (whether a permit application under title V of the Act, an application for a Notice of MACT Approval, or other document specified by the permitting authority under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall specify a control technology selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the MACT emission limitation or standard as determined according to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) In each instance where a constructed or reconstructed major source would require additional control technology or a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:
              (i) The name and address (physical location) of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed;
              (ii) A brief description of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed and identification of any listed source category or categories in which it is included;
              (iii) The expected commencement date for the construction or reconstruction of the major source;
              (iv) The expected completion date for construction or reconstruction of the major source;
              (v) the anticipated date of start-up for the constructed or reconstructed major source;
              (vi) The HAP emitted by the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the estimated emission rate for each such HAP, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;
              (vii) Any federally enforceable emission limitations applicable to the constructed or reconstructed major source;
              (viii) The maximum and expected utilization of capacity of the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the associated uncontrolled emission rates for that source, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;
              (ix) The controlled emissions for the constructed or reconstructed major source in tons/yr at expected and maximum utilization of capacity, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;
              (x) A recommended emission limitation for the constructed or reconstructed major source consistent with the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section;
              (xi) The selected control technology to meet the recommended MACT emission limitation, including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency of the control technology (and the manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and relevant specifications and drawings, if requested by the permitting authority);
              (xii) Supporting documentation including identification of alternative control technologies considered by the applicant to meet the emission limitation, and analysis of cost and non-air quality health environmental impacts or energy requirements for the selected control technology; and
              (xiii) Any other relevant information required pursuant to subpart A.
              (3) In each instance where the owner or operator contends that a constructed or reconstructed major source will be in compliance, upon startup, with case-by-case MACT under this subpart without a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:
              (i) The information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(x) of this section; and
              (ii) Documentation of the control technology in place.
              (f) Administrative procedures for review of the Notice of MACT Approval. (1) The permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing, within 45 days from the date the application is first received, as to whether the application for a MACT determination is complete or whether additional information is required.

              (2) The permitting authority will initially approve the recommended MACT emission limitation and other terms set forth in the application, or the permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing of its intent to disapprove the application, within 30 calendar days after the owner or operator is notified in writing that the application is complete.
              
              (3) The owner or operator may present, in writing, within 60 calendar days after receipt of notice of the permitting authority's intent to disapprove the application, additional information or arguments pertaining to, or amendments to, the application for consideration by the permitting authority before it decides whether to finally disapprove the application.
              (4) The permitting authority will either initially approve or issue a final disapproval of the application within 90 days after it notifies the owner or operator of an intent to disapprove or within 30 days after the date additional information is received from the owner or operator; whichever is earlier.
              (5) A final determination by the permitting authority to disapprove any application will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. If any application is finally disapproved, the owner or operator may submit a subsequent application concerning construction or reconstruction of the same major source, provided that the subsequent application has been amended in response to the stated grounds for the prior disapproval.
              (6) An initial decision to approve an application for a MACT determination will be set forth in the Notice of MACT Approval as described in paragraph (g) of this section.
              (g) Notice of MACT Approval. (1) The Notice of MACT Approval will contain a MACT emission limitation (or a MACT work practice standard if the permitting authority determines it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard) to control the emissions of HAP. The MACT emission limitation or standard will be determined by the permitting authority and will conform to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The Notice of MACT Approval will specify any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting and record keeping requirements. The Notice of MACT Approval shall include:
              (i) In addition to the MACT emission limitation or MACT work practice standard established under this subpart, additional emission limits, production limits, operational limits or other terms and conditions necessary to ensure Federal enforceability of the MACT emission limitation;
              (ii) Compliance certifications, testing, monitoring, reporting and record keeping requirements that are consistent with the requirements of § 70.6(c) of this chapter;
              (iii) In accordance with section 114(a)(3) of the Act, monitoring shall be capable of demonstrating continuous compliance during the applicable reporting period. Such monitoring data shall be of sufficient quality to be used as a basis for enforcing all applicable requirements established under this subpart, including emission limitations;
              (iv) A statement requiring the owner or operator to comply with all applicable requirements contained in subpart A of this part;
              (3) All provisions contained in the Notice of MACT Approval shall be federally enforceable upon the effective date of issuance of such notice, as provided by paragraph (j) of this section.
              (4) The Notice of MACT Approval shall expire if construction or reconstruction has not commenced within 18 months of issuance, unless the permitting authority has granted an extension which shall not exceed an additional 12 months.
              (h) Opportunity for public comment on the Notice of MACT Approval. (1) The permitting authority will provide opportunity for public comment on the Notice of MACT Approval, including, at a minimum:
              (i) Availability for public inspection in at least one location in the area affected of the information submitted by the owner or operator and of the permitting authority's initial decision to approve the application;
              (ii) A 30-day period for submittal of public comment; and
              (iii) A notice by prominent advertisement in the area affected of the location of the source information and initial decision specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.

              (2) At the discretion of the permitting authority, the Notice of MACT Approval setting forth the initial decision to approve the application may become final automatically at the end of the comment period if no adverse comments are received. If adverse comments are received, the permitting authority shall have 30 days after the end of the comment period to make any necessary revisions in its analysis and decide whether to finally approve the application.
              (i) EPA notification. The permitting authority shall send a copy of the final Notice of MACT Approval, notice of approval of a title V permit application incorporating a MACT determination (in those instances where the owner or operator either is required or elects to obtain such a permit before construction or reconstruction), or other notice of approval issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office, and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction in affected States.
              (j) Effective date. The effective date of a MACT determination shall be the date the Notice of MACT Approval becomes final, the date of issuance of a title V permit incorporating a MACT determination (in those instances where the owner or operator either is required or elects to obtain such a permit before construction or reconstruction), or the date any other notice of approval issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section becomes final.
              (k) Compliance date. On and after the date of start-up, a constructed or reconstructed major source which is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall be in compliance with all applicable requirements specified in the MACT determination.
              (l) Compliance with MACT determinations. (1) An owner or operator of a constructed or reconstructed major source that is subject to a MACT determination shall comply with all requirements in the final Notice of MACT Approval, the title V permit (in those instances where the owner or operator either is required or elects to obtain such a permit before construction or reconstruction), or any other final notice of approval issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, including but not limited to any MACT emission limitation or MACT work practice standard, and any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.
              (2) An owner or operator of a constructed or reconstructed major source which has obtained a MACT determination shall be deemed to be in compliance with section 112(g)(2)(B) of the Act only to the extent that the constructed or reconstructed major source is in compliance with all requirements set forth in the final Notice of MACT Approval, the title V permit (in those instances where the owner or operator either is required or elects to obtain such a permit before construction or reconstruction), or any other final notice of approval issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Any violation of such requirements by the owner or operator shall be deemed by the permitting authority and by EPA to be a violation of the prohibition on construction or reconstruction in section 112(g)(2)(B) for whatever period the owner or operator is determined to be in violation of such requirements, and shall subject the owner or operator to appropriate enforcement action under the Act.
              (m) Reporting to the Administrator. Within 60 days of the issuance of a final Notice of MACT Approval, a title V permit incorporating a MACT determination (in those instances where the owner or operator either is required or elects to obtain such a permit before construction or reconstruction), or any other final notice of approval issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the permitting authority shall provide a copy of such notice to the Administrator, and shall provide a summary in a compatible electronic format for inclusion in the MACT data base.

              § 63.44
              Requirements for constructed or reconstructed major sources subject to a subsequently promulgated MACT standard or MACT requirement.

              (a) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority issues a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which would be deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart before the date that the owner or operator has obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under any of the review options available pursuant to § 63.43, the owner or operator of the source(s) shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination rather than any MACT determination under section 112(g) by the permitting authority, and the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard.
              (b) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority makes a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and has been subject to a prior case-by-case MACT determination pursuant to § 63.43, and the owner and operator obtained a final and legally effective case-by-case MACT determination prior to the promulgation date of such emission standard, then the permitting authority shall (if the initial title V permit has not yet been issued) issue an initial operating permit which incorporates the emission standard or determination, or shall (if the initial title V permit has been issued) revise the operating permit according to the reopening procedures in 40 CFR part 70 or part 71, whichever is relevant, to incorporate the emission standard or determination.
              (1) The EPA may include in the emission standard established under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act a specific compliance date for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart and which have submitted the information required by § 63.43 to the EPA before the close of the public comment period for the standard established under section 112(d) of the Act. Such date shall assure that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated. In that event, the permitting authority shall incorporate the applicable compliance date in the title V operating permit.
              (2) If no compliance date has been established in the promulgated 112(d) or 112(h) standard or section 112(j) determination, for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart, then the permitting authority shall establish a compliance date in the permit that assures that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated or a section 112(j) determination is made.
              (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority issues a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and which is the subject of a prior case-by-case MACT determination pursuant to § 63.43, and the level of control required by the emission standard issued under section 112(d) or section 112(h) or the determination issued under section 112(j) is less stringent than the level of control required by any emission limitation or standard in the prior MACT determination, the permitting authority is not required to incorporate any less stringent terms of the promulgated standard in the title V operating permit applicable to such source(s) and may in its discretion consider any more stringent provisions of the prior MACT determination to be applicable legal requirements when issuing or revising such an operating permit.

              § 63.50
              Applicability.
              (a) General applicability. (1) The requirements of this section through § 63.56 implement section 112(j) of the Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990). The requirements of this section through § 63.56 apply in each State beginning on the effective date of an approved title V permit program in such State. The requirements of this section through § 63.56 do not apply to research or laboratory activities as defined in § 63.51.
              (2) The requirements of this section through § 63.56 apply to:
              (i) The owner or operator of affected sources within a source category or subcategory under this part that are located at a major source that is subject to an approved title V permit program and for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate emission standards by the section 112(j) deadlines. If title V applicability has been deferred for a source category, then section 112(j) is not applicable for sources in that category within that State, local or tribal jurisdiction until those sources become subject to title V permitting requirements; and
              (ii) Permitting authorities with an approved title V permit program.
              (b) Relationship to State and local requirements. Nothing in §§ 63.50 through 63.56 shall prevent a State or local regulatory agency from imposing more stringent requirements, as a matter of State or local law, than those contained in §§ 63.50 through 63.56.
              (c) The procedures in §§ 63.50 through 63.56 apply for each affected source only after the section 112(j) deadline for the source category or subcategory in question has passed, and only until such time as a generally applicable Federal standard governing that source has been promulgated under section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act. Once a generally applicable Federal standard governing that source has been promulgated, the owner or operator of the affected source and the permitting authority are not required to take any further actions to develop an equivalent emission limitation under section 112(j) of the Act.
              (d) Any final equivalent emission limitation for an affected source which is issued by the permitting authority pursuant to §§ 63.50 through 63.56 prior to promulgation of a generally applicable Federal standard governing that source under section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act shall be deemed an applicable Federal requirement adopted pursuant to section 112(j) of the Act. Each such equivalent emission limitation shall take effect upon issuance of the permit containing that limitation under section 112(j)(5) of the Act, and shall remain applicable to the source until such time as it may be revised or supplanted pursuant to the procedures established by §§ 63.50 through 63.56. Such a final equivalent emission limitation, and all associated requirements adopted pursuant to § 63.52(f)(2), are directly enforceable under Federal law regardless of whether or not any permit in which they may be contained remains in effect.

              § 63.51
              Definitions.
              Terms used in §§ 63.50 through 63.56 that are not defined in this section have the meaning given to them in the Act, or in subpart A of this part.
              
                Affected source means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard by the section 112(j) deadline, and that is addressed by an applicable MACT emission limitation established pursuant to this subpart.
              
                Available information means, for purposes of conducting a MACT floor finding and identifying control technology options under this subpart, any information that is available as of the date on which the first Part 2 MACT application is filed for a source in the relevant source category or subcategory in the State or jurisdiction; and, pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, is additional relevant information that can be expeditiously provided by the Administrator, is submitted by the applicant or others prior to or during the public comment period on the section 112(j) equivalent emission limitation for that source, or information contained in the information sources in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this definition.

              (1) A relevant proposed regulation, including all supporting information;
              
              (2) Relevant background information documents for a draft or proposed regulation.
              (3) Any relevant regulation, information or guidance collected by the Administrator establishing a MACT floor finding and/or MACT determination.

              (8) Any additional relevant information provided by the applicant.
              
                Control technology means measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques to limit the emission of hazardous air pollutants including, but not limited to, measures which:
              (1) Reduce the quantity, or eliminate emissions, of such pollutants through process changes, substitution of materials or other modifications;
              (2) Enclose systems or processes to eliminate emissions;
              (3) Collect, capture, or treat such pollutants when released from a process, stack, storage or fugitive emissions point;
              (4) Are design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (including requirements for operator training or certification) as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7412(h); or
              (5) Are a combination of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition.
              
                Enhanced review means a review process containing all administrative steps needed to ensure that the terms and conditions resulting from the review process can be incorporated using title V permitting procedures.
              
                Equivalent emission limitation means an emission limitation, established under section 112(j) of the Act, which is equivalent to the MACT standard that EPA would have promulgated under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act.
              
                Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for existing sources means the emission limitation reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies. This limitation shall not be less stringent than the MACT floor.
              
                Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for new sources means the emission limitation which is not less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, and which reflects the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies.
              
                Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) floor means:
              (1) For existing sources:

              (i) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources in the United States (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within 18 months before the emission standard is proposed or within 30 months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the source is not subject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission rate (as defined in section 171 of the Act) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory, for categories and subcategories of stationary sources with 30 or more sources; or
              
              (ii) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing five sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category or subcategory, for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources;
              (2) For new sources, the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.
              
                New affected source means the collection of equipment, activities, or both, that if constructed after the issuance of a section 112(j) permit for the source pursuant to § 63.52, is subject to the applicable MACT emission limitation for new sources. Each permit must define the term “new affected source,” which will be the same as the “affected source” unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:
              (1) Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;
              (2) Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;
              (3) Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;
              (4) Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;
              (5) Incentives for pollution prevention;
              (6) Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);
              (7) Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and
              (8) Other relevant factors.
              
                Permitting authority means the permitting authority as defined in part 70 of this chapter.
              
                Research or laboratory activities means activities whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products where such activities are operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and are not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner; and where the source is not in a source category, specifically addressing research or laboratory activities, that is listed pursuant to section 112(c)(7) of the Act.
              
                Section 112(j) deadline means the date 18 months after the date for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated under this part, except that for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1994, the section 112(j) deadline is November 15, 1996, and for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1997, the section 112(j) deadline is December 15, 1999.
              
                Similar source means that equipment or collection of equipment that, by virtue of its structure, operability, type of emissions and volume and concentration of emissions, is substantially equivalent to the new affected source and employs control technology for control of emissions of hazardous air pollutants that is practical for use on the new affected source.
              
                Source category schedule for standards means the schedule for promulgating MACT standards issued pursuant to section 112(e) of the Act.

              § 63.52
              Approval process for new and existing affected sources.
              (a) Sources subject to section 112(j) as of the section 112(j) deadline. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to major sources that include, as of the section 112(j) deadline, one or more sources in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard under this part on or before an applicable section 112(j) deadline. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued to the source pursuant to the requirements of the subpart, must apply to such sources.

              (1) The owner or operator must submit an application for a title V permit or for a revision to an existing title V permit or a pending title V permit meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) by the section 112(j) deadline if the owner or operator can reasonably determine that one or more sources at the major source belong in the category or subcategory subject to section 112(j).
              
              (2) If an application was not submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and if notified by the permitting authority, the owner or operator must submit an application for a title V permit or for a revision to an existing title V permit or a pending title V permit meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) within 30 days after being notified in writing by the permitting authority that one or more sources at the major source belong to such category or subcategory. Permitting authorities are not required to make such notification.
              (3) The requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section apply when the owner or operator has obtained a title V permit that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under section 112(g) or has submitted a title V permit application for a revision that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g), but has not submitted an application for a title V permit revision that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(j).
              (i) When the owner or operator has a title V permit that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under section 112(g), the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a title V permit revision within 30 days of the section 112(j) deadline or within 30 days of being notified in writing by the permitting authority that one or more sources at the major source belong in such category or subcategory. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j). The title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised title V permit incorporating any additional section 112(j) requirements.

              (ii) When the owner or operator has submitted a title V permit application that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under section 112(g), but has not received the permit incorporating the section 112(g) requirements, the owner or operator must continue to pursue a title V permit that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(g). Within 30 days of issuance of that title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a change to the existing title V permit. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j). The title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised title V permit incorporating any additional section 112(j) requirements.
              (b) Sources that become subject to section 112(j) after the section 112(j) deadline and that do not have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements. The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section apply to sources that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section on the section 112(j) deadline and are, therefore, not subject to section 112(j) on that date, but where events occur subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline that would bring the source under the requirements of this subpart, and the source does not have a title V permit that addresses the requirements of section 112(j).
              (1) When one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to the requirements of this subpart are installed at a major source, or result in the source becoming a major source due to the installation, and the installation does not invoke section 112(g) requirements, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) within 30 days of startup of the source. This application shall be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources.
              (2) The requirements in this paragraph apply when one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to this subpart are installed at a major source, or result in the source becoming a major source due to the installation, and the installation does require emission limitations to be established and permitted under section 112(g), and the owner or operator has not submitted an application for a title V permit revision that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(j). In this case, the owner or operator must apply for and obtain a title V permit that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(g). Within 30 days of issuance of that title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a revision to the existing title V permit. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j). The title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised title V permit incorporating any additional section 112(j) requirements.
              (3) The owner or operator of an area source that, due to a relaxation in any federally enforceable emission limitation (such as a restriction on hours of operation), increases its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart, must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a title V permit or for an application for a title V permit revision within 30 days after the date that such source becomes a major source. This application must be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, must apply to such sources.

              (4) On or after April 5, 2002, if the Administrator establishes a lesser quantity emission rate under section 112(a)(1) of the Act that results in an area source becoming a major source that is subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator of such a major source must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a title V permit or for a change to an existing title V permit or pending title V permit on or before the date 6 months after the date that such source becomes a major source. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources.
              (c) Sources that have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply to major sources that include one or more sources in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator fails to promulgate an emission standard under this part on or before an applicable section 112(j) deadline, and the owner or operator has a permit meeting the section 112(j) requirements, and where changes occur at the major source to equipment, activities, or both, subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline.
              (1) If the title V permit already provides the appropriate requirements that address the events that occur under paragraph (c) of this section subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline, then the source must comply with the applicable new source MACT or existing source MACT requirements as specified in the permit, and the section 112(j) requirements are thus satisfied.
              (2) If the title V permit does not contain the appropriate requirements that address the events that occur under paragraph (c) of this section subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline, then the owner or operator must submit an application for a revision to the existing title V permit that meets the requirements of § 63.53(a). The application must be submitted within 30 days of beginning construction and must be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources.
              (d) Requests for applicability determination or notice of MACT approval. (1) An owner or operator who is unsure of whether one or more sources at a major source belong in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard under this part may, on or before an applicable section 112(j) deadline, request an applicability determination from the permitting authority by submitting an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) by the applicable deadlines specified in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
              (2) In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the owner or operator of a new affected source may submit an application for a Notice of MACT Approval before construction, pursuant to § 63.54.
              (e) Permit application review. (1) Each owner or operator who is required to submit to the permitting authority a Part 1 MACT application which meets the requirements of § 63.53(a) for one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to section 112(j) must also submit to the permitting authority a timely Part 2 MACT application for the same sources which meets the requirements of § 63.53(b). Each owner or operator shall submit the Part 2 MACT application for the sources in a particular category or subcategory no later than the applicable date specified in table 1 to this subpart. The submission date specified in table 1 to this subpart for Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing shall apply to sources in each of the source categories listed in table 2 to this subpart. When the owner or operator is required by §§ 63.50 through 63.56 to submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) by a date which is after the date for a Part 2 MACT application for sources in the category or subcategory in question established by table 1 to this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit a Part 2 MACT application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(b) within 60 additional days after the applicable deadline for submission of the Part 1 MACT application. Part 2 MACT applications must be reviewed by the permitting authority according to procedures established in § 63.55. The resulting MACT determination must be incorporated into the source's title V permit according to procedures established under title V, and any other regulations approved under title V in the jurisdiction in which the affected source is located.
              (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator may request either an applicability determination or an equivalency determination by the permitting authority as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

              (i) Each owner or operator who submitted a request for an applicability determination pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section on or before May 15, 2002, which remains pending before the permitting authority on May 30, 2003, and who still wishes to obtain such a determination, must resubmit that request by July 29, 2003, or by the date which is 60 days after the Administrator publishes in the Federal Register a proposed standard under section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for the category or subcategory in question, whichever is later. Each request for an applicability determination which is resubmitted under this paragraph (e)(2)(i) must be supplemented to discuss the relation between the source(s) in question and the applicability provision in the proposed standard for the category or subcategory in question, and to explain why there may still be uncertainties that require a determination of applicability. The permitting authority must take action upon each properly resubmitted and supplemented request for an applicability determination within an additional 60 days after the applicable deadline for the resubmitted request. If the applicability determination is positive, the owner or operator must submit a Part 2 MACT application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(b) by the date specified for the category or subcategory in question in Table 1 to this subpart. If the applicability determination is negative, then no further action by the owner or operator is necessary.

              (ii) As specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an owner or operator who has submitted an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) may request a determination by the permitting authority of whether emission limitations adopted pursuant to a prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) that apply to one or more sources at a major source in a relevant category or subcategory are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. Such a request must be submitted by the date for the category or subcategory in question specified in Table 1 to this subpart. Any owner or operator who previously submitted such a request under a prior version of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) need not resubmit the request. Each request for an equivalency determination under this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), regardless of when it was submitted, will be construed in the alternative as a complete application for an equivalent emission limitation under section 112(j). The process for determination by the permitting authority of whether the emission limitations in the prior case-by-case MACT determination are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt under section 112(j) must include the opportunity for full public, EPA, and affected State review prior to a final determination. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations in the prior case-by-case MACT determination are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt under section 112(j), then the permitting authority must adopt the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j) for the source in question. If more than 3 years remain on the current title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application for a title V permit revision to make any conforming changes in the permit required to adopt the existing emission limitations as the section 112(j) MACT emission limitations. If less than 3 years remain on the current title V permit, any required conforming changes must be made when the permit is renewed. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations in the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are not substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt for the source in question under section 112(j), the permitting authority must make a new MACT determination and adopt a title V permit incorporating an appropriate equivalent emission limitation under section 112(j). Such a determination constitutes final action for purposes of judicial review under 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x) and corresponding State title V program provisions.
              (3) Within 60 days of submittal of the Part 2 MACT application, the permitting authority must notify the owner or operator in writing whether the application is complete or incomplete. The Part 2 MACT application shall be deemed complete on the date it was submitted unless the permitting authority notifies the owner or operator in writing within 60 days of the submittal that the Part 2 MACT application is incomplete. A Part 2 MACT application is complete if it is sufficient to begin processing the application for a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements. In the event that the permitting authority disapproves a permit application or determines that the application is incomplete, the owner or operator must revise and resubmit the application to meet the objections of the permitting authority. The permitting authority must specify a reasonable period in which the owner or operator is required to remedy the deficiencies in the disapproved or incomplete application. This period may not exceed 6 months from the date the owner or operator is first notified that the application has been disapproved or is incomplete.
              (4) Following submittal of a Part 1 or Part 2 MACT application, the permitting authority may request additional information from the owner or operator. The owner or operator must respond to such requests in a timely manner.
              (5) If the owner or operator has submitted a timely and complete application as required by this section, any failure to have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements shall not be a violation of section 112(j), unless the delay in final action is due to the failure of the applicant to submit, in a timely manner, information required or requested to process the application. Once a complete application is submitted, the owner or operator shall not be in violation of the requirement to have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements.
              (f) Permit content. The title V permit must contain an equivalent emission limitation (or limitations) for the relevant category or subcategory determined on a case-by-case basis by the permitting authority, or, if the applicable criteria in subpart D of this part are met, the title V permit may contain an alternative emission limitation. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, early reductions made pursuant to section 112(i)(5)(A) of the Act must be achieved not later than the date on which the relevant standard should have been promulgated according to the source category schedule for standards.
              (1) The title V permit must contain an emission standard or emission limitation that is equivalent to existing source MACT and an emission standard or emission limitation that is equivalent to new source MACT for control of emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The MACT emission standards or limitations must be determined by the permitting authority and must be based on the degree of emission reductions that can be achieved if the control technologies or work practices are installed, maintained, and operated properly. The permit must also specify the affected source and the new affected source. If construction of a new affected source or reconstruction of an affected source commences after a title V permit meeting the requirements of section 112(j) has been issued for the source, the new source MACT compliance dates must apply.

              (2) The title V permit must specify any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In developing the title V permit, the permitting authority must consider and specify the appropriate provisions of subpart A of this part. The title V permit must also include the information in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) In addition to the MACT emission limitation required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, additional emission limits, production limits, operational limits or other terms and conditions necessary to ensure practicable enforceability of the MACT emission limitation.
              (ii) Compliance certifications, testing, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are consistent with requirements established pursuant to title V and paragraph (h) of this section.
              (iii) Compliance dates by which the owner or operator must be in compliance with the MACT emission limitation and all other applicable terms and conditions of the permit.
              (A) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart must comply with the emission limitation(s) by the date established in the source's title V permit. In no case shall such compliance date be later than 3 years after the issuance of the permit for that source, except where the permitting authority issues a permit that grants an additional year to comply in accordance with section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, or unless otherwise specified in section 112(i), or in subpart D of this part.
              (B) The owner or operator of a new affected source, as defined in the title V permit meeting the requirements of section 112(j), that is subject to the requirements of this subpart must comply with a new source MACT level of control immediately upon startup of the new affected source.
              (g) Permit issuance dates. The permitting authority must issue a title V permit meeting section 112(j) requirements within 18 months after submittal of the complete Part 2 MACT application.
              (h) Enhanced monitoring. In accordance with section 114(a)(3) of the Act, monitoring shall be capable of demonstrating continuous compliance for each compliance period during the applicable reporting period. Such monitoring data shall be of sufficient quality to be used as a basis for directly enforcing all applicable requirements established under this subpart, including emission limitations.
              (i) MACT emission limitations. (1) The owner or operator of affected sources subject to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must comply with all requirements of this subpart that are applicable to affected sources, including the compliance date for affected sources established in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
              (2) The owner or operator of new affected sources subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section must comply with all requirements of this subpart that are applicable to new affected sources, including the compliance date for new affected sources established in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.

              Application content for case-by-case MACT determinations.
              (a) Part 1 MACT application. The Part 1 application for a MACT determination must contain the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) The name and address (physical location) of the major source.
              (2) A brief description of the major source and an identification of the relevant source category.
              (3) An identification of the types of emission points belonging to the relevant source category.
              (4) An identification of any affected sources for which a section 112(g) MACT determination has been made.
              (b) Part 2 MACT application. (1) In compiling a Part 2 MACT application, the owner or operator may cross-reference specific information in any prior submission by the owner or operator to the permitting authority, but in cross-referencing such information the owner or operator may not presume favorable action on any prior application or request which is still pending. In compiling a Part 2 MACT application, the owner or operator may also cross-reference any part of a standard proposed by the Administrator pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for any category or subcategory which includes sources to which the Part 2 application applies.
              (2) The Part 2 application for a MACT determination must contain the information in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section.
              (i) For a new affected source, the anticipated date of startup of operation.
              (ii) Each emission point or group of emission points at the affected source which is part of a category or subcategory for which a Part 2 MACT application is required, and each of the hazardous air pollutants emitted at those emission points. When the Administrator has proposed a standard pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for a category or subcategory, such information may be limited to those emission points and hazardous air pollutants which would be subject to control under the proposed standard.
              (iii) Any existing Federal, State, or local limitations or requirements governing emissions of hazardous air pollutants from those emission points which are part of a category or subcategory for which a Part 2 application is required.
              (iv) For each identified emission point or group of affected emission points, an identification of control technology in place.
              (v) Any additional emission data or other information specifically requested by the permitting authority.
              (3) The Part 2 application for a MACT determination may, but is not required to, contain the following information:
              (i) Recommended emission limitations for the affected source and support information consistent with § 63.52(f). The owner or operator may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, as an emission limitation.
              (ii) A description of the control technologies that would be applied to meet the emission limitation including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency and any other information deemed appropriate by the permitting authority, and identification of the affected sources to which the control technologies must be applied.
              (iii) Relevant parameters to be monitored and frequency of monitoring to demonstrate continuous compliance with the MACT emission limitation over the applicable reporting period.

              § 63.54
              Preconstruction review procedures for new affected sources.
              The requirements of this section apply to an owner or operator who constructs a new affected source subject to § 63.52(c)(1). The purpose of this section is to describe alternative review processes that the permitting authority may use to make a MACT determination for the new affected source.
              (a) Review process for new affected sources. (1) If the permitting authority requires an owner or operator to obtain or revise a title V permit before construction of the new affected source, or when the owner or operator chooses to obtain or revise a title V permit before construction, the owner or operator must follow the procedures established under the applicable title V permit program before construction of the new affected source.
              (2) If an owner or operator is not required to obtain or revise a title V permit before construction of the new affected source (and has not elected to do so), but the new affected source is covered by any preconstruction or preoperation review requirements established pursuant to section 112(g) of the Act, then the owner or operator must comply with those requirements in order to ensure that the requirements of section 112(j) and (g) are satisfied. If the new affected source is not covered by section 112(g), the permitting authority, in its discretion, may issue a Notice of MACT Approval, or the equivalent, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, or an equivalent permit review process, before construction or operation of the new affected source.

              (3) Regardless of the review process, the MACT determination shall be consistent with the principles established in § 63.55. The application for a Notice of MACT Approval or a title V permit, permit modification, or administrative amendment, whichever is applicable, shall include the documentation required by § 63.53.
              
              (b) Optional administrative procedures for preconstruction or preoperation review for new affected sources. The permitting authority may provide for an enhanced review of section 112(j) MACT determinations for review procedures and compliance requirements equivalent to those set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
              (1) The permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing as to whether the application for a MACT determination is complete or whether additional information is required.
              (2) The permitting authority will approve an applicant's proposed control technology, or the permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing of its intention to disapprove a control technology.
              (3) The owner or operator may present in writing, within a time frame specified by the permitting authority, additional information, considerations, or amendments to the application before the permitting authority's issuance of a final disapproval.
              (4) The permitting authority will issue a preliminary approval or issue a disapproval of the application, taking into account additional information received from the owner or operator.
              (5) A determination to disapprove any application will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based.
              (6) Approval of an applicant's proposed control technology must be set forth in a Notice of MACT Approval (or the equivalent) as described in § 63.52(f).
              (c) Opportunity for public comment on Notice of MACT Approval. The permitting authority will provide opportunity for public comment on the preliminary Notice of MACT Approval prior to issuance, including, at a minimum,
              (1) Availability for public inspection in at least one location in the area affected of the information submitted by the owner or operator and of the permitting authority's tentative determination;
              (2) A period for submittal of public comment of at least 30 days; and
              (3) A notice by prominent advertisement in the area affected of the location of the source information and analysis specified in § 63.52(f). The form and content of the notice must be substantially equivalent to that found in § 70.7 of this chapter.
              (4) An opportunity for a public hearing, if one is requested. The permitting authority will give at least 30 days notice in advance of any hearing.
              (d) Review by the EPA and affected States. The permitting authority must send copies of the preliminary notice (in time for comment) and final notice required by paragraph (c) of this section to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office, and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction in affected States. The permitting authority must provide EPA with a review period for the final notice of at least 45 days and shall not issue a final Notice of MACT Approval until EPA objections are satisfied.
              (e) Compliance with MACT determinations. An owner or operator of a major source that is subject to a MACT determination must comply with notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements established under § 63.52(h), under title V, and at the discretion of the permitting authority, under subpart A of this part. The permitting authority must provide the EPA with the opportunity to review compliance requirements for consistency with requirements established pursuant to title V during the review period under paragraph (d) of this section.
              (f) Equivalency under section 112(l). If a permitting authority requires preconstruction review for new source MACT determinations under this subpart, such requirement shall not necessitate a determination under subpart E of this part.

              § 63.55
              Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) determinations for affected sources subject to case-by-case determination of equivalent emission limitations.
              (a) Requirements for permitting authorities. The permitting authority must determine whether the § 63.53(a) Part 1 and § 63.53(b) Part 2 MACT application is complete or an application for a Notice of MACT Approval is approvable. In either case, when the application is complete or approvable, the permitting authority must establish hazardous air pollutant emissions limitations equivalent to the limitations that would apply if an emission standard had been issued in a timely manner under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act. The permitting authority must establish these emissions limitations consistent with the following requirements and principles:
              (1) Emission limitations must be established for the equipment and activities within the affected sources within a source category or subcategory for which the section 112(j) deadline has passed.
              (2) Each emission limitation for an existing affected source must reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by affected sources in the category or subcategory for which the section 112(j) deadline has passed. This limitation must not be less stringent than the MACT floor which must be established by the permitting authority according to the requirements of section 112(d)(3)(A) and (B) and must be based upon available information.
              (3) Each emission limitation for a new affected source must reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable. This limitation must not be less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source which must be established by the permitting authority according to the requirements of section 112(d)(3). This limitation must be based upon available information.
              (4) The permitting authority must select a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, when it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an equivalent emission limitation due to the nature of the process or pollutant. It is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a limitation when the Administrator determines that hazardous air pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to capture such pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local law, or the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological and economic limitations.
              (5) Nothing in this subpart shall prevent a State or local permitting authority from establishing an emission limitation more stringent than required by Federal regulations.
              (b) Reporting to EPA. The owner or operator must submit additional copies of its Part 1 and Part 2 MACT application for a title V permit, permit revision, or Notice of MACT Approval, whichever is applicable, to the EPA at the same time the material is submitted to the permitting authority.
              [67 FR 16610, Apr. 5, 2002]
            
            
              § 63.56
              Requirements for case-by-case determination of equivalent emission limitations after promulgation of subsequent MACT standard.
              (a) If the Administrator promulgates a relevant emission standard that is applicable to one or more affected sources within a major source before the date a permit application under this paragraph (a) is approved, the title V permit must contain the promulgated standard rather than the emission limitation determined under § 63.52, and the owner or operator must comply with the promulgated standard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard.

              (b) If the Administrator promulgates a relevant emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act that is applicable to a source after the date a permit is issued pursuant to § 63.52 or § 63.54, the permitting authority must incorporate requirements of that standard in the title V permit upon its next renewal. The permitting authority must establish a compliance date in the revised permit that assures that the owner or operator must comply with the promulgated standard within a reasonable time, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated or 8 years after the date by which the owner or operator was first required to comply with the emission limitation established by the permit, whichever is earlier. However, in no event shall the period for compliance for existing sources be shorter than that provided for existing sources in the promulgated standard.
              (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall apply.
              (1) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) that is applicable to an affected source after the date a permit application under this paragraph is approved under § 63.52 or § 63.54, the permitting authority is not required to change the emission limitation in the permit to reflect the promulgated standard if the permitting authority determines that the level of control required by the emission limitation in the permit is substantially as effective as that required by the promulgated standard pursuant to § 63.1(e).
              (2) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act that is applicable to an affected source after the date a permit application is approved under § 63.52 or § 63.54, and the level of control required by the promulgated standard is less stringent than the level of control required by any emission limitation in the prior MACT determination, the permitting authority is not required to incorporate any less stringent emission limitation of the promulgated standard in the title V permit and may in its discretion consider any more stringent provisions of the MACT determination to be applicable legal requirements when issuing or revising such a title V permit.

              § 63.70
              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to an owner or operator of an existing source who wishes to obtain a compliance extension from a standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act. The provisions of this subpart also apply to a State or local agency acting pursuant to a permit program approved under title V of the Act. The Administrator will carry out the provisions of this subpart for any State that does not have an approved permit program.
            
            
              § 63.71
              Definitions.
              All terms used in this subpart not defined in this section are given the same meaning as in the Act.
              
                Act means the Clean Air Act as amended.
              
                Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant, but does not include excess emissions from a malfunction, or startups and shutdowns associated with a malfunction. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the source's actual operating rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.
              
                Artificially or substantially greater emissions means abnormally high emissions such as could be caused by equipment malfunctions, accidents, unusually high production or operating rates compared to historical rates, or other unusual circumstances.
              
                EPA conditional method means any method of sampling and analyzing for air pollutants that has been validated by the Administrator but that has not been published as an EPA Reference Method.
              
                EPA reference method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant as described in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter, appendix B of part 61 of this chapter, or appendix A of part 63.
              
                Equipment leaks means leaks from pumps, compressors, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, agitators, accumulator vessels, and instrumentation systems in hazardous air pollutant service.
              
                Existing source means any source as defined in § 63.72, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced prior to proposal of an applicable section 112(d) standard.
              
                Hazardous air pollutant (HAP) means any air pollutant listed pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.
              
                High-risk pollutant means a hazardous air pollutant listed in Table 1 of § 63.74.
              
                Malfunction means any sudden failure of air pollution control equipment or process equipment or of a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused entirely or in part by poor maintenance, careless operation, or any other preventable upset condition or preventable equipment breakdown shall not be considered malfunctions.
              
                Not feasible to prescribe or enforce a numerical emission limitation means a situation in which the Administrator or a State determines that a pollutant (or stream of pollutants) listed pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture such pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with any Federal law; or the application of measurement technology to a particular source is not practicable due to technological or economic limitations.
              
                Permitting authority means either a State agency with an approved permitting program under Title V of the Act or the Administrator in cases where the State does not have an approved permitting program.
              
                Post-reduction year means the one year period beginning with the date early reductions have to be achieved to qualify for a compliance extension under subpart D of this part, unless a source has established with the permitting authority an earlier one year period as the post-reduction year. For most sources, the post-reduction year would begin with the date of proposal of the first section 112(d) standard applicable to the early reductions source; however, for sources that have made enforceable commitments, it would be the year from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994.
              
                Responsible official means one of the following:
              (1) For a corporation, a president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy- or decision-making functions for the corporation; or a duly authorized representative of such person if the representative is responsible for the overall operation of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities applying for or subject to a permit and either:
              (i) The facilities employ more than 250 persons or have gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second quarter 1980 dollars); or
              (ii) The delegation of authority to such representative is approved in advance by the permitting authority.
              (2) For a partnership or sole proprietorship, a general partner or the proprietor, respectively.
              (3) For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency, either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. For the purposes of this part, a principal executive officer of a Federal agency includes the chief executive officer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., Regional Administrators of EPA).
              
                Reviewing agency means a State agency with an approved permitting program under Title V of the Act. An EPA Regional Office is the reviewing agency where the State does not have such an approved permitting program.
              
                State means a State or local air pollution control agency.

              § 63.72
              General provisions for compliance extensions.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a permitting authority acting pursuant to a permitting program approved under Title V of the Act shall by permit allow an existing source to meet an alternative emission limitation in lieu of an emission limitation promulgated under section 112(d) of the Act for a period of 6 years from the compliance date of the otherwise applicable standard provided the source owner or operator demonstrates:
              (1) According to the requirements of § 63.74 that the source has achieved a reduction of 90 percent (95 percent or more in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) in emissions of:
              (i) Total hazardous air pollutants from the source;
              (ii) Total hazardous air pollutants from the source as adjusted for high-risk pollutant weighting factors, if applicable.
              (2) That such reduction was achieved before proposal of an applicable standard or, for sources eligible to qualify for an alternative emission limitation as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, before January 1, 1994.
              (b) A source granted an alternative emission limitation shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act immediately upon expiration of the six year compliance extension period specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) An existing source that achieves the reduction specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section after proposal of an applicable section 112(d) standard but before January 1, 1994, may qualify for an alternative emission limitation under paragraph (a) of this section if the source makes an enforceable commitment, prior to proposal of the applicable standard, to achieve such reduction. The enforceable commitment shall be made according to the procedures and requirements of § 63.75.
              (d) For each permit issued to a source under paragraph (a) of this section, there shall be established as part of the permit an enforceable alternative emission limitation for hazardous air pollutants reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for the alternative emission limitation.
              (e) An alternative emission limitation shall not be available with respect to standards or requirements promulgated to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, and the Administrator will, for the purpose of determining whether a standard under section 112(f) of the Act is necessary, review emissions from sources granted an alternative emission limitation under this subpart at the same time that other sources in the category or subcategory are reviewed.
              (f) Nothing in this subpart shall preclude a State from requiring hazardous air pollutant reductions in excess of 90 percent (95 percent in the case of particulate hazardous air pollutants) as a condition of such State granting an alternative emission limitation authorized in paragraph (a) of this section.
            
            
              § 63.73
              Source.
              (a) An alternative emission limitation may be granted under this subpart to an existing source. For the purposes of this subpart only, a source is defined as follows:
              (1) A building structure, facility, or installation identified as a source by the EPA in appendix B of this part;
              (2) All portions of an entire contiguous plant site under common ownership or control that emit hazardous air pollutants;
              (3) Any portion of an entire contiguous plant site under common ownership or control that emits hazardous air pollutants and can be identified as a facility, building, structure, or installation for the purposes of establishing standards under section 112(d) of the Act; or
              (4) Any individual emission point or combination of emission points within a contiguous plant site under common control, provided that emission reduction from such point or aggregation of points constitutes a significant reduction of hazardous air pollutant emissions of the entire contiguous plant site.

              (b) For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, emissions reductions are considered significant if they are made from base year emissions of not less than:
              (1) A total of 10 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants where the total emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the base year from the entire contiguous plant site is greater than 25 tons per; or
              (2) A total of 5 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants where the total emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the base year from the entire contiguous plant site is less than or equal to 25 tons per year.
            
            
              § 63.74
              Demonstration of early reduction.
              (a) An owner or operator applying for an alternative emission limitation shall demonstrate achieving early reductions as required by § 63.72(a)(1) by following the procedures in this section.
              (b) An owner or operator shall establish the source for the purposes of this subpart by documenting the following information:
              (1) A description of the source including: a site plan of the entire contiguous plant site under common control which contains the source, markings on the site plan locating the parts of the site that constitute the source, and the activity at the source which causes hazardous air pollutant emissions;
              (2) A complete list of all emission points of hazardous air pollutants in the source, including identification numbers and short descriptive titles; and
              (3) A statement showing that the source conforms to one of the allowable definition options from § 63.73. For a source conforming to the option in § 63.73(a)(4), the total base year emissions from the source, as determined pursuant to this section, shall be demonstrated to be at least:
              (i) 5 tons per year, for cases in which total hazardous air pollutant emissions from the entire contiguous plant site under common control are 25 tons per year or less as calculated under paragraph (1) of this section; or
              (ii) 10 tons per year in all other cases.
              (c) An owner or operator shall establish base year emissions for the source by providing the following information:
              (1) The base year chosen, where the base year shall be 1987 or later except that the base year may be 1985 or 1986 if the owner or operator of the source can demonstrate that emission data for the source for 1985 or 1986 was submitted to the Administrator pursuant to an information request issued under section 114 of the Act and was received by the Administrator prior to November 15, 1990;
              (2) The best available data accounting for actual emissions, during the base year, of all hazardous air pollutants from each emission point listed in the source in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
              (3) The supporting basis for each emission number provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section including:
              (i) For test results submitted as the supporting basis, a description of the test protocol followed, any problems encountered during the testing, and a discussion of the validity of the method for measuring the subject emissions; and
              (ii) For calculations based on emission factors, material balance, or engineering principles and submitted as the supporting basis, a step-by-step description of the calculations, including assumptions used and their bases, and a brief rationale for the validity of the calculation method used; and
              (4) Evidence that the emissions provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not artificially or substantially greater than emissions in other years prior to implementation of emission reduction measures.
              (d) An owner or operator shall establish post-reduction emissions by providing the following information:
              (1) For the emission points listed in the source in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a description of all control measures employed to achieve the emission reduction required by § 63.72(a)(1);

              (2) The best available data accounting for actual emissions, during the year following the applicable emission reduction deadline as specified in § 63.72(a)(2), of all hazardous air pollutants from each emission point in the source listed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              
              (3) The supporting basis for each emission number provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section including:
              (i) For test results submitted as the supporting basis, a description of the test protocol followed, any problems encountered during the testing, and a discussion of the validity of the method for measuring the subject emissions; and
              (ii) For calculations based on emission factors, material balance, or engineering principles and submitted as the supporting basis, a step-by-step description of the calculations, including assumptions used and their bases, and a brief rationale for the validity of the calculation method used;
              (4) [Reserved]
              (5) Evidence that there was no increase in radionuclide emissions from the source.
              (e)(1) An owner or operator shall demonstrate that both total base year emissions and total base year emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, as applicable, have been reduced by at least 90 percent for gaseous hazardous air pollutants emitted and 95 percent for particulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by determining the following for gaseous and particulate emissions separately:
              (i) Total base year emissions, calculated by summing all base year emission data from paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
              (ii) Total post-reduction emissions, calculated by summing all post-reduction emission data from paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
              (iii) (If applicable) Total base year emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, calculated by multiplying each emission number for a pollutant from paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the appropriate weighting factor for the pollutant from Table 1 in paragraph (f) of this section and then summing all weighted emission data;
              (iv) (If applicable) Total post-reduction emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, calculated by multiplying each emission number for a pollutant from paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the appropriate weighting factor for the pollutant from Table 1 and then summing all weighted emission data; and
              (v) Percent reductions, calculated by dividing the difference between base year and post-reduction emissions by the base year emissions. Separate demonstrations are required for total gaseous and particulate emissions, and total gaseous and particulate emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants.
              (2) If any points in the source emit both particulate and gaseous pollutants, as an alternative to the demonstration required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate:
              (i) A weighted average percent reduction for all points emitting both particulate and gaseous pollutants where the weighted average percent reduction is determined by
              
                EC21OC91.019
              
              
                where %W = the required weighted percent reduction
                Σ Mg = the total mass rate (e.g., kg/yr) of all gaseous emissions
                Σ Mp = the total mass rate of all particulate emissions and,
              
              
              (ii) The reductions required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for all other points in the source.
              (f) If lower rates or hours are used to achieve all or part of the emission reduction, any hazardous air pollutant emissions that occur from a compensating increase in rates or hours from the same activity elsewhere within the plant site which contains the source shall be counted in the post-reduction emissions from the source. If emission reductions are achieved by shutting down process equipment and the shutdown equipment is restarted or replaced anywhere within the plant site, any hazardous air pollutant emissions from the restarted or replacement equipment shall be counted in the post-reduction emissions for the source.

              (g) The best available data representing actual emissions for the purpose of establishing base year or post-reduction emissions under this section shall consist of documented results from source tests using an EPA Reference Method, EPA Conditional Method, or the owner's or operator's source test method which has been validated pursuant to Method 301 of appendix A of this part. However, if one of the following conditions exists, an owner or operator may submit, in lieu of results from source tests, calculations based on engineering principles, emission factors, or material balance data as actual emission data for establishing base year or post-reduction emissions:
              (1) No applicable EPA Reference Method, EPA Conditional Method, or other source test method exists;
              (2) It is not technologically or economically feasible to perform source tests;
              (3) It can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the reviewing agency that the calculations will provide emission estimates of accuracy comparable to that of any applicable source test method;
              (4) For base year emission estimates only, the base year conditions no longer exist at an emission point in the source and emission data could not be produced for such an emission point, by performing source tests under currently existing conditions and converting the test results to reflect base year conditions, that is more accurate than an estimate produced by using engineering principles, emission factors, or a material balance; or
              (5) The emissions from one or a set of emission points in the source are small compared to total source emissions and potential errors in establishing emissions from such points will not have a significant effect on the accuracy of total emissions established for the source.
              (h) For base year or post-reduction emissions established under this section that are not supported by source test data, the source owner or operator shall include the reason source testing was not performed.
              (i) [Reserved]
              (j) The EPA average emission factors for equipment leaks cannot be used under this subpart to establish base year emissions for equipment leak sources, unless the base year emission number calculated using the EPA average emission factors for equipment leaks also is used as the post-reduction emission number for equipment leaks from the source.
              (k) A source owner or operator shall not establish base year or post-reduction emissions that include any emissions from the source exceeding allowable emission levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit condition.

              (l) For sources subject to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator shall document total base year emissions from an entire contiguous plant site under common control by providing the information required pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2), and (e)(1)(i) of this section for all hazardous air pollutants from all emission points in the contiguous plant site under common control.
              (m) If a new pollutant is added to the list of hazardous air pollutants or high-risk pollutants, any source emitting such pollutant will not be required to revise an early reduction demonstration pursuant to this section if:
              (1) Alternative emission limits have previously been specified by permit for the source as provided for in § 63.72(a); or
              (2) The base year emissions submitted in an enforceable commitment have previously been approved by the reviewing agency.

              § 63.75
              Enforceable commitments.
              (a) To make an enforceable commitment an owner or operator shall submit a commitment to achieve the early reductions required under § 63.72(a)(1) to the appropriate EPA Regional Office and a copy of the commitment to the appropriate State, except that the commitment shall be submitted to the State and a copy to the EPA Regional Office if the State has an approved permitting program under Title V of the Act. A copy shall also be submitted to both the EPA Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341W), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 and the EPA Emission Standards Division (MD-13), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; attention both to the Early Reductions Officer. The commitment shall contain:
              (1) The name and address of the source;
              (2) The name and telephone number of the source owner or operator or other responsible official who can be contacted concerning the commitment;
              (3) An alternative mailing address if correspondence is to be directed to a location other than that given in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
              (4) All information specified in § 63.74(b), (c) and (e)(1)(i), which defines and describes the source and establishes the base year hazardous air pollutant emissions from the source;
              (5) The general plan for achieving the required hazardous air pollutant emissions reductions at the source including descriptions of emission control equipment to be employed, process changes or modifications to be made, and any other emission reduction measures to be used; and
              (6) A statement of commitment, signed by a responsible official of the source, containing the following:
              (i) A statement providing the post-reduction emission levels for total hazardous air pollutants and high-risk pollutants, as applicable, from the source on an annual basis which reflect a 90 percent (95 percent for particulate pollutants) reduction from base year emissions;
              (ii) A statement certifying that the base year emission data submitted as part of the enforceable commitment constitute the best available data for base year emissions from the source, are correct to the best of the responsible official's knowledge, and are within allowable levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit;
              (iii) A statement that it is understood by the source owner or operator that submission of base year emissions constitutes a response to an EPA request under the authority of section 114 of the Act and that the commitment is subject to enforcement according to § 63.80; and
              (iv) A statement committing the source owner or operator to achieving the emission levels, listed in paragraph (a)(6), (i) of this section, at the source before January 1, 1994.

              (b) The following language may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) through (a)(6)(iv) of this section:
              
              

                I certify to the best of my knowledge that the base year emissions given above are correct and constitute the best available data for base year emissions from the source, and acknowledge that these estimates are being submitted in response to an EPA request under section 114 of the Act. I further certify that the base year emissions provided for all emission points in the source do not exceed allowable emission levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit condition. I commit to achieve before January 1, 1994, the stated post-reduction emission level(s) at the source, which will provide the 90 (95) percent reduction required to qualify for the compliance extension, and acknowledge that this commitment is enforceable as specified in title 40, part 63, subpart D, of the Code of Federal Regulations.
              
              
              (c) A commitment for a source shall be submitted prior to proposal of an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act. Commitments received after the proposal date shall be void.
              (d) If test results for one or more emission points in a source are required to support base year emissions in an enforceable commitment but are not available prior to proposal of an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act, the test results may be submitted after the enforceable commitment is made but no later than 180 days after proposal of an applicable standard. In such cases, the enforceable commitment shall contain the best substitute emission data for the points in the source for which test results will be submitted later.
              (e) An owner or operator may rescind such a commitment prior to December 1, 1993 without penalty and forfeit the opportunity to obtain a six year compliance extension under this subpart.
              (f) An enforceable commitment submitted under this section shall not be in effect and enforceable until the base year emissions contained in the commitment have been approved according to the procedures in § 63.76. An owner or operator is under no obligation to continue to seek approval of commitments that have not been approved by December 1, 1993.
              (g) The control measure information required under § 63.74(d)(1) as part of post-reduction emission documentation and submitted in a permit application according to the provisions of § 63.77 shall become part of an existing enforceable commitment upon receipt of the permit application by the permitting authority. An owner or operator shall notify the permitting authority of any change made to the source during calendar year 1994 which affects such control measure information and shall mail the notice within 5 days (postmark date) of making the change. The notice shall be considered an amendment to the source's enforceable commitment.
              [57 FR 61992, Dec. 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 34370, June 25, 1993; 58 FR 62543, Nov. 29, 1993; 59 FR 59924, Nov. 21, 1994]
            
            
              § 63.76
              Review of base year emissions.
              (a) Pursuant to the procedures of this section, the appropriate reviewing agency shall review and approve or disapprove base year emission data submitted in an enforceable commitment under § 63.75 or in a request letter from an applicant that wishes to participate in the early reduction program but who is not required to submit an enforceable commitment. For review requests submitted to a State agency as the appropriate reviewing agency, a copy of the request also shall be submitted to the applicable EPA Regional Office. For review requests submitted to the EPA Regional Office as the appropriate reviewing agency, a copy of the request also shall be sent to the applicable State agency. Copies also shall be submitted to the EPA Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341W), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 and the EPA Emission Standards Division (MD-13), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; to the attention of the Early Reductions Officer.
              (b) Within 30 days of receipt of an enforceable commitment or base year emission data, the reviewing agency shall advise the applicant that:
              (1) The base year emission data are complete as submitted; or
              (2) The base year emission data are not complete and include a list of deficiencies that must be corrected before review can proceed.
              (c) EPA will publish a notice in the Federal Register which contains a list, accumulated for the previous month, of the sources for which complete base year emission data have been submitted and which are undergoing review either in the EPA Regional Office or a State agency within the EPA region. The notice will contain the name and location of each source and a contract in the EPA Regional Office for additional information.

              (d) Within 60 days of a determination that a base year emission data submission is complete, the reviewing agency shall evaluate the adequacy of the submission with respect to the requirements of § 63.74 (b) and (c) and either:
              (1) Determine to approve the submission and publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located or in a State publication designed to give general public notice, providing the aggregate base year emission data for the source and the rationale for the proposed approval, noting the availability of the nonconfidential information contained in the submission for public inspection in at least one location in the community in which the source is located, providing for a public hearing upon request by an interested party, and establishing a 30 day public comment period that can be extended to 60 days upon request by an interested party; or
              (2) Determine to disapprove the base year emission data and give notice to the applicant of the reasons for the disapproval. An applicant may correct disapproved base year data and submit revised data for review in accordance with this subsection, except that the review of a revision shall be accomplished within 30 days.
              (e) If no adverse public comments are received by the reviewing agency on proposed base year data for a source, the data shall be considered approved at the close of the public comment period and a notice of the approval shall be sent to the applicant and published by the reviewing agency by advertisement in the area affected.
              (f) If adverse comments are received and the reviewing agency agrees that corrections are needed, the reviewing agency shall give notice to the applicant of the disapproval and reasons for the disapproval. An applicant may correct disapproved base year emission data and submit revised emission data. If a revision is submitted by the applicant that, to the satisfaction of the reviewing agency, takes into account the adverse comments, the reviewing agency will publish by advertisement in the area affected a notice containing the approved base year emission data for the source and send notice of the approval to the applicant.
              (g) If adverse comments are received and the reviewing agency determines that the comments do not warrant changes to the base year emission data, the reviewing agency will publish by advertisement in the area affected a notice containing the approved base year emission data for the source and the reasons for not accepting the adverse comments. A notice of the approval also shall be sent to the applicant.
              (h) If an applicant submits revised emission data under paragraph (d)(2) or (f) of this section for a source subject to an enforceable commitment, the applicant also shall submit an amended enforceable commitment which takes into account the revised base year emissions.
              (i) If revised base year emission data are not submitted or notice of intent to submit revised data is not provided to the permitting authority by an applicant within 90 days of receiving adverse comments or a notice of disapproved base year emission data for a source that is subject to an enforceable commitment, the enforceable commitment shall be considered withdrawn and a notice to that effect shall be sent by the reviewing agency to the applicant.
            
            
              § 63.77
              Application procedures.
              (a) To apply for an alternative emission limitation under § 63.72, an owner or operator of the source shall file a permit application with the appropriate permitting authority.
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the permit application shall contain the information required by § 63.74, as applicable, and the additional information required for a complete permit application as specified by the applicable permit program established pursuant to title V of the Act.
              (c) Permit applications under this section for sources not subject to enforceable commitments shall be submitted by the later of the following dates:
              (1) 120 days after proposal of an otherwise applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act; or

              (2) 120 days after the date an applicable permit program is approved or established pursuant to title V of the Act.
              
              (d) Permit applications for sources subject to enforceable commitments pursuant to § 63.75 shall be submitted no later than April 30, 1994.
              (e) If the post-reduction year does not end at least one month before the permit application deadline under paragraph (c) of this section, the source may file the post-reduction emissions information required under § 63.74(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(5) later as a supplement to the original permit application. In such cases, this supplemental information shall be submitted to the permitting authority no later than one month after the end of the post-reduction year.
              (f) If a source test will be the supporting basis for establishing post-reduction emissions for one or more emissions units in the early reductions source, the test results shall be submitted by the applicable deadline for submittal of a permit application as specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
              (g) Review and disposition of permit applications submitted under this section will be accomplished according to the provisions of the applicable permit program established pursuant to title V of the Act.

              § 63.78
              Early reduction demonstration evaluation.
              (a) The permitting authority will evaluate an early reduction demonstration submitted by the source owner or operator in a permit application with respect to the requirements of § 63.74.
              (b) An application for a compliance extension may be denied if, in the judgement of the permitting authority, the owner or operator has failed to demonstrate that the requirements of § 63.74 have been met. Specific reasons for denial include, but are not limited to:
              (1) The information supplied by the owner or operator is incomplete;
              (2) The required 90 percent reduction (95 percent in cases where the hazardous air pollutant is particulate matter) has not been demonstrated;
              (3) The base year or post-reduction emissions are incorrect, based on methods or assumptions that are not valid, or not sufficiently reliable or well documented to determine with reasonable certainty that required reductions have been achieved; or
              (4) The emission of hazardous air pollutants or the performance of emission control measures is unreliable so as to preclude determination that the required reductions have been achieved or will continue to be achieved during the extension period.
            
            
              § 63.79
              Approval of applications.
              (a) If an early reduction demonstration is approved and other requirements for a complete permit application are met, the permitting authority shall establish by a permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act enforceable alternative emissions limitations for the source reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for the extension. However, if it is not feasible to prescribe a numerical emissions limitation for one or more emission points in the source, the permitting authority shall establish such other requirements, reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for an extension, in order to assure the source achieves the 90 percent or 95 percent reduction, as applicable.
              (b) An alternative emissions limitation or other requirement prescribed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be effective and enforceable immediately upon issuance of the permit for the source and shall expire exactly six years after the compliance date of an otherwise applicable standard issued pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act.
            
            
              § 63.80
              Enforcement.
              (a) All base year or post-reduction emissions information described in § 63.74 and required to be submitted as part of a permit application under § 63.77 or an enforceable commitment under § 63.75 shall be considered to have been requested by the Administrator under the authority of section 114 of the Act.

              (b) Fraudulent statements contained in any base year or post-reduction emissions submitted to a State or EPA Regional Office under this subpart shall be considered violations of section 114 of the Act and of this subpart and, thus, actionable under section 113 of the Act and can be considered, in appropriate cases, violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001, the general false swearing provision of the United States Code.
              (c) If a source subject to an enforceable commitment fails to achieve reductions before January 1, 1994, sufficient to qualify the source for an extension under this subpart, the source shall be considered to be in violation of the commitment and shall be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.
              (d) If an early reduction demonstration in a permit application filed under § 63.77 is disapproved for a source not subject to an enforceable commitment, the owner or operator shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act by the compliance date specified in such standard.
              (e) If an early reduction demonstration in a permit application filed under § 63.77 is disapproved for a source that is subject to an enforceable commitment, the owner or operator shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act by the compliance date specified in such standard and will be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.
              (f) A violation of an alternative emission limitation or other requirement established by permit under § 63.79 (a) or (b) for the source is enforceable pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95 percent for hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire source.
            
            
              § 63.81
              Rules for special situations.
              (a) If more than one standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act would be applicable to a source as defined under § 63.73, then the date of proposal referred to in §§ 63.72(a)(2), 63.72(c), 63.74(d)(4), 63.75(c), and 63.77(c) is the date the first applicable standard is proposed.
              (b) Sources emitting radionuclides are not required to reduce radionuclides by 90 (95) percent. Radionuclides may not be increased from the source as a result of the early reductions demonstration.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Approval of State Programs and Delegation of Federal Authorities
            
              § 63.90
              Program overview.
              The regulations in this subpart establish procedures consistent with section 112(l) of the Clean Air Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). This subpart establishes procedures for the approval of State rules, programs, or other requirements such as permit terms and conditions to be implemented and enforced in place of certain otherwise applicable section 112 Federal rules, emission standards, or requirements (including section 112 rules promulgated under the authority of the Act prior to the 1990 Amendments to the Act). The authority to implement and enforce section 112 Federal rules as promulgated without changes may be delegated under procedures established in this subpart. In this process, States may seek approval of a State mechanism for receiving delegation of existing and future unchanged Federal section 112 standards. This subpart clarifies which part 63, subpart A General Provisions authorities can be delegated to States. This subpart also establishes procedures for the review and withdrawal of section 112 implementation and enforcement authorities delegated through this subpart. This subpart also establishes procedures for the approval of State rules or programs to establish limitations on the potential to emit pollutants listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.
              (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this subpart.
              
                Alternative requirements means the requirements, rules, permits, provisions, methods, or other enforceable mechanisms that a State submits for approval under this subpart or subpart A and, after approval, replaces the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 requirements, provisions, or methods.
              
                Applicability criteria means the regulatory criteria used to define all affected sources subject to a specific section 112 rule.
              
                Approval means a determination by the Administrator that a State rule, program, or requirement meets the criteria of § 63.91 and the additional criteria of either § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, or § 63.97 as appropriate. For accidental release prevention programs, the criteria of § 63.95 must be met in addition to the criteria of § 63.91. This is considered a “full approval” for the purposes of this subpart. Partial approvals may also be granted as described in this subpart. Any approved requirements become applicable requirements under § 70.2 of this chapter.
              
                Compliance and enforcement measures means requirements relating to compliance and enforcement, including but not necessarily limited to monitoring methods and procedures, recordkeeping, reporting, plans, inspection, maintenance, and operation requirements, pollution prevention requirements, noticing, field inspections, entry, sampling, or accidental release prevention oversight.
              
                Intermediate change to monitoring means a modification to federally required monitoring involving “proven technology” (generally accepted by the scientific community as equivalent or better) that is applied on a site-specific basis and that may have the potential to decrease the stringency of the associated emission limitation or standard. Though site-specific, an intermediate change may set a national precedent for a source category and may ultimately result in a revision to the federally required monitoring. Examples of intermediate changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Use of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) in lieu of a parameter monitoring approach;
              (2) Decreased frequency for non-continuous parameter monitoring or physical inspections;
              (3) Changes to quality control requirements for parameter monitoring; and
              (4) Use of an electronic data reduction system in lieu of manual data reduction.
              
                Intermediate change to test method means a within-method modification to a federally enforceable test method involving “proven technology” (generally accepted by the scientific community as equivalent or better) that is applied on a site-specific basis and that may have the potential to decrease the stringency of the associated emission limitation or standard. Though site-specific, an intermediate change may set a national precedent for a source category and may ultimately result in a revision to the federally enforceable test method. In order to be approved, an intermediate change must be validated according to EPA Method 301 (Part 63, Appendix A) to demonstrate that it provides equal or improved accuracy and precision. Examples of intermediate changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Modifications to a test method's sampling procedure including substitution of sampling equipment that has been demonstrated for a particular sample matrix, and use of a different impinger absorbing solution;
              (2) Changes in sample recovery procedures and analytical techniques, such as changes to sample holding times and use of a different analytical finish with proven capability for the analyte of interest; and
              (3) “Combining” a federally required method with another proven method for application to processes emitting multiple pollutants.
              
                Level of control means the degree to which a rule, program, or requirement limits emissions or employs design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards, accident prevention, or other requirements or techniques (including a prohibition of emissions) for:
              (1)(i) Each hazardous air pollutant, if individual pollutants are subject to emission limitations, and
              (ii) The aggregate total of hazardous air pollutants, if the aggregate grouping is subject to emission limitations, provided that the rule, program, or requirement would not lead to an increase in risk to human health or the environment; and
              (2) Each substance regulated under part 68 of this chapter.
              (3) Test methods and associated procedures and averaging times are integral to the level of control.
              
                Local agency means a local air pollution control agency or, for the purposes of § 63.95, any local agency or entity having responsibility for preventing accidental releases which may occur at a source regulated under part 68 of this chapter.
              
                Major change to monitoring means a modification to federally required monitoring that uses “unproven technology or procedures” (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new method (sometimes necessary when the required monitoring is unsuitable). A major change to monitoring may be site-specific or may apply to one or more source categories and will almost always set a national precedent. Examples of major changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Use of a new monitoring approach developed to apply to a control technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation;
              (2) Use of a predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) in place of a required continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS);
              (3) Use of alternative calibration procedures that do not involve calibration gases or test cells;
              (4) Use of an analytical technology that differs from that specified by a performance specification;
              (5) Decreased monitoring frequency for a continuous emission monitoring system, continuous opacity monitoring system, predictive emission monitoring system, or continuous parameter monitoring system;
              (6) Decreased monitoring frequency for a leak detection and repair program; and
              (7) Use of alternative averaging times for reporting purposes.
              
                Major change to recordkeeping/reporting means:
              (1) A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting that:
              (i) May decrease the stringency of the required compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standards;
              (ii) May have national significance (e.g., might affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, might set a national precedent); or
              (iii) Is not site-specific.
              (2) Examples of major changes to recordkeeping and reporting include, but are not limited to:
              (i) Decreases in the record retention for all records;
              (ii) Waiver of all or most recordkeeping or reporting requirements;
              (iii) Major changes to the contents of reports; or
              (iv) Decreases in the reliability of recordkeeping or reporting (e.g., manual recording of monitoring data instead of required automated or electronic recording, or paper reports where electronic reporting may have been required).
              
                Major change to test method means a modification to a federally enforceable test method that uses “unproven technology or procedures” (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new method (sometimes necessary when the required test method is unsuitable). A major change to a test method may be site-specific, or may apply to one or more sources or source categories, and will almost always set a national precedent. In order to be approved, a major change must be validated according to EPA Method 301 (part 63, appendix A). Examples of major changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Use of an unproven analytical finish;
              (2) Use of a method developed to fill a test method gap;
              (3) Use of a new test method developed to apply to a control technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation; and
              (4) Combining two or more sampling/analytical methods (at least one unproven) into one for application to processes emitting multiple pollutants.
              
                Minor change to monitoring means:
              (1) A modification to federally required monitoring that:
              (i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standard;
              (ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the monitoring requirements); and

              (iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.
              
              (2) Examples of minor changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:
              (i) Modifications to a sampling procedure, such as use of an improved sample conditioning system to reduce maintenance requirements;
              (ii) Increased monitoring frequency; and
              (iii) Modification of the environmental shelter to moderate temperature fluctuation and thus protect the analytical instrumentation.
              
                Minor change to recordkeeping/reporting means:
              
              (1) A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting that:
              (i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standards;
              (ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the recordkeeping or reporting requirement); and
              (iii) Is site-specific.
              (2) Examples of minor changes to recordkeeping or reporting include, but are not limited to:
              (i) Changes to recordkeeping necessitated by alternatives to monitoring;
              (ii) Increased frequency of recordkeeping or reporting, or increased record retention periods;
              (iii) Increased reliability in the form of recording monitoring data, e.g., electronic or automatic recording as opposed to manual recording of monitoring data;
              (iv) Changes related to compliance extensions granted pursuant to § 63.6(i);
              (v) Changes to recordkeeping for good cause shown for a fixed short duration, e.g., facility shutdown;
              (vi) Changes to recordkeeping or reporting that is clearly redundant with equivalent recordkeeping/reporting requirements; and
              (vii) Decreases in the frequency of reporting for area sources to no less than once a year for good cause shown, or for major sources to no less than twice a year as required by title V, for good cause shown.
              
                Minor change to test method means:
              (1) A modification to a federally enforceable test method that:
              (i) Does not decrease the stringency of the emission limitation or standard;
              (ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the test method); and
              (iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.
              (2) Examples of minor changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:
              (i) Field adjustments in a test method's sampling procedure, such as a modified sampling traverse or location to avoid interference from an obstruction in the stack, increasing the sampling time or volume, use of additional impingers for a high moisture situation, accepting particulate emission results for a test run that was conducted with a lower than specified temperature, substitution of a material in the sampling train that has been demonstrated to be more inert for the sample matrix; and
              (ii) Changes in recovery and analytical techniques such as a change in quality control/quality assurance requirements needed to adjust for analysis of a certain sample matrix.
              
                Partial approval means that the Administrator approves under this subpart:
              (1) A State's legal authorities that fully meet the criteria of § 63.91(d)(3)(ii)-(v), and substantially meet the criteria of § 63.91(d)(3)(i) as appropriate; or
              (2) A State rule or program that meets the criteria of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 with the exception of a separable portion of that State rule or program which fails to meet those criteria. A separable portion of a State rule or program is defined as a section(s) of a rule or a portion(s) of a program which can be acted upon independently without affecting the overall integrity of the rule or program as a whole.
              
                Program means, for the purposes of an approval under this subpart, a collection of State authorities, resources, and other requirements that satisfy the criteria of this subpart and subpart A.
              
                State agency, for the purposes of this subpart, includes State and local air pollution agencies, Indian tribes as defined in § 71.2 of this chapter, and territories of the United States to the extent they are or will be delegated Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements.
              
                Stringent or stringency means the degree of rigor, strictness or severity a statute, rule, emission standard, or requirement imposes on an affected source as measured by the quantity of emissions, or as measured by parameters relating to rule applicability and level of control, or as otherwise determined by the Administrator.
              
                Title V operating permit programs means the part 70 permitting program and the delegated Indian tribal programs under part 70 of this chapter.
              (b) Local agency coordination with State and territorial agencies. Local agencies submitting a rule or program for approval under this subpart shall consult with the relevant State or Territorial agency prior to making a request for approval to the Administrator. A State or Territorial agency may submit requests for approval on behalf of a local agency after consulting with that local agency.
              (c) Tribal authority. A tribal authority may submit a rule or program under this subpart, provided that the tribal authority has received approval, under the provisions of part 49 of this chapter, for administering Federal rules under section 112 of the Act.
              (d) Authorities retained by the Administrator. (1) The following authorities will be retained by the Administrator and will not be delegated:
              (i) The authority to add or delete pollutants from the list of hazardous air pollutants established under section 112(b);
              (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
              (iv) The authority to add source categories to or delete source categories from the Federal source category list established under section 112(c)(1) or to subcategorize categories on the Federal source category list after proposal of a relevant emission standard;
              (v) The authority to revise the source category schedule established under section 112(e) by moving a source category to a later date for promulgation; and
              (vi) Any other authorities determined to be nondelegable by the Administrator.
              (2) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit the Administrator from enforcing any applicable rule, emission standard or requirement established under section 112.
              (3) Nothing in this subpart shall affect the authorities and obligations of the Administrator or the State under title V of the Act or under regulations promulgated pursuant to that title.
              (e) Federally-enforceable requirements. All rules, programs, State or local permits, or other requirements approved under this subpart and all resulting part 70 operating permit conditions are enforceable by the Administrator and by citizens under the Act.
              (f) Standards not subject to modification or substitution. With respect to radionuclide emissions from licensees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or licensees of Nuclear Regulatory Commission Agreement States which are subject to part 61, subparts I, T, or W of this chapter, a State may request that the EPA approve delegation of implementation and enforcement of the Federal standard pursuant to § 63.91, but no changes or modifications in the form or content of the standard will be approved pursuant to § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, or § 63.97.
              (g) Selection of delegation options. (1) With the exception of paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section, States may only submit requests for approval of alternative requirements for a section 112 Federal rule, emission standard, or other requirement under a single delegation option under this subpart.
              (2) In the case of § 63.94 submittals, if the identified sources in any source category comprise a subset of the sources in that category, the State must accept delegation under one other section of this subpart for the remainder of the sources in that category that are required to be permitted by the State under part 70 of this chapter.

              (3) If the Administrator partially approves the State request per § 63.91(f), the State may submit a request for the remaining section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements in that category under another section of this subpart.
              [65 FR 55835, Sept. 14, 2000]
            
            
              § 63.91
              Criteria for straight delegation and criteria common to all approval options.
              (a) Applicable approval criteria. A State must satisfy the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section for up-front approval to obtain delegation of the Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements. Once a State has demonstrated it meets the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section, it only needs to reference that demonstration and reaffirm that it still meets the criteria in future submittals. In addition, a State must satisfy the applicable approval criteria in § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97, as specified in the following paragraphs.
              (1) Unchanged Federal section 112 rules (“straight delegation”). To obtain approval of State programs to implement and enforce Federal section 112 rules as promulgated without changes (except for accidental release programs, described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section), only the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section must be met. This includes State requests for one-time approval of their mechanism for taking delegation of future unchanged Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, and requirements as well as approval to implement and enforce unchanged Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, and requirements on a rule-by-rule basis.
              (2) State rules, programs, or requirements that are different from the Federal rule. To obtain approval under this subpart of a rule, program, or requirement that is different from the Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement, the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section and the criteria of either § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, or § 63.97 must be met.
              (3) Separable portions of State rules, programs, or requirements (“partial approval”). To obtain partial approval under this subpart, a State request must meet the criteria in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.
              (4) Programs under part 68 of this chapter, prevention of accidental releases. For approval of State rules or programs to implement and enforce the Federal accidental release prevention program in part 68 of this chapter, as promulgated without changes, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, and § 63.95 must be met. For approval of alternative requirements, the provisions of either § 63.92 or § 63.93 must also be met.
              (5) Limits on the potential to emit section 112 pollutants. The Administrator may, under the authority of section 112(l) and this subpart, also approve a State program designed to establish limits on the potential to emit hazardous air pollutants listed pursuant to section 112 of the Act.
              (b) Approval process. When a State submits an initial request for approval, and except as otherwise specified under § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97, for a State's subsequent requests for approval, the approval process will be as shown in the following table:
              
                
                  If . . .
                  Then . . .
                  And then . . .
                
                
                  (1) A request for approval is received
                  the Administrator will review the request for approval and determine whether the request is complete according to the criteria in this subpart
                  if a request is incomplete, the Administrator will notify the State of the specific deficient elements of the request.
                
                
                  (2) A complete request for approval is received

                  the Administrator will seek public comment for a minimum of 30 days through a Federal Register notice on the State's request for approval
                  the Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
                
                
                  (3) A complete request for approval is received and there has been a period of public comment
                  the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State rule, program, or requirement within 180 days of receipt of a complete request
                
                
                  
                  (4) The Administrator finds that all of the criteria of this section are met and all of the criteria of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 are met
                  the Administrator will approve or partially approve the State rule, program, or requirement
                  the Administrator will publish it in the Federal Register, and incorporate it directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63. Requirements approved under § 63.95 will be incorporated pursuant to requirements under part 68 of this chapter.
                
                
                  (5) The Administrator finds that any of the criteria of this section are not met, or any of the criteria of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 under which the request for approval was made are not met
                  the Administrator will notify the State of any revisions or additions necessary to obtain approval
                  any resubmittal by a State of a request for approval will be considered a new request under this subpart.
                
                
                  (6) A State rule, program, or requirement is disapproved
                  unless the State can revise the submittal to meet the criteria, the Administrator will disapprove the State rule, program, or requirement

                  the Administrator will publish the disapproval in the Federal Register.
                  
                
              
              (c) Enforcement. (1) Approval of the alternative rule, program, or requirement delegates to the State the authority to implement and enforce the approved rule, program, or requirement in lieu of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
              (i) The approved State rule, program, or requirement shall be federally enforceable from the date the Administrator signs the approval, with two exceptions. For States that implement unchanged Federal requirements (§ 63.91, straight delegation) via their title V permit program, and for States using the equivalency by permit option (63.94), the approved requirements shall be federally enforceable on the date of issuance or revision of the title V permit.
              (ii) In the case of a partial approval under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, only those authorities of the State request found to meet the requirements of this section will be approved; the remaining Federal authorities will be implemented and enforced by EPA.
              (iii) For partial approvals under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, only the portion of the State rule that is approved will be federally enforceable; the remainder continues to be State enforceable only.
              (2) When a State rule, program, or requirement is approved by the Administrator under this subpart, applicable title V permits shall be revised according to the provisions of § 70.7(f) of this chapter.

              (i) Each permit shall specify the origin of the alternative conditions per § 70.6 (a)(i) of this chapter and specifically reference the Federal Register notice or other EPA approval mechanism in the permit.
              (ii) When approved alternative requirements are incorporated in a permit, those requirements must be clearly identified and carried forward in any subsequent permit revisions or renewals. If the permit is not renewed, or if a revision or renewal does not carry the alternate requirements forward, then the Federal section 112 requirements become the applicable requirements.
              (3) If approval is withdrawn under § 63.96, all otherwise applicable Federal rules and requirements shall be enforceable in accordance with the compliance schedule established in the withdrawal notice and relevant title V permits shall be revised according to the provisions of § 70.7(f) of this chapter.
              (d) Criteria for approval. (1) Any request for approval under this subpart shall meet all section 112(l) approval criteria specified by the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement, all of the approval criteria of this section, and any additional approval criteria in § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97.
              (2) Once a State has satisfied the § 63.91(d) up-front approval requirements, it only needs to reference the previous demonstration and reaffirm that is still meets the criteria for any subsequent equivalency submittals.

              (3) Interim or final title V program approval will satisfy the criteria set forth in § 63.91(d), up-front approval criteria. Alternatively, the State must provide the following items in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (v) of this section to the Administrator:
              (i) A written finding by the State Attorney General (or for a local agency or tribal authority, the General Counsel with full authority to represent the local agency or tribal authority) that the State has the necessary legal authority to implement and to enforce the State rule, program, or requirement upon approval and to assure compliance by all sources within the State with each applicable section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. For full approval, the State must have the following legal authorities concerning enforcement and compliance assurance:
              (A) The State shall have enforcement authorities that meet the requirements of § 70.11 of this chapter, except that tribal authorities shall have enforcement authorities that meet the requirements of part 49 of this chapter, the Tribal Air Rule.
              (B) The State shall have authority to request information from regulated sources regarding their compliance status.
              (C) The State shall have authority to inspect sources and any records required to determine a source's compliance status.
              (D) If a State delegates authorities to a local agency, the State must retain enforcement authority unless the local agency has authorities that meet the requirements of § 70.11 of this chapter.
              (ii) A copy of State statutes, regulations, and requirements that contain the appropriate provisions granting authority to implement and enforce the State rule, program, or requirement upon approval.
              (iii) A demonstration that the State has adequate resources to implement and enforce all aspects of the rule, program, or requirement upon approval (except for authorities explicitly retained by the Administrator, such as those pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section or pursuant to part 49 of this chapter), which includes:
              (A) A description in narrative form of the scope, structure, coverage, and processes of the State program.
              (B) A description of the organization and structure of the agency or agencies that will have responsibility for administering the program.
              (C) A description of the agency's capacity to carry out the State program, including the number, occupation, and general duties of the employees.
              (iv) A schedule demonstrating expeditious State implementation of the rule, program, or requirement upon approval.
              (v) A plan that assures expeditious compliance by all sources subject to the State rule, program, or requirement upon approval. The plan should include, at a minimum, a complete description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program, including but not limited to inspection strategies.
              (4) If any of the State documents that are required to support an approval under this subpart are readily available to the EPA and to the public, the State may cite the relevant portions of the documents or indicate where they are available (e.g., by providing an Internet address) rather than provide copies.
              (5) Electronic documents. Submission of electronic documents shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).
              (e) Revisions. Within 90 days of any State amendment, repeal, or revision of any State rule, program, permit, or other requirement approved as an alternative to a Federal requirement or part of the authority necessary for the up-front approval, the State must provide the Administrator with a copy of the revised authorities and meet the requirements of either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.

              (1)(i) The State shall provide the Administrator with a written finding by the State Attorney General (or for a local agency or tribal authority, the General Counsel with full authority to represent the local agency or tribal authority) that the State's revised legal authorities are adequate to continue to implement and to enforce all previously approved State rules and the approved State program (as applicable) and adequate to continue to assure compliance by all sources within the State with approved rules, the approved program, the approved permit, or other requirements (as applicable) and each applicable section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
              (ii) If the Administrator determines that the written finding is not adequate, the State shall request approval of the revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement according to the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
              (2) The State shall request approval under this subpart for any revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement.
              (i) If the Administrator approves the revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement, the revision will replace the previously approved rule, program, permit, or other requirement.
              (ii) If the Administrator disapproves the revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement, the Administrator will initiate procedures under § 63.96 to withdraw approval of any previously approved rule, program, permit, or other requirement that may be affected by the revised authorities.
              (iii) Until such time as the Administrator approves or withdraws approval of a revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement, the previously approved rule, program, permit, or requirement remains federally enforceable and the revision is not federally enforceable.
              (3) If the EPA amends, or otherwise revises a promulgated section 112 rule or requirement in a way that increases its stringency, the EPA will notify any State which has received delegation under this subpart of the need to revise their equivalency demonstration.
              (i) The EPA Regional Office will consult with the affected State(s) to set a time frame for the State(s) to submit a revised equivalency demonstration.
              (ii) The revised equivalency demonstration will be reviewed and approved or disapproved according to the procedures set forth in this section and § 63.91, § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97, whichever are applicable.
              (f) Partial approval. The partial approval process under this subpart is described in the following table:
              
                
                  If . . .
                  Then . . .
                  And . . .
                
                
                  (1) A State's legal authorities submitted under this subpart substantially meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, but are not fully approvable
                  the Administrator may grant a partial approval with the State's consent
                  The EPA will continue to implement and enforce those authorities under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section that are not approved.
                
                
                  (2) Any of the other requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)-(v) of this section are not approvable
                  the Administrator will disapprove the submittal
                
                
                  (3) A rule, requirement, or program submitted under this subpart meets the requirements of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 as appropriate, with the exception of a separable portion of that rule, requirement, or program
                  the Administrator may remove that separable portion with the State's consent
                  the Administrator may then grant a partial approval of the portion of the rule, requirement, or program that meets the requirements of this subpart.
                
                
                  (4) the Administrator determines that there are too many areas of deficiency or that separating the responsibilities between Federal and State government would be too cumbersome and complex
                  the Administrator may disapprove the submittal in its entirety
                
              
              (g) Subpart A, Delegable authorities. A State may exercise certain authorities granted to the Administrator under subpart A, but may not exercise others, according to the following criteria:
              (1) A State may ask the appropriate EPA Regional Office to delegate any of the authorities listed as “Category I”, in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. The EPA Regional Office will delegate any such authorities at their discretion.
              (i) “Category I” shall consist of the following authorities:

The Regional Office may audit the State-approved alternatives and disapprove any that it determines are inappropriate, after discussion with the State. If changes are disapproved, the State must notify the source that it must revert to the original applicable monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and/or reporting requirements (either those requirements of the original section 112 requirement, the alternative requirements approved under this subpart, or the previously approved site-specific alternative requirements). Also, in cases where the source does not maintain the conditions which prompted the approval of the alternatives to the monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and/or reporting requirements, the State (or EPA Regional Office) must require the source to revert to the original monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, or more stringent requirements, if justified.
              (2)(i) A State may not ask the appropriate EPA Regional Office to delegate any of the authorities listed as “Category II” in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

              § 63.92
              Approval of State requirements that adjust a section 112 rule.
              Under this section a State may seek approval of State requirements that make pre-approved adjustments to a Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement that are unambiguously no less stringent than the Federal rule, emission standard, or requirement.
              (a) Approval process. (1) If the Administrator finds that the criteria of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State requirements, publish them in the Federal Register, and incorporate them, directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63, without additional notice and opportunity for comment. Requirements approved under § 63.95 will be incorporated pursuant to requirements under part 68 of this chapter.

              (2) If the Administrator finds that any one of the State adjustments to the Federal rule is in any way ambiguous with respect to the stringency of applicability, level of control, compliance and enforcement measures, or the compliance date for any affected source or emission point, the Administrator will either disapprove the State request or consider the request under § 63.93.

              (3) Within 60 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this section, the Administrator will either approve or disapprove the State request. If approved, the change will be effective upon signature of the Federal Register notice.
              (4) Requirements submitted for approval under this section shall include either title V permits, title V general permits, Federal new source review permits, or State rules. Permits must already be issued to be used under this section.
              (5) If the State uses a permit as the basis of alternative requirements under this section, the relevant permit terms and conditions must remain applicable to the source, even if the source takes steps that would otherwise release it from an obligation to have a permit.
              (b) Criteria for approval. Any request for approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this section and § 63.91 before approval. The State shall provide the Administrator with:
              (1) A demonstration that the public within the State has had adequate notice and opportunity to submit written comment on the State requirements, and
              (2) A demonstration that each State adjustment to the Federal rule individually results in requirements that:
              (i) Are unequivocally no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal rule with respect to applicability;
              (ii) Are unequivocally no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal rule with respect to level of control for each affected source and emission point;
              (iii) Are unequivocally no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal rule with respect to compliance and enforcement measures for each affected source and emission point; and
              (iv) Assure compliance by every affected source no later than would be required by the otherwise applicable Federal rule.
              (3) State adjustments to Federal section 112 rules which may be part of an approved rule under this section are:
              (i) Lowering a required emission rate or de minimis level;
              (ii) Adding a design, work practice, operational standard, emission rate or other such requirement;
              (iii) Increasing a required control efficiency;
              (iv) Increasing the frequency of required reporting, testing, sampling or monitoring;
              (v) Adding to the amount of information required for records or reports;
              (vi) Decreasing the amount of time to come into compliance;
              (vii) Subjecting additional emission points or sources within a source category to control requirements;
              (viii) Any adjustments allowed in a specific section 112 rule;
              (ix) Minor editorial, formatting, and other nonsubstantive changes; or
              (x) Identical alternative requirements previously approved by the Administrator in another local agency within the same State, if previously noticed that the alternative requirements would be applicable in the jurisdiction seeking approval under this section.

              § 63.93
              Approval of State requirements that substitute for a section 112 rule.
              Under this section a State may seek approval of State requirements which differ from a Federal section 112 rule for which they would substitute, such that the State requirements do not qualify for approval under § 63.92.
              (a) Approval process. (1) After receiving a complete request for approval under this section and making a preliminary determination on its equivalence, the Administrator will seek public comment on the State's request for a minimum of 30 days through a Federal Register notice. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
              

              (2) If, after review of public comments and any State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State requirements under this section, publish the approved requirements in the Federal Register, and incorporate them directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63. Requirements approved under § 63.95 will be incorporated pursuant to requirements under part 68 of this chapter.
              (3) If the Administrator finds that any of the requirements of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator may partially approve or disapprove the State requirements. For any partial approvals or disapprovals, the Administrator will provide the State with the basis for the partial approval or disapproval and what actions that State can take to make the requirements approvable.
              (4) Requirements submitted for approval under this section shall include either: State rules, title V permits, title V general permits, Federal new source review permits, board and administrative orders, permits issued pursuant to permit templates, or State operating permits. Permits must already be issued to be used under this section.
              (5) If the State uses a permit as the basis of alternative requirements under this section, the relevant permit terms and conditions must remain applicable to the source even if it takes steps that would otherwise release it from an obligation to have a permit.
              (6) Within 180 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this section, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request.
              (b) Criteria for approval. Any request for approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this section and § 63.91 before approval. The State shall provide the Administrator with detailed documentation that the State requirements contain or demonstrate:
              (1) Applicability criteria that are no less stringent than those in the respective Federal rule;
              (2) Levels of control (including associated performance test methods) and compliance and enforcement measures that result in emission reductions from each affected source or accidental release prevention program requirements for each affected source that are no less stringent than would result from the otherwise applicable Federal rule;
              (3) A compliance schedule that requires each affected source to be in compliance within a time frame consistent with the deadlines established in the otherwise applicable Federal rule; and
              (4) At a minimum, the approved State requirements must include the following compliance and enforcement measures. (For requirements addressing the accidental release prevention program, minimum compliance and enforcement provisions are described in § 63.95.)
              (i) The approved requirements must include monitoring or another method for determining compliance.
              (ii) If a standard in the approved rule is not instantaneous, a maximum averaging time must be established.
              (iii) The requirements must establish an obligation to periodically monitor for compliance using the monitoring or another method established in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section sufficient to yield reliable data that are representative of the source's compliance status.

              § 63.94
              Approval of State permit terms and conditions that substitute for a section 112 rule.
              Under this section a State may seek approval of State permit terms and conditions to be implemented and enforced in lieu of specified existing and future Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements promulgated under section 112, for those affected sources permitted by the State under part 70 of this chapter. The State may not seek approval under this section for permit terms and conditions that implement and enforce part 68 requirements.
              (a) Up-front approval process. (1) A State must submit a request that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. After receiving a complete request for approval of a State program under this section and making a preliminary determination of equivalence, the Administrator will seek public comment for 21 days through a Federal Register notice. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.

              (2) If, after review of all public comments, and State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State program. The approved program will be published in the Federal Register and incorporated directly or by reference in the appropriate subpart of part 63.
              (3) If the Administrator finds that any of the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator will partially approve or disapprove the State program. For any partial approvals or disapprovals, the Administrator will provide the State with the basis for the partial approval or disapproval and what action the State can take to make the programs approvable.
              (4) Within 90 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this section, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request.
              (b) Criteria for up-front approval. Any request for program approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this paragraph and § 63.91 before approval. The State shall provide the Administrator with:
              (1)(i) To the extent possible, an identification of all specific sources in source categories listed pursuant to subsection 112(c) for which the State is seeking authority to implement and enforce alternative requirements under this section;
              (ii) If the identified sources in any source category comprise a subset of the sources in that category within the State's jurisdiction, the State shall request delegation for the remainder of the sources in that category that are required to be permitted by the State under part 70 of this chapter. The State shall request delegation for the remainder of the sources in that category under another section of this subpart.
              (iii) Prior to submitting a request for one or more sources within a source category, the State shall consult with their EPA Regional Office regarding the number of sources in a category eligible for submittal under this option. Based on the Regional Office's decision, the State shall limit the number of sources for which it submits permit requirements.
              (2) To the extent possible, an identification of all existing and future section 112 emission standards for which the State is seeking authority under this section to implement and enforce alternative requirements.
              (3) If, after approval of the initial list of source categories identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State adds source categories for approval under this option, the State shall submit an addendum to the up-front approval submission, and identify the addition to the lists. The Administrator will follow the process outlined in paragraph (a) of this section for up-front approval.
              (4) A one-time demonstration that the State has an approved title V operating permit program and that the program permits the affected sources.
              (c) Approval process for alternative requirements. (1) After promulgation of a Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement for which the State has up-front approval to implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions, the State shall provide the Administrator with pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions that are sufficient, in the Administrator's judgement, to allow the Administrator to determine equivalency. The permit terms and conditions shall reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
              (2) [Reserved]

              (3) If, the Administrator receives a complete request and finds the pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions submitted by the State meet the criteria of paragraph (d), the Administrator will approve the State's alternative requirements (by approving the pre-draft permit terms and conditions) and notify the State in writing of the approval.
              (4) The Administrator may approve the State's alternative requirements on the condition that the State makes certain changes to the pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions and includes the changes in the complete pre-draft, proposed, and final title V permits for the affected sources. If the Administrator approves the alternative requirements on the condition that the State makes certain changes to them, the State shall make those changes or the alternative requirements will not be federally enforceable when they are included in the final permit, even if the Administrator does not object to the proposed permit. Until the Administrator affirmatively approves the State's alternative requirements (by approving the pre-draft permit terms and conditions) under this paragraph, and those requirements (permit terms) are incorporated into the final title V permit for any affected source, the otherwise applicable Federal emission standard(s) remain the federally enforceable and applicable requirements for that source.
              (5) If, after evaluating the pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions that were submitted by the State, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section have not been met, the Administrator will disapprove the State's alternative requirements and notify the State in writing of the disapproval. In the notice of disapproval, the Administrator will specify the deficient or nonapprovable elements of the State's alternative requirements.
              (6) Within 90 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this paragraph, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State's alternative requirements.
              (7) Nothing in this section precludes the State from submitting alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions or title V general permit terms and conditions for approval under this paragraph at the same time the State submits its program to the Administrator for up-front approval under paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the Federal emission standards for which the State submits alternative requirements are promulgated at the time of the State's submittal. If the Administrator finds that the criteria of § 63.91 and the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section are met, the Administrator will approve both the State program and the permit terms and conditions within 90 days of receiving a complete request for approval.
              (d) Approval criteria for alternative requirements. Any request for approval under this paragraph shall meet the following criteria. Taken together, the criteria in this paragraph describe the minimum contents of a State's equivalency demonstration for a promulgated Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. To be approvable, the State submittal must contain sufficient detail to allow the Administrator to make a determination of equivalency between the State's alternative requirements and the Federal requirements. Each submittal of alternative requirements in the form of pre-draft permit terms and conditions for an affected source shall:
              (1) Identify the specific, practicably enforceable terms and conditions with which the source would be required to comply upon issuance, renewal, or revision of the title V permit. The State shall submit permit terms and conditions that reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. The State shall identify for the Administrator the specific permit terms and conditions that contain alternative requirements.

              (2) Identify specifically how the alternative requirements in the form of permit terms and conditions are the same as or differ from the requirements in the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement (including any applicable requirements in subpart A or other subparts or appendices). The State shall provide this identification in a side-by-side comparison of the State's requirements in the form of permit terms and conditions and the requirements of the Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
              
              (3) The State shall provide the Administrator with detailed documentation that demonstrates that the alternative requirements meet the criteria specified in § 63.93(b), i.e., that the alternative requirements are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements.
              (e) Incorporation of permit terms and conditions into title V permits. (1) After approval of the State's alternative requirements under this section, the State shall incorporate the approved permit terms and conditions into title V permits for the affected sources. The State shall issue or revise the title V permits according to the provisions contained in § 70.7 of this chapter. The alternative permit terms and conditions may substitute for the Federal requirements once they are contained in a valid title V permit. If the State does not write the alternative conditions, exactly as approved, into the permit, EPA may reopen the permit for cause per § 70.7(g) of this chapter, and the delegation may not occur.
              (2) In the notice of pre-draft permit availability, and in each pre-draft, proposed, and final permit, the State shall indicate prominently that the permit contains alternative section 112 requirements. In the notice of pre-draft permit availability, the State shall specifically solicit public comment on the alternative requirements. In addition, the State shall attach all documents supporting the approved equivalency determination for those alternative requirements to each pre-draft, proposed, and final permit.

              § 63.95
              Additional approval criteria for accidental release prevention programs.
              (a) A State submission for approval of a part 68 program must meet the criteria and be in accordance with the procedures of this section, § 63.91, and, where appropriate, either § 63.92 or § 63.93.
              (b) The State part 68 program application shall contain the following elements consistent with the procedures in § 63.91 and, where appropriate, either § 63.92 or § 63.93 of this subpart, for at least the chemicals listed in part 68 subpart F (“federally-listed chemicals”) that an approvable State Accidental Release Prevention program is regulating:
              (1)(i) A demonstration of the State's authority and resources to implement and enforce regulations that are no less stringent than the regulations of part 68, subparts A through G and § 68.200 of this chapter; and
              (ii) A requirement that any source subject to the State's part 68 program submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that reports at least the same information in the same format as required under part 68, subpart G of this chapter.
              (2) A State's RMP program may require reporting of information not required by the Federal program, and these requirements (like any other additional State requirements) will become federally enforceable upon approval. The extent to which EPA will be able to help a State collect and report additional information through EPA's electronic RMP submission system will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
              (3) Procedures for reviewing risk management plans and providing technical assistance to stationary sources, including small businesses.
              (4) A demonstration of the State's authority to enforce all part 68 requirements must be made, including an auditing strategy that complies with § 68.220 of this chapter.
              (c) A State may request approval for a program that covers all of the federally-listed chemicals (a “complete program”) or a program covering less than all of the federally-listed chemicals (a “partial program”) as long as the State takes delegation of the full part 68 program for the federally-listed chemicals it regulates.

              § 63.96
              Review and withdrawal of approval.
              (a) Submission of information for review of approval. (1) The Administrator may at any time request any of the following information to review the adequacy of implementation and enforcement of an approved rule or program and the State shall provide that information within 45 days of the Administrator's request:
              
              (i) Copies of any State statutes, rules, regulations or other requirements that have amended, repealed or revised the approved State rule or program since approval or since the immediately previous EPA review;
              (ii) Information to demonstrate adequate State enforcement and compliance monitoring activities with respect to all approved State rules and with all section 112 rules, emission standards or requirements;
              (iii) Information to demonstrate adequate funding, staff, and other resources to implement and enforce the State's approved rule or program;
              (iv) A schedule for implementing the State's approved rule or program that assures compliance with all section 112 rules and requirements that the EPA has promulgated since approval or since the immediately previous EPA review,
              (v) A list of part 70 or other permits issued, amended, revised, or revoked since approval or since immediately previous EPA review, for sources subject to a State rule or program approved under this subpart.
              (vi) A summary of enforcement actions by the State regarding violations of section 112 requirements, including but not limited to administrative orders and judicial and administrative complaints and settlements.
              (2) Upon request by the Administrator, the State shall demonstrate that each State rule, emission standard or requirement applied to an individual source is no less stringent as applied than the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standard or requirement.
              (b) Withdrawal of approval of a state rule or program. (1) If the Administrator has reason to believe that a State is not adequately implementing or enforcing an approved rule or program according to the criteria of this section or that an approved rule or program is not as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standard or requirements, the Administrator will so inform the State in writing and will identify the reasons why the Administrator believes that the State's rule or program is not adequate. The State shall then initiate action to correct the deficiencies identified by the Administrator and shall inform the Administrator of the actions it has initiated and completed. If the Administrator determines that the State's actions are not adequate to correct the deficiencies, the Administrator will notify the State that the Administrator intends to withdraw approval and will hold a public hearing and seek public comment on the proposed withdrawal of approval. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State. Upon notification of the intent to withdraw, the State will notify all sources subject to the relevant approved rule or program that withdrawal proceedings have been initiated.
              (2) Based on any public comment received and any response to that comment by the State, the Administrator will notify the State of any changes in identified deficiencies or actions needed to correct identified deficiencies. If the State does not correct the identified deficiencies within 90 days after receiving revised notice of deficiencies, the Administrator shall withdraw approval of the State's rule or program upon a determination that:
              (i) The State no longer has adequate authorities to assure compliance or re-sources to implement and enforce the approved rule or program, or
              (ii) The State is not adequately implementing or enforcing the approved rule or program, or
              (iii) An approved rule or program is not as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standard or requirement.
              (3) The Administrator may withdraw approval for part of a rule, for a rule, for part of a program, or for an entire program.
              (4) Any State rule, program or portion of a State rule or program for which approval is withdrawn is no longer Federally enforceable. The Federal rule, emission standard or requirement that would have been applicable in the absence of approval under this will be the federally enforceable rule, emission standard or requirement.

              (i) Upon withdrawal of approval, the Administrator will publish an expeditious schedule for sources subject to the previously approved State rule or program to come into compliance with applicable Federal requirements. Such schedule shall include interim emission limits where appropriate. During this transition, sources must be operated in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.
              (ii) Upon withdrawal, the State shall reopen, under the provisions of § 70.7(f) of this chapter, the part 70 permit of each source subject to the previously approved rules or programs in order to assure compliance through the permit with the applicable requirements for each source.
              (iii) If the Administrator withdraws approval of State rules applicable to sources that are not subject to part 70 permits, the applicable State rules are no longer Federally enforceable.
              (iv) If the Administrator withdraws approval of a portion of a State rule or program, other approved portions of the State rule or program that are not withdrawn shall remain in effect.
              (v) Any applicable Federal emission standard or requirement shall remain enforceable by the EPA as specified in section 112(l)(7) of the Act.
              (5) If a rule approved under § 63.93 is withdrawn under the provisions of § 63.96(b)(2) (i) or (ii), and, at the time of withdrawal, the Administrator finds the rule to be no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal requirement, the Administrator will grant equivalency to the previously approved State rule under the appropriate provisions of this part.
              (6) A State may submit a new rule, program or portion of a rule or program for approval after the Administrator has withdrawn approval of the State's rule, program or portion of a rule or program. The Administrator will determine whether the new rule or program or portion of a rule or program is approvable according to the criteria and procedures of § 63.91 and either of § 63.92, § 63.93 or § 63.94.
              (7) A State may voluntarily withdraw from an approved State rule, program or portion of a rule or program by notifying the EPA and all affected sources subject to the rule or program and providing notice and opportunity for comment to the public within the State.
              (i) Upon voluntary withdrawal by a State, the Administrator will publish a timetable for sources subject to the previously approved State rule or program to come into compliance with applicable Federal requirements.
              (ii) Upon voluntary withdrawal, the State must reopen and revise the part 70 permits of all sources affected by the withdrawal as provided for in this section and § 70.7(f), and the Federal rule, emission standard, or requirement that would have been applicable in the absence of approval under this subpart will become the applicable requirement for the source.
              (iii) Any applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard or requirement shall remain enforceable by the EPA as specified in section 112(l)(7) of the Act.
              (iv) Voluntary withdrawal shall not be effective sooner than 180 days after the State notifies the EPA of its intent to voluntarily withdraw.

              Approval of a State program that substitutes for section 112 requirements.
              Under this section, a State may seek approval of a State program to be implemented and enforced in lieu of specified existing or future Federal emission standards or requirements promulgated under section 112. A State may not seek approval under this section for a program that implements and enforces part 68 requirements.
              (a) Up-front approval process. (1) After receiving a complete request for approval of a State program submitted under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and making a preliminary determination on whether to approve it, the Administrator will seek public comment for 21 days through a Federal Register notice. At its discretion, the State may include in this submittal a request for approval of specific alternative requirements under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3) The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.

              (4) If, after review of all public comments and State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve or partially approve the State program. The approved State program will be published in the Federal Register and incorporated, directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63.
              (5) If the Administrator finds that any of the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator will partially approve or disapprove the State program.
              (6) The Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request:
              (i) Within 90 days after receipt of a complete request for approval of a State program submitted under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section; or
              (ii) Within 180 days after receipt of a complete request for approval of a State program submitted under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (b) Criteria for up-front approval. Any request for program approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this paragraph and § 63.91 before approval.
              (1) For every request for program approval under this section, the State shall provide the Administrator, to the extent possible, with an identification of the initial specific source categories listed pursuant to section 112(c) and an identification of all existing and future section 112 emission standards or other requirements for which the State is seeking authority to implement and enforce alternative requirements under this section.
              (2) If, after approval of the initial list of specific source categories identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State adds source categories for approval under this option, the State shall submit an addendum to the approval submission, and identify the addition to the list.
              (3) In addition, the State may provide the Administrator with one or more of the following program elements for approval under this paragraph:
              (i) Alternative requirements in State rules, regulations, or general permits (or other enforceable mechanisms) that apply generically to one or more categories of sources and for which the State seeks approval to implement and enforce in lieu of specific existing Federal section 112 emission standards or requirements. The Administrator may approve or disapprove the alternative requirements in these rules, regulations, or permits when approving or disapproving the State's up-front submittal under this paragraph. After approval of the alternative generic rules, regulations or general permits, and after new Federal emission standards or requirements are promulgated, the State may extend the applicability of approved generic alternative requirements to additional source categories by repeating the approval process specified in paragraph (a) of this section. To be approvable, any request for approval of generic alternative requirements during the up-front approval process shall meet the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (ii) A description of the mechanisms that are enforceable as a matter of State law that the State will use to implement and enforce alternative requirements for area sources. The mechanisms that may be approved under this paragraph include title V permits, title V general permits, Federal new source review permits, board and administrative orders, permits issued pursuant to permit templates, state permits, and State rules that apply to categories of sources. The State shall demonstrate to the Administrator that the State has adequate resources and authorities to implement and enforce alternative section 112 requirements using the State mechanisms.
              (c) Approval process for alternative requirements. (1) After promulgation of a Federal emission standard or requirement for which the State has program approval under this section to implement and enforce alternative requirements, the State shall provide the Administrator with alternative requirements that are sufficient, in the Administrator's judgement, to allow the Administrator to determine equivalency under paragraph (d) of this section. The alternative requirements shall reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement, including any alternative requirements that the State is seeking to implement and enforce. Alternative requirements submitted for approval under this paragraph shall be contained in rules, regulations, general permits, or other mechanisms that apply to and are enforceable under State law for categories of sources. State policies are not approvable under this section unless they are incorporated into specific, enforceable, alternative requirements in rules, permits, or other mechanisms that apply to categories of sources.
              (2) [Reserved]

              (3) After receiving a complete request for approval under this section and making a preliminary determination on its equivalence, the Administrator will seek public comment for a minimum of 21 days through a Federal Register notice. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.

              (4) If, after review of public comments and any State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State's alternative requirements. The approved alternative requirements will be published in the Federal Register and incorporated, directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63.
              (5) If the Administrator finds that any of the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator will partially approve or disapprove the State's alternative requirements. For any partial approvals or disapprovals, the Administrator will provide the State with the basis for the partial approval or disapproval and what action the State can take to make the alternative requirements approvable.
              (6) Within 180 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this paragraph, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request.
              (7) Nothing in this section precludes the State from submitting alternative requirements for approval under this paragraph at the same time the State submits its program to the Administrator for up-front approval under paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the Federal rules, emission standards, or requirements for which the State submits alternative requirements are promulgated at the time of the State's submittal. If the Administrator finds that the criteria of § 63.91 and the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section are met, the Administrator will approve both the State program and the alternative requirements within 180 days of receiving a complete request for approval. Alternatively, following up-front approval, the State may submit alternative requirements for approval under this paragraph at any time after promulgation of the Federal emission standards or requirements.
              (d) Approval criteria for alternative requirements. Any request for approval under this paragraph shall meet the following criteria. Taken together, the criteria in this paragraph describe the minimum contents of a State's equivalency demonstration for a promulgated Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. To be approvable, the State submittal must contain sufficient detail to allow the Administrator to make a determination of equivalency between the State's alternative requirements and the Federal requirements. Each submittal of alternative requirements for a category of sources shall:
              (1) Include copies of all State rules, regulations, permits, or other enforceable mechanisms that contain the alternative requirements for which the State is seeking approval. These documents shall also contain requirements that reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rules, emission standards or requirements for which the State is not submitting alternatives. The State shall identify for the Administrator the specific requirements with which sources in a source category are required to comply, including the specific alternative requirements.

              (2) Identify specifically how the alternative requirements are the same as or differ from the requirements in the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standards, or requirements (including any applicable requirements in subpart A or other subparts or appendices). The State shall provide this identification in a side-by-side comparison of the State's requirements and the requirements of the Federal rule, emission standards, or requirements.
              (3) The State shall provide the Administrator with detailed documentation that demonstrates the State's belief that the alternative requirements meet the criteria specified in § 63.93(b) of this subpart, i.e., that the alternative requirements are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements.

              (ii) Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for International Paper Prattville Mill, Prattville, Alabama, for subpart MM of this part—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills. This action is contingent upon ADEM including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.

Any source seeking permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation, under sections 93109(d)(27) or (38), or (i)(3)(A)(2), Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, must also receive approval from the Administrator before using such alternative means of emission limitation for the purpose of complying with section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
              (iii) This delegation does not extend to the provisions regarding California's enforcement authorities or its collection of fees as described in Sections 93109.1(c) or 93109.2(c) and (d), Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. Approval of the California Code of Regulations, Title 17, sections 93109, 93109.1, and 93109.2 does not in any way limit the enforcement authorities, including the penalty authorities, of the Clean Air Act.
              (B) [Reserved]
              (C) The material incorporated in Chapter 3 of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Air Toxics Program (South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1421) pertains to the perchloroethylene dry cleaning source category in the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and has been approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of Subpart M—National Perchloroethylene Air Emission Standards for Dry Cleaning Facilities, as it applies to area sources only, as defined in § 63.320(h).
              (1) Authorities not delegated.
              (i) South Coast Air Quality Management District is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Rule 1421 in lieu of those provisions of Subpart M which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g). Dry cleaning facilities which are major sources remain subject to Subpart M.
              (ii) South Coast Air Quality Management District is not delegated the Administrator's authority of § 63.325 to determine equivalency of emissions control technologies. Any source seeking permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation, under sections (c)(17), (d)(3)(A)(v), (d)(4)(B)(ii)(III), and (j) of Rule 1421, must also receive approval from the Administrator before using such alternative means of emission limitation for the purpose of complying with section 112.
              (D) [Reserved]

              (E) The material incorporated in Chapter 5 of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Air Toxics Program (California Code of Regulations, Title 17, section 93102) pertains to the chromium electroplating and anodizing source category in the State of California, and has been approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of subpart N—National Emission Standards for Chromium Emissions from Hard and Decorative Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Tanks.
              (1) Title V requirements. Subpart N affected sources remain subject to both the Title V permitting requirements of § 63.340(e)(2) and, for major sources, the semi-annual submission of the ongoing compliance status reports as required by § 63.347(g).
              (2) Limits on maximum cumulative potential rectifier usage. Section 93102(h)(7)(B) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure allows facilities with a maximum cumulative potential rectifier capacity of greater than 60 million ampere-hours per year to be considered small or medium by accepting a limit on the maximum cumulative potential rectifier usage. All such usage limits in non-Title V operating permits are federally-enforceable for the purpose of this rule substitution.
              (3) Permitting Agencies' breakdown/malfunction rules. Section 93102(i)(4) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure provides that the owner or operator shall report breakdowns as required by the permitting agency's breakdown rule. Under this rule substitution, the permitting agencies' breakdown rules do not override or supplant the requirements of section 93102(g)(4), (h)(5), (h)(6), (i)(3)(B), or Appendix 3; neither expand the scope nor extend the time-frame of a breakdown beyond the definition of section 93102(b)(7); and do not grant the permitting agencies the authority to determine whether a breakdown has occurred, to grant emergency variances, or to decide to take no enforcement action. Owners or operators must submit written breakdown reports even if the permitting agency has not formally requested such reports.
              (4) Performance test requirements. Section 93102(d)(3)(A) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure allows the use of California Air Resources Board Method 425, dated July 28, 1997, and South Coast Air Quality Management District Method 205.1, dated August 1991, for determining chromium emissions. Any alternatives, modifications, or variations to these test methods must be approved under the procedures in section 93102(k) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure.

              (ii) Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GEPD) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for International Paper Augusta Mill, Augusta, Georgia, for subpart S of this part—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. This action is contingent upon GEPD including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.

              (20) Maine.
              (i) [Reserved]
              (ii) Maine Department of Environmental Protection (ME DEP) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for Lincoln Pulp and Paper, located in Lincoln, Maine, for subpart S—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. This action is contingent upon ME DEP including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the federal standard and have been approved by EPA. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.
              (iii) Affected area sources within Maine must comply with the Maine Regulations Applicable to Hazardous Air Pollutants (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14) as described in paragraph (a)(20)(iii)(A) of this section:
              (A) The material incorporated into the Maine Department of Environmental Protection regulations at Chapter 125, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaner Regulation, effective as of June 2, 1991, last amended on June 24, 2009, pertaining to dry cleaning facilities in the State of Maine jurisdiction, and approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of the Federal NESHAP for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Facilities (subpart M of this part), effective as of July 11, 2008, for area sources only, as defined in § 63.320(h).
              (1) Authorities not delegated.
              (i) Maine is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Maine regulations at Chapter 125, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M of this part which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g).
              (ii) Maine is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Maine regulations at Chapter 125, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M of this part which apply to dry cleaning systems installed in a building with a residence between July 13, 2006 and June 24, 2009, as defined in §§ 63.320(b)(2)(i) and 63.322(o)(4).

              (B) [Reserved]
              (21) Maryland. (i) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Maryland Department of the Environment, dated November 3, 1999, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.
              
              (ii) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Maryland Department of the Environment and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 30, 2002, effective April 1, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.
              (iii) EPA has granted the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the MDE may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM. The MDE may only establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The MDE must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and issue a CAA Title V permit for the Luke Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the MDE has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM.

              (30) New Hampshire. (i) New Hampshire is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards in accordance with the delegation procedures in Attachment II of the delegation request letter dated May 9, 2002 submitted by NH DES to EPA and any mutually acceptable amendments to those delegation procedures.

              (ii) New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NH DES) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for Groveton Paper Board Inc. of Groveton, NH and Pulp & Paper of America, LLC of Berlin, NH for subpart S—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry and subpart MM—National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite and Stand-Alone Semi-chemical Pulp Mills. This action is contingent upon NH DES including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard and have been approved by EPA. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.
              (iii) Affected inactive waste disposal sites not operated after July 9, 1981 within New Hampshire must comply with New Hampshire Regulations Chapter Env-Sw 2100: Management and Control of Asbestos Disposal Sites Not Operated after July 9, 1981, effective February 16, 2010 (incorporated by reference, see §  63.14) as described in paragraph (a)(30)(iii)(A) of this section:
              (A) The material incorporated by reference from Chapter Env-Sw 2100, Management and Control of Asbestos Disposal Sites Not Operated after July 9, 1981, pertains to inactive waste disposal sites not operated after July 9, 1981 in the State of New Hampshire's jurisdiction, and has been approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of the Federal NESHAPs for Inactive Waste Disposal Sites (40 CFR 61.151).
              (B) [Reserved]
              (iv) Affected asbestos facilities (i.e., facilities found under 40 CFR part 61, subpart M, except those listed under paragraph (a)(30)(iii)) of this section) must comply with the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, Chapter Env-A 1800, Asbestos Management and Control, effective as of May 5, 2017 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14) as described in paragraph (a)(30)(iv)(A) of this section:

              (B) [Reserved]
              (31) New Jersey. (i) Affected sources must comply with the Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act Program (TCPA), (July 20, 1998), (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14) as described in paragraph (a)(31)(i)(A) of this section:
              (A) Except for authorities identified as not being delegated, the regulations incorporated in New Jersey's “Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act Program,” Title 7, Chapter 31, of the New Jersey Administrative Code: Subchapter 1, “General Provisions” (sections 1.1 to 1.10 except for the definition of “What if Checklist”), Subchapter 2, “Hazard Assessment,” Subchapter 3, “Minimum Requirements for a Program 2 TCPA Risk Management Program,” Subchapter 4, “Minimum Requirements for a Program 3 TCPA Risk Management Program,” Subchapter 5, “Emergency Response,” Subchapter 6, “Extraordinarily Hazardous Substances,” Subchapter 7, “Risk Management Plan and TCPA Submission,” and Subchapter 8, “Other Federal Requirements,” (effective July 20, 1998), pertain to the sources affected by 40 CFR part 68 and have been approved under the procedures in §§ 63.91, 63.93 and 63.95 to be implemented and enforced in place of 40 CFR part 68, Subparts A through H, as may be amended.
              (1) Authorities not delegated:
              (i) The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act Program, Title 7, Chapter 31, of the New Jersey Administrative Code, in lieu of the provisions of 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to the regulation of processes that are covered only because they contain regulated quantities of liquid petroleum gases (LPG) regulated under the New Jersey Liquified Petroleum Gas Act of 1950 (N.J.S.A. 21:1B),
              (ii) Pursuant to § 63.90(c) the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is not delegated the Administrator's authority to add or delete substances from the list of substances established under section 112(r) and set forth in 40 CFR 68.130.

                  1 Authorities which may not be delegated include: § 63.6(g), Approval of Alternative Non-Opacity Emission Standards; § 63.6(h)(9), Approval of Alternative Opacity Standards; § 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f), Approval of Major Alternatives to Test Methods; § 63.8(f), Approval of Major Alternatives to Monitoring; § 63.10(f), Approval of Major Alternatives to Recordkeeping and Reporting; and all authorities identified in the subparts (e.g., under “Delegation of Authority”) that cannot be delegated.
                

                  2 Program delegated to New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) for standards promulgated by the EPA, as amended in the Federal Register through January 15, 2017.
                

                  3 Program delegated to Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board (ABCAQCB) for standards promulgated by the EPA, as amended in the Federal Register through September 13, 2013.
                

                  4 The NMED was previously delegated this subpart on February 9, 2004 (68 FR 69036). The ABCAQCB has adopted the subpart unchanged and applied for delegation of the standard. The subpart was vacated and remanded to the EPA by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See Mossville Environmental Action Network v. EPA, 370 F. 3d 1232 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Because of the D.C. Court's holding this subpart is not delegated to NMED or ABCAQCB at this time.
                

                  5 This subpart was issued a partial vacatur by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See 72 FR 61060 (October 29, 2007).
                
                  6 Final Rule. See 76 FR (March 21, 2011), as amended at 78 FR 7138 (January 31, 2013); 80 FR 72807 (November 20, 2015). Note that the ABCAQCB has not yet applied for updated delegation of these standards.
                

                  7 Final Promulgated Rule adopted by the EPA. See 80 FR 65470 (October 26, 2015). Note that Part 63 Subpart KKKKK was amended to correct minor typographical errors. See 80 FR 75817 (December 4, 2015). Note that the ABCAQCB has not yet applied for updated delegation of these standards.
                
                  8 Final Rule. See 77 FR 9304 (February 16, 2012), as amended 81 FR 20172 (April 6, 2016). Final Supplemental Finding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from Coal- and Oil-fired EUSGU Units. See 81 FR 24420 (April 25, 2016). Note that the ABCAQCB has not yet applied for updated delegation of these standards.

                  6 Final promulgated rule adopted by the EPA. See 80 FR 65470 (October 26, 2015). Note that Part 63 Subpart KKKKK was amended to correct minor typographical errors at 80 FR 75817 (December 4, 2015).
                
                  7 Final Rule. See 77 FR 9304 (February 16, 2012), as amended 81 FR 20172 (April 6, 2016). Final Supplemental Finding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from Coal- and Oil-fired EUSGU Units. See 81 FR 24420 (April 25, 2016).
              
              (38) Oregon. (i) The following table lists the delegation status of specific part 63 subparts that have been delegated to state and local air pollution control agencies in Oregon.

              (ii) South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for International Paper Georgetown Mill, Georgetown, South Carolina, for subpart S of this part—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. This action is contingent upon SC DHEC including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.
              (42)  [Reserved]
              (43) Tennessee. (i) The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which TDEC may establish and enforce alternative requirements for the Ellison Surface Technologies, Inc. facility located in Morgan County, Tennessee (Ellison) in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Plating and Polishing Operations at 40 CFR part 63, subpart WWWWWW, “National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Area Source Standards for Plating and Polishing Operations.” TDEC may only establish alternative requirements for Ellison that are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. TDEC must, in order to establish alternative requirements for Ellison under its EPA-approved EBP program: submit to the EPA for review pre-draft title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements that meet the criteria of 40 CFR 63.94(d), including the criterion that the alternative requirements are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements; obtain the EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft title V permit requirements; and issue a title V permit for Ellison that contains the approved alternative requirements. Until the EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and TDEC has issued a final title V permit incorporating them, Ellison will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart WWWWWW.

              (44) Texas. (i) The following table lists the specific part 63 standards that have been delegated unchanged to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for all sources. The “X” symbol is used to indicate each subpart that has been delegated. The delegations are subject to all of the conditions and limitations set forth in Federal law and regulations. Some authorities cannot be delegated and are retained by the EPA. These include certain General Provisions authorities and specific parts of some standards. Any amendments made to these rules after August 3, 2016 are not delegated.

                  1 Program delegated to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).
                

                  2 Authorities which may not be delegated include: § 63.6(g), Approval of Alternative Non-Opacity Emission Standards; § 63.6(h)(9), Approval of Alternative Opacity Standards; § 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f), Approval of Major Alternatives to Test Methods; § 63.8(f), Approval of Major Alternatives to Monitoring; § 63.10(f), Approval of Major Alternatives to Recordkeeping and Reporting; and all authorities identified in the subparts (e.g., under “Delegation of Authority”) that cannot be delegated.
                

                  3 TCEQ was previously delegated this subpart on May 17, 2005 (70 FR 13018). The subpart was vacated and remanded to the EPA by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See, Mossville Environmental Action Network v. EPA, 370 F. 3d 1232 (DC Cir. 2004). Because of the DC Court's holding, this subpart is not delegated to TCEQ at this time.
                
                  4 This subpart was issued a partial vacatur by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See 72 FR 61060 (October 29, 2007).
                
                  5 Final rule. See 76 FR 15608 (March 21, 2011), as amended at 78 FR 7138 (January 31, 2013); 80 FR 72807 (November 20, 2015).
                
                  6 Final promulgated rule adopted by the EPA. See 80 FR 65470 (October 26, 2015). Note that Part 63 Subpart KKKKK was amended to correct minor typographical errors. See 80 FR 75817 (December 4, 2015).
                
                  7 Final Rule. See 77 FR 9304 (February 16, 2012), as amended 81 FR 20172 (April 6, 2016). Final Supplemental Finding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from Coal- and Oil-fired EUSGU Units. See 81 FR 24420 (April 25, 2016).
              

              (ii) Affected sources within Texas shall comply with the Federal requirements of 40 CFR part 63—subpart A—General Provisions, adopted by reference by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), with the exception of § 63.5(e)(2)(i), § 63.6(i)(12)(i), § 63.6(i)(13)(i) and (ii), § 63.8(e)(5)(ii), § 63.9(i)(3), and § 63.10(e)(2)(ii). The TCEQ has adopted alternative provisions for the cited exceptions above and affected sources in Texas that are subject to the requirements of Subpart A shall comply with the requirements established at Texas Administrative Code, Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 113, Subchapter C, section 113.100.
              (45) [Reserved]
              (46) Vermont. (i) Affected area sources within Vermont must comply with Vermont Regulations applicable to Hazardous Air Pollutants (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14) as described in paragraph (a)(46)(i)(A) of this section:
              (A) The material incorporated into the Vermont Air Pollution Regulations at Chapter 5, Air Pollution Control, section 5-253.11, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning (effective as of December 15, 2016) pertaining to area source dry cleaning facilities in the State of Vermont jurisdiction, and approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of the requirements for area source dry cleaning facilities in the Federal NESHAP for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Facilities (subpart M of this part), effective as of July 11, 2008. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(46) the term “area source dry cleaning facilities” means any source that qualifies as an area source under § 63.320(h).
              (1) Authorities not delegated. (i) Vermont is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Vermont Air Pollution Control Regulations, Chapter 5, Air Pollution Control, section 5-253.11, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M of this part which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g).
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (2) [Reserved]
              (B) [Reserved]
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (47) Virginia. (i) Virginia is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, dated April 20, 1998, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.
              (ii) Virginia is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 8, 2002, effective March 11, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.
              (iii) EPA has granted the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the Virginia DEQ may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for International Paper Company's Franklin Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Pulp and Paper Industry found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart S. The Virginia DEQ may only establish alternative requirements for the Franklin Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The VA DEQ must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Franklin Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: (1) Submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, (2) obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and (3) issue a CAA Title V permit for the Franklin Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the Virginia DEQ has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, International Paper Company's Franklin Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart S.
              (48) Washington.

              § 63.100
              Applicability and designation of source.
              (a) This subpart provides applicability provisions, definitions, and other general provisions that are applicable to subparts G and H of this part.
              (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section, the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part apply to chemical manufacturing process units that meet all the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section:
              (1) Manufacture as a primary product one or more of the chemicals listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) One or more of the chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart; or
              (ii) One or more of the chemicals listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section:
              (A) Tetrahydrobenzaldehyde (CAS Number 100-50-5); or
              (B) Crotonaldehyde (CAS Number 123-73-9).
              (2) Use as a reactant or manufacture as a product, or co-product, one or more of the organic hazardous air pollutants listed in table 2 of this subpart;
              (3) Are located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in section 112(a) of the Act.
              (4) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing processing unit is exempt from all requirements of subparts F, G, and H of this part until not later than April 22, 1997 if the owner or operator certifies, in a notification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, not later than May 14, 1996, that the plant site at which the chemical manufacturing processing unit is located emits, and will continue to emit, during any 12-month period, less than 10 tons per year of any individual hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and less than 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP.
              (i) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are not federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) through (b)(4)(i)(C) and comply with the recordkeeping requirement in 63.103(f).
              (A) The owner or operator shall identify all HAP emission points at the plant site, including those emission points subject to and emission points not subject to subparts F, G, and H;

              (B) The owner or operator shall calculate the amount of annual HAP emissions released from each emission point at the plant site, using acceptable measurement or estimating techniques for maximum expected operating conditions at the plant site. Examples of estimating procedures that are considered acceptable include the calculation procedures in § 63.150 of subpart G, the early reduction demonstration procedures specified in §§ 63.74 (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (g), or accepted engineering practices. If the total annual HAP emissions for the plant site are annually reported under Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) section 313, then such reported annual emissions may be used to satisfy the requirements of § 63.100(b)(4)(i)(B).
              (C) The owner or operator shall sum the amount of annual HAP emissions from all emission points on the plant site. If the total emissions of any one HAP are less than 10 tons per year and the total emissions of any combination of HAP are less than 25 tons per year, the plant site qualifies for the exemption described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided that emissions are kept below these thresholds.
              (ii) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (c) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing process unit that meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section but does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product, any organic hazardous air pollutant listed in table 2 of this subpart shall comply only with the requirements of § 63.103(e) of this subpart. To comply with this subpart, such chemical manufacturing process units shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part.
              (d) The primary product of a chemical manufacturing process unit shall be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section.
              (1) If a chemical manufacturing process unit produces more than one intended chemical product, the product with the greatest annual design capacity on a mass basis determines the primary product of the process.
              (2) If a chemical manufacturing process unit has two or more products that have the same maximum annual design capacity on a mass basis and if one of those chemicals is listed in table 1 of this subpart, then the listed chemical is considered the primary product and the chemical manufacturing process unit is subject to this subpart. If more than one of the products is listed in table 1 of this subpart, then the owner or operator may designate as the primary product any of the listed chemicals and the chemical manufacturing process unit is subject to this subpart.
              (3) For chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units producing one or more chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart, the primary product shall be determined for existing sources based on the expected utilization for the five years following April 22, 1994 and for new sources based on the expected utilization for the first five years after initial start-up.
              (i) If the predominant use of the flexible operation unit, as described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section, is to produce one or more chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart, then the flexible operation unit shall be subject to the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part.
              (A) If the flexible operation unit produces one product for the greatest annual operating time, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
              (B) If the flexible operation unit produces multiple chemicals equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest annual production on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
              (ii) The determination of applicability of this subpart to chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units shall be reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority.

              (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, for chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units producing a chemical listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the primary product shall be determined for existing sources based on the expected utilization for the five years following May 12, 1998 and for new sources based on the expected utilization for the first five years after initial start-up.
              (i) The predominant use of the flexible operation unit shall be determined according to paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section. If the predominant use is to produce one of the chemicals listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, then the flexible operation unit shall be subject to the provisions of this subpart and subparts G and H of this part.

              § 63.102
              General standards.
              (a) Owners and operators of sources subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements of subparts G and H of this part.

              (1) The provisions set forth in this subpart F and subpart G of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of start-up or shutdown (as defined in § 63.101 of this subpart), malfunction, or non-operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart F and subpart G of this part apply. However, if a start-up, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation of one portion of a chemical manufacturing process unit does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart F and subpart G of this part during the start-up, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation. For example, if there is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel in the chemical manufacturing process unit would still be required to be controlled in accordance with § 63.119 of subpart G of the part. Similarly, the degassing of a storage vessel would not affect the ability of a process vent to meet the requirements of § 63.113 of subpart G of this part.
              (2) The provisions set forth in subpart H of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of start-up or shutdown, as defined in § 63.101(b) of this subpart, malfunction, process unit shutdown (as defined in § 63.161 of subpart H of this part), or non-operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which subpart H of this part applies.
              (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with the provisions of this subpart F, subpart G or H of this part during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart F, subpart G or H of this part applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or if the owner or operator must shut down the equipment to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of the chemical manufacturing process unit or portion thereof.
              (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the requirements of this subpart F, subparts G and/or H of this part do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in § 63.6(e)(3)), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. The measures to be taken may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if available.

              (b) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in organic HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in organic HAP emissions from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards in subpart G or H of this part, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.
              (1) The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (2) Any notice under paragraph (b) of this section shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (3) Any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions.
              (c) Each owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 from the appropriate permitting authority by the date determined by 40 CFR part 70 or part 71, as appropriate.

              (1) If the EPA has approved a State operating permit program under 40 CFR Part 70, the permit shall be obtained from the State authority. If the State operating permit program has not been approved, the source shall apply to the EPA Regional Office.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (d) The requirements in subparts F, G, and H of this part are Federally enforceable under section 112 of the Act on and after the dates specified in § 63.100(k) of this subpart.
              [59 FR 19454, Apr. 22, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 63626, Dec. 12, 1995; 61 FR 64575, Dec. 5, 1996; 62 FR 2732, Jan. 17, 1997; 71 FR 20455, Apr. 20, 2006]
            
            
              § 63.103
              General compliance, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions.
              (a) Table 3 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of sources subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part.
              (b) Initial performance tests and initial compliance determinations shall be required only as specified in subparts G and H of this part.
              (1) Performance tests and compliance determinations shall be conducted according to the schedule and procedures in § 63.7(a) of subpart A of this part and the applicable sections of subparts G and H of this part.
              (2) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.
              (3) Performance tests shall be conducted according to the provisions of § 63.7(e) of subpart A of this part, except that performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process. During the performance test, an owner or operator may operate the control or recovery device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control or recovery device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction.
              (4) Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA-approved methods specified in the applicable subpart or, if other test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part.
              (5) Performance tests may be waived with approval of the Administrator as specified in § 63.7(h)(2) of subpart A of this part. Owners or operators of sources subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part who apply for a waiver of a performance test shall submit the application by the dates specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section rather than the dates specified in § 63.7(h)(3) of subpart A of this part.
              (i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under § 63.151(a)(6) of subpart G or § 63.6(i) of subpart A of this part, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted no later than 90 calendar days before the Notification of Compliance Status required in § 63.152(b) of subpart G of this part is due to be submitted.
              (ii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the source performing the required test.

              (6) The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit shall conduct all required compliance demonstrations during production of the primary product. The owner or operator is not required to conduct compliance demonstrations for operating conditions during production of a product other than the primary product. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart or in subpart G or subpart H of this part, as applicable, the owner or operator shall operate each control device, recovery device, and/or recapture device that is required or used for compliance, and associated monitoring systems, without regard for whether the product that is being produced is the primary product or a different product. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, subpart G and/or subpart H of this part, as applicable, operation of a control device, recapture device and/or recovery device required or used for compliance such that the daily average of monitored parameter values is outside the parameter range established pursuant to § 63.152(b)(2), or such that the monitoring data show operation inconsistent with the monitoring plan established pursuant to § 63.120(d)(2) or § 63.181(g)(1)(iv), shall constitute a violation of the required operating conditions.
              (c) Each owner or operator of a source subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part shall keep copies of all applicable reports and records required by subparts F, G, and H of this part for at least 5 years; except that, if subparts G or H require records to be maintained for a time period different than 5 years, those records shall be maintained for the time specified in subpart G or H of this part. If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the applicable EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of § 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports.
              (1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining four and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
              (2) The owner or operator subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part shall keep the records specified in this paragraph, as well as records specified in subparts G and H.
              (i) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or of air pollution control equipment or continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this subpart F, subpart G, or H of this part during which excess emissions (as defined in § 63.102(a)(4)) occur.
              (ii) For each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions (as defined in § 63.102(a)(4)) occur, records that the procedures specified in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing a control device to a backup control device (e.g., the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
              (iii) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with subpart G of this part, records documenting the completion of calibration checks and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
              (3) Records of start-up, shutdown and malfunction and continuous monitoring system calibration and maintenance are not required if they pertain solely to Group 2 emission points, as defined in § 63.111 of subpart G of this part, that are not included in an emissions average.
              (d) All reports required under subparts F, G, and H of this part shall be sent to the Administrator at the addresses listed in § 63.13 of subpart A of this part, except that requests for permission to use an alternative means of compliance as provided for in § 63.102(b) of this subpart and application for approval of a nominal efficiency as provided for in § 63.150 (i)(1) through (i)(6) of subpart G of this part shall be submitted to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards rather than to the Administrator or delegated authority.

              (1) Wherever subpart A of this part specifies “postmark” dates, submittals may be sent by methods other than the U.S. Mail (e.g., by fax or courier). Submittals shall be sent on or before the specified date.
              (2) If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, reports may be submitted on electronic media.
              (e) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing process unit which meets the criteria of § 63.100(b)(1) and § 63.100(b)(3), but not the criteria of § 63.100(b)(2), shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
              (1) Retain information, data, and analysis used to determine that the chemical manufacturing process unit does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product any organic hazardous air pollutant. Examples of information that could document this include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
              (2) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the chemical manufacturing process unit does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product any organic hazardous air pollutant.
              (f) To qualify for the exemption specified in § 63.100(b)(4) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall maintain the documentation of the information required pursuant to § 63.100(b)(4)(i), and documentation of any update of this information requested by the EPA Regional Office, and shall provide the documentation to the EPA Regional Office upon request. The EPA Regional Office will notify the owner or operator, after reviewing such documentation, if the source does not qualify for the exemption specified in § 63.100(b)(4) of this section. In such cases, compliance with subpart H shall be required no later than 90 days after expiration of the applicable compliance date in § 63.100(k)(3), but in no event earlier than 90 days after the date of such notification by the EPA Regional Office. Compliance with this subpart F and subpart G of this part shall be no later than April 22, 1997, or as otherwise specified in § 63.100(k)(2)(ii) of this subpart, unless an extension has been granted by the EPA Regional Office or permitting authority as provided in § 63.6(i) of subpart A of this part.
              (g) An owner or operator who elects to use the compliance extension provisions of § 63.100(k)(6)(i) or (ii) shall submit a compliance extension request to the appropriate EPA Regional Office no later than 45 days before the applicable compliance date in § 63.100(k)(3), but in no event is submittal required earlier than May 10, 1995. The request shall contain the information specified in § 63.100(k)(5)(iv) and the reason compliance can not reasonably be achieved without a process unit shutdown, as defined in 40 CFR 63.161 or without replacement of the compressor or recasting of the distance piece.
              (h) An owner or operator who elects to use the compliance extension provisions of § 63.100(k)(8) shall submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office a brief description of the process change, identify the HAP eliminated, and the expected date of cessation of use or production of HAP. The description shall be submitted no later than May 10, 1995, or with the Notice of Compliance Status as required in § 63.182(c) of subpart H, whichever is later.

              § 63.104
              Heat exchange system requirements.
              (a) Unless one or more of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section are met, owners and operators of sources subject to this subpart shall monitor each heat exchange system used to cool process equipment in a chemical manufacturing process unit meeting the conditions of § 63.100 (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this subpart, except for chemical manufacturing process units meeting the condition specified in § 63.100(c) of this subpart, according to the provisions in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. Whenever a leak is detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.

              (1) The heat exchange system is operated with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process side.
              (2) There is an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5 percent by weight of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid serves to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and the intervening fluid is not sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.
              (3) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with an allowable discharge limit of 1 part per million or less above influent concentration or 10 percent or less above influent concentration, whichever is greater.
              (4) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to an NPDES permit that:
              (i) Requires monitoring of a parameter(s) or condition(s) to detect a leak of process fluids into cooling water;
              (ii) Specifies or includes the normal range of the parameter or condition;
              (iii) Requires monitoring for the parameters selected as leak indicators no less frequently than monthly for the first six months and quarterly thereafter; and
              (iv) Requires the owner or operator to report and correct leaks to the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal range.
              (5) The recirculating heat exchange system is used to cool process fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.
              (6) The once-through heat exchange system is used to cool process fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 9 of subpart G of this part.
              (b) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring the cooling water for the presence of one or more organic hazardous air pollutants or other representative substances whose presence in cooling water indicates a leak shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section. The cooling water shall be monitored for total hazardous air pollutants, total volatile organic compounds, total organic carbon, one or more speciated HAP compounds, or other representative substances that would indicate the presence of a leak in the heat exchange system.
              (1) The cooling water shall be monitored monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
              (2)(i) For recirculating heat exchange systems (cooling tower systems), the monitoring of speciated hazardous air pollutants or total hazardous air pollutants refers to the hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.
              (ii) For once-through heat exchange systems, the monitoring of speciated hazardous air pollutants or total hazardous air pollutants refers to the hazardous air pollutants listed in table 9 of subpart G of this part.
              (3) The concentration of the monitored substance(s) in the cooling water shall be determined using any EPA-approved method listed in part 136 of this chapter as long as the method is sensitive to concentrations as low as 10 parts per million and the same method is used for both entrance and exit samples. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.
              (4) The samples shall be collected either at the entrance and exit of each heat exchange system or at locations where the cooling water enters and exits each heat exchanger or any combination of heat exchangers.
              (i) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of recirculating heat exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water leaves the cooling tower prior to being returned to the process equipment and the exit is the point at which the cooling water is introduced to the cooling tower after being used to cool the process fluid.
              (ii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of once-through heat exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water enters and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the plant site or chemical manufacturing process units.

              (iii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of each heat exchanger or any combination of heat exchangers in chemical manufacturing process units, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water enters the individual heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers.
              (5) A minimum of three sets of samples shall be taken at each entrance and exit as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The average entrance and exit concentrations shall then be calculated. The concentration shall be corrected for the addition of any makeup water or for any evaporative losses, as applicable.
              (6) A leak is detected if the exit mean concentration is found to be greater than the entrance mean using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance and the amount by which it is greater is at least 1 part per million or 10 percent of the entrance mean, whichever is greater.
              (c) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring using a surrogate indicator of heat exchange system leaks shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity or other representative indicators.
              (1) The owner or operator shall prepare and implement a monitoring plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of process fluids into cooling water. The plan shall require monitoring of one or more surrogate indicators or monitoring of one or more process parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably indicate the presence of a leak.
              (ii) The parameter level(s) or conditions(s) that shall constitute a leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, a leak is indicated.
              (iii) The monitoring frequency which shall be no less frequent than monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
              (iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with the requirements of this section.
              (2) If a substantial leak is identified by methods other than those described in the monitoring plan and the method(s) specified in the plan could not detect the leak, the owner or operator shall revise the plan and document the basis for the changes. The owner or operator shall complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.
              (3) The owner or operator shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is superseded, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded plan at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within two hours after a request) for at least 6 months after its creation.
              (d) If a leak is detected according to the criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.

              (1) The leak shall be repaired as soon as practical but not later than 45 calendar days after the owner or operator receives results of monitoring tests indicating a leak. The leak shall be repaired unless the owner or operator demonstrates that the results are due to a condition other than a leak.
              (2) Once the leak has been repaired, the owner or operator shall confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired within 7 calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later.
              (e) Delay of repair of heat exchange systems for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the equipment is isolated from the process. Delay of repair is also allowed if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and any one of the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section is met. All time periods in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall be determined from the date when the owner or operator determines that delay of repair is necessary.
              (1) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months, a special shutdown before that planned shutdown is not required.
              (2) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months, the owner or operator may delay repair as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Documentation of a decision to delay repair shall state the reasons repair was delayed and shall specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
              (i) If a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair, the owner or operator may delay repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. The owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delaying repair as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
              (A) The owner or operator shall calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart in the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flowrate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the expected duration of the delay. The owner or operator may calculate potential emissions using total organic carbon concentration instead of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.
              (B) The owner or operator shall determine emissions from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.
              (ii) If repair is delayed for reasons other than those specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may delay repair up to a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner shall demonstrate that the necessary parts or personnel were not available.
              (f)(1) Required records. The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iv) of this section as specified in § 63.103(c)(1).
              (i) Monitoring data required by this section indicating a leak and the date when the leak was detected, and if demonstrated not to be a leak, the basis for that determination;
              (ii) Records of any leaks detected by procedures subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the date the leak was discovered;
              (iii) The dates of efforts to repair leaks; and
              (iv) The method or procedure used to confirm repair of a leak and the date repair was confirmed.
              (2) Reports. If an owner or operator invokes the delay of repair provisions for a heat exchange system, the following information shall be submitted in the next semi-annual periodic report required by § 63.152(c) of subpart G of this part. If the leak remains unrepaired, the information shall also be submitted in each subsequent periodic report, until repair of the leak is reported.
              (i) The owner or operator shall report the presence of the leak and the date that the leak was detected.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall report whether or not the leak has been repaired.

              (iii) The owner or operator shall report the reason(s) for delay of repair. If delay of repair is invoked due to the reasons described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, documentation of emissions estimates must also be submitted.
              
              (iv) If the leak remains unrepaired, the owner or operator shall report the expected date of repair.
              (v) If the leak is repaired, the owner or operator shall report the date the leak was successfully repaired.

              (b) The owner or operator shall prepare a description of maintenance procedures for management of wastewaters generated from the emptying and purging of equipment in the process during temporary shutdowns for inspections, maintenance, and repair (i.e., a maintenance-turnaround) and during periods which are not shutdowns (i.e., routine maintenance). The descriptions shall:
              (1) Specify the process equipment or maintenance tasks that are anticipated to create wastewater during maintenance activities.
              (2) Specify the procedures that will be followed to properly manage the wastewater and control organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere; and
              (3) Specify the procedures to be followed when clearing materials from process equipment.

              Identification of process vents subject to this subpart.

              (a) The owner or operator shall use the criteria specified in this § 63.107 to determine whether there are any process vents associated with an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor that is in a source subject to this subpart. A process vent is the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any) of a gas stream if the gas stream has the characteristics specified in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, or meets the criteria specified in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (b) Some, or all, of the gas stream originates as a continuous flow from an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor during operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit.
              (c) The discharge to the atmosphere (with or without passing through a control device) meets at least one of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Is directly from an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor; or
              (2) Is from an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor after passing solely (i.e., without passing through any other unit operation for a process purpose) through one or more recovery devices within the chemical manufacturing process unit; or
              (3) Is from a device recovering only mechanical energy from a gas stream that comes either directly from an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor, or from an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor after passing solely (i.e., without passing through any other unit operation for a process purpose) through one or more recovery devices within the chemical manufacturing process unit.
              (d) The gas stream contains greater than 0.005 weight percent total organic HAP at the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or at the point of entry into a control device, if any).
              (e) The air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor is part of a chemical manufacturing process unit that meets the criteria of § 63.100(b).
              (f) The gas stream is in the gas phase from the point of origin at the air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor to the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or to the point of entry into a control device, if any).
              (g) The gas stream is discharged to the atmosphere either on-site, off-site, or both.
              (h) The gas stream is not any of the items identified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (9) of this section.
              (1) A relief valve discharge.
              (2) A leak from equipment subject to subpart H of this part.
              (3) A gas stream going to a fuel gas system as defined in § 63.101.
              (4) A gas stream exiting a control device used to comply with § 63.113.
              (5) A gas stream transferred to other processes (on-site or off-site) for reaction or other use in another process (i.e., for chemical value as a product, isolated intermediate, byproduct, or coproduct, or for heat value).
              (6) A gas stream transferred for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse.
              (7) A storage vessel vent or transfer operation vent subject to § 63.119 or § 63.126.
              (8) A vent from a waste management unit subject to §§ 63.132 through 63.137.
              (9) A gas stream exiting an analyzer.
              (i) The gas stream would meet the characteristics specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, but, for purposes of avoiding applicability, has been deliberately interrupted, temporarily liquefied, routed through any item of equipment for no process purpose, or disposed of in a flare that does not meet the criteria in § 63.11(b), or an incinerator that does not reduce emissions of organic HAP by 98 percent or to a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent.

                ER22AP94.205

              (e) The owner or operator of a Group 2 process vent shall recalculate the TRE index value, flow, or organic hazardous air pollutants concentration for each process vent, as necessary to determine whether the vent is Group 1 or Group 2, whenever process changes are made that could reasonably be expected to change the vent to a Group 1 vent. Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in production capacity, production rate, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, process changes do not include: Process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are within the range on which the original TRE calculation was based.
              (1) The TRE index value, flow rate, or organic HAP concentration shall be recalculated based on measurements of vent stream flow rate, TOC, and organic HAP concentrations, and heating values as specified in § 63.115 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this subpart, as applicable, or on best engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

              (f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, in any case where a process vent includes one or more gas streams that are not from a source subject to this subpart (hereafter called “non-HON streams” for purposes of this paragraph), and one or more gas streams that meet the criteria in § 63.107(b) through (h) or the criteria in § 63.107(i) (hereafter called “HON streams” for purposes of this paragraph), the owner or operator may elect to comply with paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator may determine the characteristics (flow rate, total organic HAP concentration, and TRE index value) for each HON stream, or combination of HON streams, at a representative point as near as practical to, but before, the point at which it is combined with one or more non-HON streams.
              (2) If one or more of the HON streams, or combinations of HON streams, has the characteristics (determined at the location specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) associated with a Group 1 process vent, the combined vent stream is a Group 1 process vent. Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if none of the HON streams, or combinations of HON streams, when determined at the location specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, has the characteristics associated with a Group 1 process vent, the combined vent stream is a Group 2 process vent regardless of the TRE index value determined at the location specified in § 63.115(a). If the combined vent stream is a Group 2 process vent as determined by the previous sentence, but one or more of the HON streams, or combinations of HON streams, has a TRE index value greater than 1 but less than or equal to 4, the combined vent stream is a process vent with a TRE index value greater than 1 but less than or equal to 4. In this case, the owner or operator shall monitor the combined vent stream as required by § 63.114(b).
              (3) Paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section are not intended to apply instead of any other subpart of this part. If another subpart of this part applies to one or more of the non-HON streams contributing to the combined vent stream, that subpart may impose emission control requirements such as, but not limited to, requiring the combined vent stream to be classified and controlled as a Group 1 process vent.

              (g) Off-site treatment or on-site treatment not owned or operated by the source. The owner or operator may elect to transfer a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream to an on-site treatment operation not owned or operated by the owner or operator of the source generating the wastewater stream or residual, or to an off-site treatment operation.
              (1) The owner or operator transferring the wastewater stream or residual shall:
              (i) Comply with the provisions specified in §§ 63.133 through 63.137 of this subpart for each waste management unit that receives or manages a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream prior to shipment or transport.
              (ii) Include a notice with the shipment or transport of each Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream. The notice shall state that the wastewater stream or residual contains organic hazardous air pollutants that are to be treated in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. When the transport is continuous or ongoing (for example, discharge to a publicly-owned treatment works), the notice shall be submitted to the treatment operator initially and whenever there is a change in the required treatment.

              (2) The owner or operator may not transfer the wastewater stream or residual unless the transferee has submitted to the EPA a written certification that the transferee will manage and treat any Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream received from a source subject to the requirements of this subpart in accordance with the requirements of either §§ 63.133 through 63.147, or § 63.102(b) of subpart F, or subpart D of this part if alternative emission limitations have been granted the transferor in accordance with those provisions. The certifying entity may revoke the written certification by sending a written statement to the EPA and the owner or operator giving at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions listed in this paragraph. Upon expiration of the notice period, the owner or operator may not transfer the wastewater stream or residual to the treatment operation.
              (3) By providing this written certification to the EPA, the certifying entity accepts responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section with respect to any shipment of wastewater or residual covered by the written certification. Failure to abide by any of those provisions with respect to such shipments may result in enforcement action by the EPA against the certifying entity in accordance with the enforcement provisions applicable to violations of these provisions by owners or operators of sources.
              (4) Written certifications and revocation statements, to the EPA from the transferees of wastewater or residuals shall be signed by the responsible official of the certifying entity, provide the name and address of the certifying entity, and be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional Office at the addresses listed in 40 CFR 63.13. Such written certifications are not transferable by the treater.

              § 63.138
              Process wastewater provisions—performance standards for treatment processes managing Group 1 wastewater streams and/or residuals removed from Group 1 wastewater streams.
              (a) General requirements. This section specifies the performance standards for treating Group 1 wastewater streams. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section. Where multiple compliance options are provided, the options may be used in combination for different wastewater streams and/or for different compounds (e.g., Table 8 versus Table 9 compounds) in the same wastewater streams, except where otherwise provided in this section. Once a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream has been treated in accordance with this subpart, it is no longer subject to the requirements of this subpart.
              (1) Existing source. If the wastewater stream, at an existing source, is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds, comply with § 63.138(b).
              (2) New source. If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 8 compounds, comply with § 63.138(c). If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds, comply with § 63.138(b). If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 8 and Table 9 compounds, comply with both § 63.138(b) and § 63.138(c).
              
              
                Note to paragraph (a)(2):
                The requirements for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds are similar and often identical.
              
              
              (3) Biological treatment processes. Biological treatment processes in compliance with this section may be either open or closed biological treatment processes as defined in § 63.111. An open biological treatment process in compliance with this section need not be covered and vented to a control device as required in § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart. An open or a closed biological treatment process in compliance with this section and using § 63.145(f) or § 63.145(g) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance is not subject to the requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart. A closed biological treatment process in compliance with this section and using § 63.145(e) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance shall comply with the requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart. Waste management units upstream of an open or closed biological treatment process shall meet the requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart, as applicable.
              (4) Performance tests and design evaluations. If design steam stripper option (§ 63.138(d)) or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) option (§ 63.138(h)) is selected to comply with this section, neither a design evaluation nor a performance test is required. For any other non-biological treatment process, and for closed biological treatment processes as defined in § 63.111 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in § 63.145, of this subpart. For each open biological treatment process as defined in § 63.111 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test as specified in § 63.145 of this subpart.
              
              
                Note to paragraph (a)(4):
                Some open biological treatment processes may not require a performance test. Refer to § 63.145(h) and table 36 of this subpart to determine whether the biological treatment process meets the criteria that exempt the owner or operator from conducting a performance test.
              
              
              (5) Control device requirements. When gases are vented from the treatment process, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable control device requirements specified in § 63.139 and § 63.145 (i) and (j), and the applicable leak inspection provisions specified in § 63.148, of this subpart. This requirement does not apply to any open biological treatment process that meets the mass removal requirements. Vents from anaerobic biological treatment processes may be routed through hard-piping to a fuel gas system.
              (6) Residuals: general. When residuals result from treating Group 1 wastewater streams, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements for residuals specified in § 63.138(k) of this subpart.
              (7) Treatment using a series of treatment processes. In all cases where the wastewater provisions in this subpart allow or require the use of a treatment process or control device to comply with emissions limitations, the owner or operator may use multiple treatment processes or control devices, respectively. For combinations of treatment processes where the wastewater stream is conveyed by hard-piping, the owner or operator shall comply with either the requirements of paragraph (a)(7)(i) or (a)(7)(ii) of this section. For combinations of treatment processes where the wastewater stream is not conveyed by hard-piping, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section. For combinations of control devices, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section.
              (i)(A) For combinations of treatment processes, the wastewater stream shall be conveyed by hard-piping between the treatment processes. For combinations of control devices, the vented gas stream shall be conveyed by hard-piping between the control devices.
              (B) For combinations of treatment processes, each treatment process shall meet the applicable requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              (C) The owner or operator shall identify, and keep a record of, the combination of treatment processes or of control devices, including identification of the first and last treatment process or control device. The owner or operator shall include this information as part of the treatment process description reported in the Notification of Compliance Status.
              (D) The performance test or design evaluation shall determine compliance across the combination of treatment processes or control devices. If a performance test is conducted, the “inlet” shall be the point at which the wastewater stream or residual enters the first treatment process, or the vented gas stream enters the first control device. The “outlet” shall be the point at which the treated wastewater stream exits the last treatment process, or the vented gas stream exits the last control device.
              (ii)(A) For combinations of treatment processes, each treatment process shall meet the applicable requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

              (B) The owner or operator shall identify, and keep a record of, the combination of treatment processes, including identification of the first and last treatment process. The owner or operator shall include this information as part of the treatment process description reported in the Notification of Compliance Status.
              (C) The owner or operator shall determine the mass removed or destroyed by each treatment process. The performance test or design evaluation shall determine compliance for the combination of treatment processes by adding together the mass removed or destroyed by each treatment process.
              (b) Control options: Group 1 wastewater streams for Table 9 compounds. The owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section for the control of Table 9 compounds at new or existing sources.
              (1) 50 ppmw concentration option. The owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Reduce, by removal or destruction, the total concentration of Table 9 compounds to a level less than 50 parts per million by weight as determined by the procedures specified in § 63.145(b) of this subpart.
              (ii) This option shall not be used when the treatment process is a biological treatment process. This option shall not be used when the wastewater stream is designated as a Group 1 wastewater stream as specified in § 63.132(e). Dilution shall not be used to achieve compliance with this option.
              (2) Other compliance options. Comply with the requirements specified in any one of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i) of this section.
              (c) Control options: Group 1 wastewater streams for Table 8 compounds. The owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section for the control of Table 8 compounds at new sources.

              (5) Maximum liquid loading of 67,100 liters per hour per square meter, and
              (6) Operate at nominal atmospheric pressure.
              (e) Percent mass removal/destruction option. The owner or operator of a new or existing source shall comply with paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section for control of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds for Group 1 wastewater streams. This option shall not be used for biological treatment processes.
              (1) Reduce mass flow rate of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds by 99 percent. For wastewater streams that are Group 1, the owner or operator shall reduce, by removal or destruction, the mass flow rate of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds by 99 percent or more. The removal/destruction efficiency shall be determined by the procedures specified in § 63.145(c), for noncombustion processes, or § 63.145(d), for combustion processes.
              (2) Reduce mass flow rate of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds by Fr value. For wastewater streams that are Group 1 for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds, the owner or operator shall reduce, by removal or destruction, the mass flow rate by at least the fraction removal (Fr) values specified in Table 9 of this subpart. (The Fr values for Table 8 compounds are all 0.99.) The removal/destruction efficiency shall be determined by the procedures specified in § 63.145(c), for noncombustion treatment processes, or § 63.145(d), for combustion treatment processes.
              (f) Required mass removal (RMR) option. The owner or operator shall achieve the required mass removal (RMR) of Table 8 compounds at a new source for a wastewater stream that is Group 1 for Table 8 compounds and/or of Table 9 compounds at a new or existing source for a wastewater stream that is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds. For nonbiological treatment processes compliance shall be determined using the procedures specified in § 63.145(e) of this subpart.

When complying with this paragraph, the term Group 1, whether used alone or in combination with other terms, in § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart shall mean both Group 1 and Group 2.
              (4) If a wastewater stream is in compliance with the requirements in paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1), (d), (e), (f), or (h) of this section before entering the biological treatment unit, the hazardous air pollutants mass of that wastewater is not required to be included in the total mass flow rate entering the biological treatment unit for the purpose of demonstrating compliance.
              (h) Treatment in a RCRA unit option. The owner or operator shall treat the wastewater stream or residual in a unit identified in, and complying with, paragraph (h)(1), (h)(2), or (h)(3) of this section. These units are exempt from the design evaluation or performance tests requirements specified in § 63.138(a)(3) and § 63.138(j) of this subpart, and from the monitoring requirements specified in § 63.132(a)(2)(iii) and § 63.132(b)(3)(iii) of this subpart, as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements associated with monitoring and performance tests.

              (1) The wastewater stream or residual is discharged to a hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O;
              (2) The wastewater stream or residual is discharged to a process heater or boiler burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator:
              (i) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or
              (ii) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.

The owner or operator shall comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart prior to the point where the wastewater enters the underground portion of the injection well.
              (i) One megagram total source mass flow rate option. A wastewater stream is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if the owner or operator elects to comply with either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section, and complies with paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
              (1) All Group 1 wastewater streams at the source. The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the total source mass flow rate for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds is less than 1 megagram per year using the procedures in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator shall include all Group 1 wastewater streams at the source in the total source mass flow rate. The total source mass flow rate shall be based on the mass as calculated before the wastewater stream is treated. The owner or operator who meets the requirements of this paragraph (i)(1) is exempt from the requirements of §§ 63.133 through 63.137.
              (i) Calculate the annual average mass flow rate for each Group 1 wastewater stream by multiplying the annual average flow rate of the wastewater stream, as determined by procedures specified in § 63.144(c), times the total annual average concentration of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds, as determined by procedures specified in § 63.144(b) of this subpart. (The mass flow rate of compounds in a wastewater stream that is Group 1 for both Table 8 and Table 9 compounds should be included in the annual average mass flow rate only once.)
              (ii) Calculate the total source mass flow rate from all Group 1 wastewater streams by adding together the annual average mass flow rate calculated for each Group 1 wastewater stream.
              (2) Untreated and partially treated Group 1 wastewater streams. The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the total source mass flow rate for untreated Group 1 wastewater streams and Group 1 wastewater streams treated to levels less stringent than required in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is less than 1 megagram per year using the procedures in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (i)(2)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator shall manage these wastewater streams in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, and shall comply with paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
              (i) Calculate the annual average mass flow rate in each wastewater stream by multiplying the annual average flow rate of the wastewater stream, as determined by procedures specified in § 63.144(c), times the total annual average concentration of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds, as determined by procedures specified in § 63.144(b). (The mass flow rate of compounds in a wastewater stream that are Group 1 for both Table 8 and Table 9 compounds should be included in the annual average mass flow rate only once.) When determining the total source mass flow rate for the purposes of paragraph (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the concentration and flow rate shall be determined at the location specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section and not at the location specified in § 63.144(b) and (c).
              (A) For each untreated Group 1 wastewater stream, the annual average flow rate and the total annual average concentration shall be determined for that stream's point of determination.

              (B) For each Group 1 wastewater stream that is treated to levels less stringent than those required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the annual average flow rate and total annual average concentration shall be determined at the discharge from the treatment process or series of treatment processes.
              (C) The annual average mass flow rate for Group 1 wastewater streams treated to the levels required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is not included in the calculation of the total source mass flow rate.
              (ii) The total source mass flow rate shall be calculated by summing the annual average mass flow rates from all Group 1 wastewater streams, except those excluded by paragraph (i)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
              (iii) The owner or operator of each waste management unit that receives, manages, or treats a partially treated wastewater stream prior to or during treatment shall comply with the requirements of §§ 63.133 through 63.137, as applicable. For a partially treated wastewater stream that is stored, conveyed, treated, or managed in a waste management unit meeting the requirements of §§ 63.133 through 63.137, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section to calculate mass flow rate. A wastewater stream, either untreated or partially treated, where the mass flow rate has been calculated following the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section, is exempt from the requirements of §§ 63.133 through 63.137.
              (3) Wastewater streams included in this option shall be identified in the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.152(b).
              (j) Design evaluations or performance tests for treatment processes. Except as provided in paragraph (j)(3) or (h) of this section, the owner or operator shall demonstrate by the procedures in either paragraph (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section that each nonbiological treatment process used to comply with paragraphs (b)(1), (c)(1), (e), and/or (f) of this section achieves the conditions specified for compliance. The owner or operator shall demonstrate by the procedures in either paragraph (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section that each closed biological treatment process used to comply with paragraphs (f) or (g) of this section achieves the conditions specified for compliance. If an open biological treatment unit is used to comply with paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with § 63.145(f) or § 63.145(g), respectively, of this subpart. Some biological treatment processes may not require a performance test. Refer to § 63.145(h) and table 36 of this subpart to determine whether the open biological treatment process meets the criteria that exempt the owner or operator from conducting a performance test.
              (1) A design evaluation and supporting documentation that addresses the operating characteristics of the treatment process and that is based on operation at a representative wastewater stream flow rate and a concentration under which it would be most difficult to demonstrate compliance. For closed biological treatment processes, the actual mass removal shall be determined by a mass balance over the unit. The mass flow rate of Table 8 or Table 9 compounds exiting the treatment process shall be the sum of the mass flow rate of Table 8 or Table 9 compounds in the wastewater stream exiting the biological treatment process and the mass flow rate of the vented gas stream exiting the control device. The mass flow rate entering the treatment process minus the mass flow rate exiting the process determines the actual mass removal.
              (2) Performance tests conducted using test methods and procedures that meet the applicable requirements specified in § 63.145 of this subpart.
              (3) The provisions of paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(2) of this section do not apply to design stream strippers which meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
              (k) Residuals. For each residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream, the owner or operator shall control for air emissions by complying with §§ 63.133-137 of this subpart and by complying with one of the provisions in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section.

              (1) Recycle the residual to a production process or sell the residual for the purpose of recycling. Once a residual is returned to a production process, the residual is no longer subject to this section.
              (2) Return the residual to the treatment process.
              (3) Treat the residual to destroy the total combined mass flow rate of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds by 99 percent or more, as determined by the procedures specified in § 63.145(c) or (d) of this subpart.

              § 63.144
              Process wastewater provisions—test methods and procedures for determining applicability and Group 1/Group 2 determinations (determining which wastewater streams require control).
              (a) Procedures to determine applicability. An owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section for each wastewater stream to determine which wastewater streams require control for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds. The owner or operator may use a combination of the approaches in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for different wastewater streams generated at the source.
              (1) Determine Group 1 or Group 2 status. Determine whether a wastewater stream is a Group 1 or Group 2 wastewater stream in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (2) Designate as Group 1. An owner or operator may designate as a Group 1 wastewater stream a single wastewater stream or a mixture of wastewater streams. The owner or operator is not required to determine the concentration or flow rate for each designated Group 1 wastewater stream for the purposes of this section.
              (b) Procedures to establish concentrations, when determining Group status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the annual average concentration for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for existing sources or paragraph (b)(2) of this section for new sources. The annual average concentration shall be a flow weighted average representative of actual or anticipated operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit generating the wastewater over a designated 12 month period. For flexible operation units, the owner or operator shall consider the anticipated production over the designated 12 month period and include all wastewater streams generated by the process equipment during this period. The owner/operator is not required to determine the concentration of Table 8 or Table 9 compounds that are not reasonably expected to be in the process.
              (1) Existing sources. An owner or operator of an existing source who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds. For the purposes of this section, the term concentration, whether concentration is used alone or with other terms, may be adjusted by multiplying by the compound-specific fraction measured (Fm) factors listed in table 34 of this subpart unless determined by the methods in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A) and/or (B). When concentration is determined by Method 305 as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(B), concentration may be adjusted by dividing by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. When concentration is determined by Method 25D as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A), concentration may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. Compound-specific Fm factors may be used only when concentrations of individual compounds are determined or when only one compound is in the wastewater stream. Flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds means the total mass of Table 9 compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. The total annual average concentration shall be determined for each wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the annual average concentration. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.
              (2) New sources. An owner or operator of a new source who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine both the flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds and the flow weighted annual average concentration for each Table 8 compound. For the purposes of this section, the term concentration, whether concentration is used alone or with other terms, may be adjusted by multiplying by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart unless determined by the methods in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A) and/or (B). When concentration is determined by Method 305 as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(B), concentration may be adjusted by dividing by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. When concentration is determined by Method 25D as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A), concentration may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. Compound-specific fraction measured factors are compound specific and shall be used only when concentration of individual compounds are determined or when only one compound is in the wastewater stream. The flow weighted annual average concentration of each Table 8 compound means the mass of each Table 8 compound occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. Flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds means the total mass of Table 9 compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. The annual average concentration shall be determined for each wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the annual average concentration. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.
              (3) Knowledge of the wastewater. Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the annual average concentration for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average concentration is not required for Group 1 streams. Examples of acceptable documentation include material balances, records of chemical purchases, process stoichiometry, or previous test results. If test data are used, the owner or operator shall provide documentation describing the testing protocol and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination.
              (4) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data. Where bench-scale or pilot-scale test data are used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document that the data are representative of the actual annual average concentration, or are reliably indicative of another relevant characteristic of the wastewater stream that could be used to predict the annual average concentration. For concentration data, the owner or operator shall also provide documentation describing the testing protocol, and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination of annual average concentration.
              (5) Test data from sampling at the point of determination or at a location downstream of the point of determination. Where an owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section by measuring the concentration for the relevant Table 8 or Table 9 compounds, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. For each wastewater stream, measurements shall be made either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A minimum of three samples from each wastewater stream shall be taken. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples.
              (i) Methods. The owner or operator shall use any of the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (b)(5)(i)(F) of this section.
              (A) Method 25D. Use procedures specified in Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (B) Method 305. Use procedures specified in Method 305 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.
              (C) Methods 624 and 625. Use procedures specified in Methods 624 and 625 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A and comply with the sampling protocol requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If these methods are used to analyze one or more compounds that are not on the method's published list of approved compounds, the Alternative Test Procedure specified in 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5 shall be followed. For Method 625, make corrections to the compounds for which the analysis is being conducted based on the accuracy as recovery factors in Table 7 of the method.
              (D) Method 1624 and Method 1625. Use procedures specified in Method 1624 and Method 1625 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A and comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If these methods are used to analyze one or more compounds that are not on the method's published list of approved compounds, the Alternative Test Procedure specified in 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5 shall be followed.
              (E) Other EPA method(s). Use procedures specified in the method and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and either paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section.
              (F) Method(s) other than EPA method. Use procedures specified in the method and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.
              (G) Method 8260B. Use procedures specified in Method 8260B in the SW-846 Compendium of Methods.
              (H) Method 316. Use Method 316 to determine formaldehyde concentration.
              (ii) Sampling plan. The owner or operator who is expressly referred to this paragraph by provisions of this subpart shall prepare a sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant hazardous air pollutants listed in table 8 or table 9 of this subpart. An example of an acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The sampling plan shall be maintained at the facility.
              (iii) Validation of methods. The owner or operator shall validate EPA methods other than Methods 25D, 305, 624, 625, 1624, and 1625 using the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The owner or operator shall validate other methods as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.
              (A) Validation of EPA methods and other methods. The method used to measure organic hazardous air pollutants concentrations in the wastewater shall be validated according to section 5.1 or 5.3, and the corresponding calculations in section 6.1 or 6.3, of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. The data are acceptable if they meet the criteria specified in section 6.1.5 or 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. If correction is required under section 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part, the data are acceptable if the correction factor is within the range 0.7 to 1.30. Other sections of Method 301 of appendix A of this part are not required. The concentrations of the individual organic hazardous air pollutants measured in the water may be corrected to their concentrations had they been measured by Method 305 of appendix A of this part, by multiplying each concentration by the compound-specific fraction measured (Fm) factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.
              (B) Validation for EPA methods. Follow the procedures as specified in “Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA Waste Methods” 40 CFR part 63, appendix D.
              (iv) Calculations of average concentration. The average concentration for each individually speciated Table 8 compound shall be calculated by adding the individual values determined for the specific compound in each sample and dividing by the number of samples. The total average concentration of Table 9 compounds shall be calculated by first summing the concentration of the individual compounds to obtain a total hazardous air pollutants concentration for the sample; add the sample totals and then divide by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run. If the method used does not speciate the compounds, the sample results should be added and this total divided by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run.
              (6) Adjustment for concentrations determined downstream of the point of determination. The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average concentration or total annual average concentration when the concentration is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where: two or more wastewater streams have been mixed; one or more wastewater streams have been treated; or, losses to the atmosphere have occurred. The owner or operator shall make the adjustments either to the individual data points or to the final annual average concentration.
              (c) Procedures to determine flow rate, when evaluating Group status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An owner or operator who elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the annual average flow rate of the wastewater stream either at the point of determination for each wastewater stream, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. These procedures may be used in combination for different wastewater streams at the source. The annual average flow rate for the wastewater stream shall be representative of actual or anticipated operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit generating the wastewater over a designated 12-month period. The owner or operator shall consider the total annual wastewater volume generated by the chemical manufacturing process unit. If the chemical manufacturing process unit is a flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall consider all anticipated production in the process equipment over the designated 12-month period. The procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the flow rate. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.
              (1) Knowledge of the wastewater. The owner or operator may use knowledge of the wastewater stream and/or the process to determine the annual average flow rate. The owner or operator shall use the maximum expected annual average production capacity of the process unit, knowledge of the process, and/or mass balance information to either: Estimate directly the annual average wastewater flow rate; or estimate the total annual wastewater volume and then divide total volume by 525,600 minutes in a year. Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
              (2) Historical records. The owner or operator may use historical records to determine the annual average flow rate. Derive the highest annual average flow rate of wastewater from historical records representing the most recent 5 years of operation or, if the process unit has been in service for less than 5 years but at least 1 year, from historical records representing the total operating life of the process unit. Where historical records are used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
              (3) Measurements of flow rate. Where an owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section by measuring the flow rate, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Measurements shall be made at the point of determination, or at a location downstream of the point of determination with adjustments for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Where measurement data are used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
              (4) Adjustment for flow rates determined downstream of the point of determination. The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average flow rate of a wastewater stream when it is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where two or more wastewater streams have been mixed or one or more wastewater streams have been treated. The owner or operator shall make corrections for such changes in the annual average flow rate.

              § 63.145
              Process wastewater provisions—test methods and procedures to determine compliance.
              (a) General. This section specifies the procedures for performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a treatment process or a control device with the control requirements specified in § 63.138 of this subpart. Owners or operators conducting a design evaluation shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. Owners or operators conducting a performance test shall comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section.
              (1) Performance tests and design evaluations for treatment processes. If design steam stripper option (§ 63.138(d)) or RCRA option (§ 63.138(h)) is selected to comply with § 63.138, neither a design evaluation nor a performance test is required. For any other non-biological treatment process, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in this section. For closed biological treatment processes, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in this section. For each open biological treatment process, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test as specified in this section.
              
              
                Note:
                Some open biological treatment processes may not require a performance test. Refer to § 63.145(h) and table 36 of this subpart to determine whether the biological treatment process meets the criteria that exempt the owner or operator from conducting a performance test.
              
              
              (2) Performance tests and design evaluations for control devices. The owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.139(d), or a performance test as specified in paragraph (i) of this section for control devices other than flares and paragraph (j) of this section for flares.
              (3) Representative process unit operating conditions. Compliance shall be demonstrated for representative operating conditions. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction and periods of nonoperation shall not constitute representative conditions. The owner or operator shall record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test.
              (4) Representative treatment process or control device operating conditions. Performance tests shall be conducted when the treatment process or control device is operating at a representative inlet flow rate and concentration. If the treatment process or control device will be operating at several different sets of representative operating conditions, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator shall record information that is necessary to document treatment process or control device operating conditions during the test.
              (i) Range of operating conditions. If the treatment process or control device will be operated at several different sets of representative operating conditions, performance testing over the entire range is not required. In such cases, the performance test results shall be supplemented with modeling and/or engineering assessments to demonstrate performance over the operating range.
              (ii) Consideration of residence time. If concentration and/or flow rate to the treatment process or control device are not relatively constant (i.e., comparison of inlet and outlet data will not be representative of performance), the owner or operator shall consider residence time, when determining concentration and flow rate.
              
              (5) Testing equipment. All testing equipment shall be prepared and installed as specified in the applicable test methods, or as approved by the Administrator.
              (6) Compounds not required to be considered in performance tests or design evaluations. Compounds that meet the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), or (a)(6)(iii) of this section are not required to be included in the performance test. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 shall not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.
              (i) Compounds not used or produced by the chemical manufacturing process unit; or
              (ii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below 1 part per million by weight; or
              (iii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below the lower detection limit where the lower detection limit is greater than 1 part per million by weight. The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has that compound as a target analyte.
              (7) Treatment using a series of treatment processes. In all cases where the wastewater provisions in this subpart allow or require the use of a treatment process to comply with emissions limitations, the owner or operator may use multiple treatment processes. The owner or operator complying with the requirements of § 63.138(a)(7)(i), when wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping, shall comply with either §§ 63.145(a)(7)(i) or 63.145(a)(7)(ii) of this subpart. The owner or operator complying with the requirements of § 63.138(a)(7)(ii) of this subpart shall comply with the requirements of § 63.145(a)(7)(ii) of this subpart.
              (i) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across each series of treatment processes. For each series of treatment processes, inlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured either where the wastewater stream enters the first treatment process in a series of treatment processes, or prior to the first treatment process as specified in § 63.145(a)(9) of this subpart. For each series of treatment processes, outlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured where the wastewater stream exits the last treatment process in the series of treatment processes, except when the last treatment process is an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by using the procedures in § 63.145 (f) or (g) of this subpart. When the last treatment process is either an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by using the procedures in § 63.145 (f) or (g) of this subpart, inlet and outlet concentrations and flow rates shall be measured as provided in paragraphs (a)(7)(i)(A) and (a)(7)(i)(B) of this section. The mass flow rates removed or destroyed by the series of treatment processes and by the biological treatment process are all used to calculate actual mass removal (AMR) as specified in § 63.145(f)(5)(ii) of this subpart.
              (A) The inlet and outlet to the series of treatment processes prior to the biological treatment process are the points at which the wastewater enters the first treatment process and exits the last treatment process in the series, respectively, except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (B) The inlet to the biological treatment process shall be the point at which the wastewater enters the biological treatment process or the outlet from the series of treatment processes identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.

              (ii) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across each treatment process in the series of treatment processes. The mass flow rate removed or destroyed by each treatment process shall be added together to determine whether compliance has been demonstrated using § 63.145 (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g), as applicable. If a biological treatment process is one of the treatment processes in the series of treatment processes, the inlet to the biological treatment process shall be the point at which the wastewater enters the biological treatment process, or the inlet to the equalization tank if all the criteria of paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section are met.
              (8) When using a biological treatment process to comply with § 63.138 of this subpart, the owner or operator may elect to calculate the AMR using a subset of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds determined at the point of determination or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration and flowrate changes made according to § 63.144(b)(6) and § 63.144(c)(4) of this subpart, respectively. All Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds measured to determine the RMR, except as provided by § 63.145(a)(6), shall be included in the RMR calculation.
              (9) The owner or operator determining the inlet for purposes of demonstrating compliance with § 63.145 (e), (f), or (g) of this subpart may elect to comply with paragraph (a)(9)(i) or (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
              (i) When wastewater is conveyed exclusively by hard-piping from the point of determination to a treatment process that is either the only treatment process or the first in a series of treatment processes (i.e., no treatment processes or other waste management units are used upstream of this treatment process to store, handle, or convey the wastewater), the inlet to the treatment process shall be at any location from the point of determination to where the wastewater stream enters the treatment process. When samples are taken upstream of the treatment process and before wastewater streams have converged, the owner or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138 (e) or (f) to comply and that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 and Group 2 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138(g) to comply, except as provided in § 63.145(a)(6).
              (ii) The owner or operator may consider the inlet to the equalization tank as the inlet to the biological treatment process if all the criteria in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(A) through (a)(9)(ii)(C) of this section are met. The outlet from the series of treatment processes prior to the biological treatment process is the point at which the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the series prior to the equalization tank, if the equalization tank and biological treatment process are part of a series of treatment processes. The owner or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138 (e) or (f) to comply and that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 and Group 2 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138(g) to comply, except as provided in § 63.145(a)(6).
              (A) The wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping from either the last previous treatment process or the point of determination to the equalization tank.
              (B) The wastewater is conveyed from the equalization tank exclusively by hard-piping to the biological treatment process and no treatment processes or other waste management units are used to store, handle, or convey the wastewater between the equalization tank and the biological treatment process.
              (C) The equalization tank is equipped with a fixed roof and a closed vent system that routes emissions to a control device that meets the requirements of § 63.133(a)(2)(i) and § 63.133 (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this subpart.
              (b) Noncombustion treatment process—concentration limits. This paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a noncombustion treatment process with the parts per million by weight wastewater stream concentration limits at the outlet of the treatment process. This compliance option is specified in § 63.138(b)(1) and § 63.138(c)(1). Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity per § 63.144(b)(5)(ii). Samples shall be collected and analyzed using the procedures specified in § 63.144 (b)(5)(i), (b)(5)(ii), and (b)(5)(iii) of this subpart. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 may be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 may be adjusted by multiplying each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. (For wastewater streams that are Group 1 for both Table 8 and Table 9 compounds, compliance is demonstrated only if the sum of the concentrations of Table 9 compounds is less than 50 ppmw, and the concentration of each Table 8 compound is less than 10 ppmw.)
              (c) Noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process: Percent mass removal/destruction option. This paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process with the percent mass removal limits specified in § 63.138(e) (1) and (2) for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements specified in § 63.145 (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this subpart.
              (1) Concentration. The concentration of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds entering and exiting the treatment process shall be determined as provided in this paragraph. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity per § 63.144(b)(5)(ii). The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has that compound as a target analyte. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 shall not adjust by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 34 of this subpart.
              (2) Flow rate. The flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater streams shall be determined using inlet and outlet flow measurement devices, respectively. Where the outlet flow is not greater than the inlet flow, a flow measurement device shall be used, and may be used at either the inlet or outlet. Flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the concentration measurements.
              (3) Calculation of mass flow rate—for noncombustion, nonbiological treatment processes. The mass flow rates of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds entering and exiting the treatment process are calculated as follows.

Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 of appendix A of this part shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 shall not adjust by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.
              (2) Flow rate of wastewater entering the combustion treatment process.

              (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the process fluid not each individual volatile organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, the average stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis.
              (ii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

              (5) An owner or operator may elect to adjust or not adjust instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall measure background concentration using the procedures in §§ 63.180(b) and (c) of subpart H of this part. The owner or operator shall subtract background reading from the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument.

              (2) Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (3) For leaks found in vapor collection systems used for transfer operations, repairs shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected or at the beginning of the next transfer loading operation, whichever is later.
              (e) Delay of repair of a vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, as defined in § 63.101 of subpart F of this part, or if the owner or operator determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment shall be complete by the end of the next shutdown.
              (f) For each vapor collection system or closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of either paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
              (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that determines whether vent stream flow is present at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.118(a)(3) of this subpart. The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line; or
              (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
              (3) Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph.
              (g) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, as unsafe to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)(i) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator determines that the equipment is unsafe to inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(i) of this section; and
              (2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-inspect times.
              (h) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, as difficult to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)(i) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator determines that the equipment cannot be inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface; and
              (2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.
              (i) The owner or operator shall record the information specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(5) of this section.

              (3) For each vapor collection system or closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall keep a record of the information specified in either paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (i)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under paragraph (f)(1) of this section was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating.
              (ii) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or operator shall record whether the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and shall record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.
              (4) For each inspection during which a leak is detected, a record of the information specified in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (i)(4)(viii) of this section.

              Control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems within a chemical manufacturing process unit.
              (a) The owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of table 35 of this subpart, for each item of equipment meeting all the criteria specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) and either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.

              (b) The item of equipment is of a type identified in table 35 of this subpart;
              
              (c) The item of equipment is part of a chemical manufacturing process unit that meets the criteria of § 63.100(b) of subpart F of this part;
              (d) The item of equipment is controlled less stringently than in table 35 and is not listed in § 63.100(f) of subpart F of this part, and the item of equipment is not otherwise exempt from controls by the provisions of subparts A, F, G, or H of this part; and
              (e) The item of equipment:
              (1) is a drain, drain hub, manhole, lift station, trench, pipe, or oil/water separator that conveys water with a total annual average concentration greater than or equal to 10,000 parts per million by weight of Table 9 compounds at any flowrate; or a total annual average concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 parts per million by weight of Table 9 compounds at an annual average flow rate greater than or equal to 10 liters per minute. At a chemical manufacturing process unit subject to the new source requirements of 40 CFR 63.100(l)(1) or 40 CFR 63.100(l)(2), the criteria of this paragraph are also met if the item of equipment conveys water with an annual average concentration greater than or equal to 10 parts per million by weight of any Table 8 compound at an annual average flow rate greater than or equal to 0.02 liter per minute, or

At a chemical manufacturing process unit subject to the new source requirements of 40 CFR 63.100(l)(1) or 40 CFR 63.100 (l)(2), the criteria of this paragraph are also met if the tank receives one or more streams that contain water with an annual average concentration greater than or equal to 10 parts per million by weight of any Table 8 compound at an annual average flow rate greater than or equal to 0.02 liter per minute. The owner or operator of the source shall determine the characteristics of the stream as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) The characteristics of the stream being received shall be determined at the inlet to the tank.
              (ii) The characteristics shall be determined according to the procedures in § 63.144 (b) and (c).

              § 63.150
              Emissions averaging provisions.
              (a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.112(a) of this subpart by using emissions averaging according to § 63.112(f) of this subpart rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the definition of process vent in § 63.101 and the sampling site designation in § 63.115(a), for purposes of this section the location of a process vent shall be defined, and the characteristics of its gas stream shall be determined, consistent with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
              (b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.151(d) of this subpart for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan or operating permit application shall identify all emission points to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.111 of this subpart) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average.
              (c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits, if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point:
              (1) Group 2 emission points.

              (2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percent reductions for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead.
              (d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:
              (1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990, unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.
              (2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology, unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting the specifications of § 63.119(b) of this subpart applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control.
              (3) Emission points on shut-down process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits.
              (4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.
              (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.
              (e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall:
              (1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.
              (2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.
              (3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.

              (i) The owner or operator may choose to include more than the required number of credit-generating emission points in an average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.
              
              (ii) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan or operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations.
              (4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
              (5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.152(c) of this subpart. Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.152(c)(5)(iv)(B) of this subpart.
              (f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following:
              (1) More than 20 individual Group 1 or Group 2 emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points.
              (2) Periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction as described in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by § 63.6(e)(3) of subpart A of this part.
              (3) Periods of monitoring excursions as defined in § 63.152(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this subpart. For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
              (i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.
              (ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.
              (iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section.
              (g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for the Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:
              (1) The overall equation for calculating source-wide debits is:
              
                ER22AP94.245
              
              
                where:
                

                Debits and all terms of the equation are in units of megagrams per month, and
                
                EPViACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 process vent i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
                (0.02) EPViu = Emissions from each Group 1 vent i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions, calculated according to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
                ESiACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 storage vessel i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
                (0.05) ESiu = Emissions from each Group 1 storage vessel i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions, calculated according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
                ETRiACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 transfer rack i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
                (0.02) ETRiu = Emissions from each Group 1 transfer rack i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions, calculated according to paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
                EWWiACTUAL = Emissions from each Group 1 wastewater stream i that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
                EWWic = Emissions from each Group 1 wastewater stream i if the reference control technology had been applied to the uncontrolled emissions. This is calculated according to paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
                n = The number of emission points being included in the emissions average. The value of n is not necessarily the same for process vents, storage vessels, transfer racks, and wastewater.
              
              
              (2) Emissions from process vents shall be calculated according to paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) The location of a process vent shall be defined, and the characteristics of its gas stream shall be determined at a point that meets the conditions in either paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section and the conditions in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(C) through (E) of this section.
              (A) The point is after the final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present).
              (B) If a gas stream included in an emissions average is combined with one or more other gas streams after a final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present), then for each gas stream, the point is at a representative point after any final recovery device and as near as feasible to, but before, the point of combination of the gas streams.
              (C) The point is before any control device (for process vents, recovery devices shall not be considered control devices).
              (D) The point is before discharge to the atmosphere.
              (E) The measurement site for determination of the characteristics of the gas stream was selected using Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

              (ii) The following equation shall be used for each process vent i to calculate EPViu:
              
                ER22AP94.246
              
              
                where:
                
                EPViu = Uncontrolled process vent emission rate from process vent i, megagrams per month.
                Q = Vent stream flow rate, dry standard cubic meters per minute, measured using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of part 60, appendix A, as appropriate.
                h = Monthly hours of operation during which positive flow is present in the vent, hours per month.
                Cj = Concentration, parts per million by volume, dry basis, of organic HAP j as measured by Method 18 of part 60, appendix A.
                Mj = Molecular weight of organic HAP j, gram per gram-mole.
                n = Number of organic HAP's.
              
              
              (A) The values of Q, Cj, and Mj shall be determined during a performance test conducted under representative operating conditions. The values of Q, Cj, and Mj shall be established in the Notification of Compliance Status and must be updated as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

              (B) If there is a change in capacity utilization other than a change in monthly operating hours, or if any other change is made to the process or product recovery equipment or operation such that the previously measured values of Q, Cj, and Mj are no longer representative, a new performance test shall be conducted to determine new representative values of Q, Cj, and Mj. These new values shall be used to calculate debits and credits from the time of the change forward, and the new values shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.

              (iii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to calculate EPViACTUAL:

              (A) If the vent is not controlled by a control device or pollution prevention measure, EPViACTUAL = EPViu, where EPViu is calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (B) If the vent is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 98-percent reduction,
              
                ER22AP94.247
              
              (1) The percent reduction shall be measured according to the procedures in § 63.116 of this subpart if a combustion control device is used. For a flare meeting the criteria in § 63.116(a) of this subpart, or a boiler or process heater meeting the criteria in § 63.116(b) of this subpart, the percent reduction shall be 98 percent. If a non-combustion control device is used, percent reduction shall be demonstrated by a performance test at the inlet and outlet of the device, or, if testing is not feasible, by a control design evaluation and documented engineering calculations.
              (2) For determining debits from Group 1 process vents, recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and cannot be assigned a percent reduction in calculating EPViACTUAL. The sampling site for measurement of uncontrolled emissions is after the final recovery device. However, as provided in § 63.113(a)(3), a Group 1 process vent may add sufficient recovery to raise the TRE index value above 1.0, thereby becoming a Group 2 process vent.
              (3) Procedures for calculating the percent reduction of pollution prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (3) Emissions from storage vessels shall be calculated as follows:

              (i) The following equation shall be used for each storage vessel i to calculate ESiu:
              
                ER22AP94.248
              
              
                where:
                
                ESiu = Uncontrolled emissions, defined as emissions from a fixed roof vessel having identical dimensions and vessel color as vessel i, megagrams per month.
                LB = Breathing loss emissions, megagrams per year, calculated according to paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
                LW = Working loss emissions, megagrams per year, calculated according to paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
                12 = Constant, months per year.
              
              
              (A) Breathing loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER22AP94.249
              
              
                where:
                
                Mv = Molecular weight of vapor in storage vessel, pound per pound-mole.

              (6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines the control technology is not different in use or design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny the application.
              (j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures:
              (1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice which meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions, while the same product is produced.
              (ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: substitution of feedstocks that reduce HAP emissions; alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.
              (2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990, can be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. When the term “organic HAP” is used in § 63.150(j)(2) in reference to wastewater emission points, the term “table 9 HAP” shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph.

              (i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(5) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section is the percent difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.
              (ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.
              
                ER22AP94.290
              
              
                where:
                
                Percent reduction = Efficiency of pollution prevention measure (percent organic HAP reduction).
                EB = Monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A), (j)(2)(ii)(B), and (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
                Epp = Monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) or (j)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.
                PB = Monthly production before the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, during the same period over which EB is calculated.
                Ppp = Monthly production after the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month.
              
              

              (A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, EB, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the equations and procedures in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of this section for process vents, storage vessels, and transfer operations.
              (B) For wastewater, EB shall be calculated as follows:
              
                ER26AP99.011
              
              
                Where:
                
                n = Number of wastewater streams.
                QBi = Average flow rate for wastewater stream i before the pollution prevention measure, defined and determined according to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, liters per minute, before implementation of the pollution prevention measure.
                HBi = Number of hours per month that wastewater stream i was discharged before the pollution prevention measure, hours per month.
                s = Total number of table 9 HAP in wastewater stream i.
                Fem = Fraction emitted of table 9 HAP m in wastewater of this subpart, dimensionless.
                HAPBim = Average concentration of table 9 HAP m in wastewater stream i, defined and determined according to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, before the pollution prevention measure, parts per million by weight, as measured before the implementation of the pollution measure.
              
              

              (C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to April 22, 1994, records may be used to determine EB.

              (D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, Epp, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.
              (E) For wastewater, Epp shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER22AP94.292
              
              
                
                where n, Qppi, Hppi, s, Fem, and HAPppim are defined and determined as described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section except that Qppi, Hppi, and HAPppim shall be determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.
              
              
              (iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.
              (iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in emissions for each emission point must be calculated.
              (v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section, used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of a source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
              (k) The owner or operator must demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the average will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the operating permit authority, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.113 through 63.148.
              (1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made to the satisfaction of the operating permit authority.
              (i) The Administrator may require owners and operators to use specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk determination.
              (ii) The demonstration and approval of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made according to any guidance that the Administrator makes available for use.
              (2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their operating permit application or in their Implementation Plan if an operating permit application has not yet been submitted.
              (3) An emissions averaging plan that does not demonstrate hazard or risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the emissions averaging plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart.
              (4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration must:
              (i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
              (ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and
              (iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such demonstrations.
              (l) For periods of excursions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.152 of this subpart.
              (2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures of demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.

              (3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the excursion and the other type of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.
              
              (4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.
              (m) For each Group 1 or Group 2 emission point included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting equivalent to that required for Group 1 emission points complying with §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart.

Changes to these parameters must be reported as required by paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (iii) The estimated percent reduction if a control technology achieving a lower percent reduction than the efficiency of the reference control technology, as defined in § 63.111 of this subpart, is or will be applied to the emission point.
              (iv) The anticipated nominal efficiency if a control technology achieving a greater percent emission reduction than the efficiency of the reference control technology is or will be applied to the emission point. The procedures in § 63.150(i) of this subpart shall be followed to apply for a nominal efficiency.

              (ii) Each storage vessel controlled by pollution prevention or a control technique other than an internal or external floating roof or a closed vent system with a control device.
              (8) Documentation of the information listed in paragraph (d)(8)(i) through (d)(8)(iv) for each process wastewater stream included in the average.
              (i) The information used to determine whether the wastewater stream is a Group 1 or Group 2 wastewater stream.
              (ii) The estimated values of all parameters needed for input to the wastewater emission credit and debit calculations in § 63.150 (g)(5) and (h)(5) of this subpart.
              (iii) The estimated percent reduction if:
              (A) A control technology that achieves an emission reduction less than or equal to the emission reduction achieved by the design steam stripper, as specified in § 63.138(g) of this subpart, is or will be applied to the wastewater stream, or
              (B) A control technology achieving less than or equal to 95 percent emission reduction is or will be applied to the vapor stream(s) vented and collected from the treatment processes, or
              (C) A pollution prevention measure is or will be applied.

              (1) The owner or operator who plans to make a change listed in paragraph (i)(1)(i) or (i)(1)(ii) of this section shall submit an Implementation Plan update at least 120 calendar days prior to making the change.
              (i) Whenever an owner or operator elects to achieve compliance with the emissions averaging provisions in § 63.150 of this subpart by using a control technique other than that specified in the Implementation Plan or plans to monitor a different parameter or operate a control device in a manner other than that specified in the Implementation Plan.
              (ii) Whenever an emission point or a chemical manufacturing process unit is added to an existing source and is planned to be included in an emissions average, or whenever an emission point not included in the emissions average described in the Implementation Plan is to be added to an emissions average. The information in paragraph (d) of this section shall be updated to include the additional emission point.
              (2) The owner or operator who has made a change listed in paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) of this section shall submit an Implementation Plan update within 90 calendar days after the information regarding the change is known to the source. The update may be submitted in the next quarterly Periodic Report if the change is made after the date the Notification of Compliance status is due.
              (i) Whenever a process change is made such that the group status of any emission point in an emissions average changes.
              (ii) Whenever a value of a parameter in the emission credit or debit equations in § 63.150(g) or (h) changes such that it is outside the range specified in the Implementation Plan and causes a decrease in the projected credits or an increase in the projected debits.
              (3) The Administrator shall approve or request changes to the Implementation Plan update within 120 calendar days of receipt of sufficient information regarding the change for emission points included in emissions averages.
              (j) The owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart, for emission points that are not included in an emissions average, shall report to the Administrator under the circumstances described in paragraphs (j)(1), (j)(2), and (j)(3) of this section unless the relevant information has been included and submitted in an operating permit application or amendment, or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority. The information shall be submitted within 180 calendar days after the change is made or the information regarding the change is known to the source. The update may be submitted in the next Periodic Report if the change is made after the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
              (1) Whenever a deliberate change is made such that the group status of any emission point changes. The information submitted shall include a compliance schedule as specified in § 63.100 of subpart F of this part if the emission point becomes Group 1.
              (2) Whenever an owner or operator elects to achieve compliance with this subpart by using a control technique other than that previously reported to the Administrator or to the permitting authority, or plans to monitor a different parameter, or operate a control device in a manner other than that previously reported.

              (4) Periodic Reports described in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (5) Other reports described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
              (b) Each owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall submit a Notification of Compliance Status within 150 calendar days after the compliance dates specified in § 63.100 of subpart F of this part.
              (1) The notification shall include the results of any emission point group determinations, performance tests, inspections, continuous monitoring system performance evaluations, values of monitored parameters established during performance tests, and any other information used to demonstrate compliance or required to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status under § 63.110 (h) for regulatory overlaps, under § 63.117 for process vents, § 63.122 for storage vessels, § 63.129 for transfer operations, § 63.146 for process wastewater, and § 63.150 for emission points included in an emissions average.
              (i) For performance tests and group determinations that are based on measurements, the Notification of Compliance Status shall include one complete test report for each test method used for a particular kind of emission point. For additional tests performed for the same kind of emission point using the same method, the results and any other information required in § 63.117 for process vents, § 63.129 for transfer, and § 63.146 for process wastewater shall be submitted, but a complete test report is not required.
              (ii) A complete test report shall include a brief process description, sampling site description, description of sampling and analysis procedures and any modifications to standard procedures, quality assurance procedures, record of operating conditions during the test, record of preparation of standards, record of calibrations, raw data sheets for field sampling, raw data sheets for field and laboratory analyses, documentation of calculations, and any other information required by the test method.
              (2) For each monitored parameter for which a range is required to be established under § 63.114 for process vents, § 63.127 for transfer, § 63.143 for process wastewater, § 63.150(m) for emission points in emissions averages, or § 63.151(f), or § 63.152(e), the Notification of Compliance Status shall include the information in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, unless the range and the operating day definition have been established in the operating permit. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to storage vessels are located in §§ 63.122 and 63.123.
              (i) The specific range of the monitored parameter(s) for each emission point;
              (ii) The rationale for the specific range for each parameter for each emission point, including any data and calculations used to develop the range and a description of why the range indicates proper operation of the control device.
              (A) If a performance test is required by this subpart for a control device, the range shall be based on the parameter values measured during the performance test and may be supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of permitted parameter values.
              (B) If a performance test is not required by this subpart for a control device, the range may be based solely on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.
              (iii) A definition of the source's operating day for purposes of determining daily average values of monitored parameters. The definition shall specify the times at which an operating day begins and ends.

              (3) For emission points included in an emissions average, the Notification of Compliance Status shall include the values of all parameters needed for input to the emission credit and debit equations in § 63.150 (g) and (h), calculated or measured according to the procedures in § 63.150 (g) and (h) of this subpart, and the resulting calculation of credits and debits for the first quarter of the year. The first quarter begins on the compliance date specified in § 63.100 of subpart F.
              (4) If any emission point is subject to this subpart and to other standards as specified in § 63.110 of this subpart and if the provisions of § 63.110 of this subpart allow the owner or operator to choose which testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions will be followed, then the Notification of Compliance Status shall indicate which rule's requirements will be followed for testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping.
              (5) An owner or operator who transfers a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream for treatment pursuant to § 63.132(g) shall include in the Notification of Compliance Status the name and location of the transferee and a description of the Group 1 wastewater stream or residual sent to the treatment facility.
              (6) An owner or operator complying with § 63.113(i) shall include in the Notification of Compliance Status, or where applicable, a supplement to the Notification of Compliance Status, the name and location of the transferee, and the identification of the Group 1 process vent.
              (c) The owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall submit Periodic Reports.
              (1) Except as specified under paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section, a report containing the information in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section shall be submitted semiannually no later than 60 calendar days after the end of each 6-month period. The first report shall be submitted no later than 8 months after the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due and shall cover the 6-month period beginning on the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, for an owner or operator of a source complying with the provisions of §§ 63.113 through 63.147 for any emission points, Periodic Reports shall include all information specified in §§ 63.117 and 63.118 for process vents, § 63.122 for storage vessels, §§ 63.129 and 63.130 for transfer operations, and § 63.146 for process wastewater, including reports of periods when monitored parameters are outside their established ranges.
              (i) For each parameter or parameters required to be monitored for a control device, the owner or operator shall establish a range of parameter values to ensure that the device is being applied, operated and maintained properly. As specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, these parameter values and the definition of an operating day shall be approved as part of and incorporated into the source's Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, as appropriate.
              (ii) The parameter monitoring data for Group 1 emission points and emission points included in emissions averages that are required to perform continuous monitoring shall be used to determine compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices. For each excursion, except for excused excursions, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions.

              (A) An excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), or (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3) of this section. For a control device or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), or (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device or recovery device.
              (1) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is outside the permitted range.
              (2) When the period of control device or recovery device operation is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
              (3) When the period of control device or recovery device operation is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than one of the hours during the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data.
              (4) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data compression systems approved under § 63.151(g)(4), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less than 4 data values recorded during the hour.

              (B) The number of excused excursions for each control device or recovery device for each semiannual period is specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(1) through (c)(2)(ii)(B)(6) of this section. This paragraph applies to sources required to submit Periodic Reports semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-month period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
              (1) For the first semiannual period—six excused excursions.
              (2) For the second semiannual period—five excused excursions.
              (3) For the third semiannual period—four excused excursions.
              (4) For the fourth semiannual period—three excused excursions.
              (5) For the fifth semiannual period—two excused excursions.
              (6) For the sixth and all subsequent semiannual periods—one excused excursion.

              (C) A monitored parameter that is outside its established range or monitoring data that are not collected are excursions. However, if the conditions in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(1) or (c)(2)(ii)(C)(2) of this section are met, these excursions are not violations and do not count toward the number of excused excursions for determining compliance.
              (1) Periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction when the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.102(a)(4).
              (2) Periods of nonoperation. During periods of nonoperation of the chemical manufacturing process unit, or portion thereof, that results in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.
              (D) Nothing in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of subpart A, F, or G of this part.
              (E) Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, except paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, shall apply only to emission points and control devices or recovery devices for which continuous monitoring is required by §§ 63.113 through 63.150.
              (iii) Periodic Reports shall include the daily average values of monitored parameters for both excused and unexcused excursions, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. For excursions caused by lack of monitoring data, the duration of periods when monitoring data were not collected shall be specified.
              (iv) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply to any storage vessel for which the owner or operator is not required, by the applicable monitoring plan established under § 63.120(d)(2), to keep continuous records. If continuous records are required, the owner or operator shall specify, in the monitoring plan, whether the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this section apply.
              (3) If any performance tests are reported in a Periodic Report, the following information shall be included:
              (i) One complete test report shall be submitted for each test method used for a particular kind of emission point tested. A complete test report shall contain the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) For additional tests performed for the same kind of emission point using the same method, results and any other information required in § 63.117 for process vents, § 63.129 for transfer, and § 63.146 for process wastewater shall be submitted, but a complete test report is not required.
              (4) Periodic Reports shall include the information in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iv) of this section, as applicable:

              (i) For process vents, reports of process changes as required under § 63.118 (g), (h), (i), and (j) of this subpart,

              (iii) Notification if any Group 2 emission point becomes a Group 1 emission point, including a compliance schedule as required in § 63.100 of subpart F of this part, and
              (iv) For gas streams sent for disposal pursuant to § 63.113(i) or for process wastewater streams sent for treatment pursuant to § 63.132(g), reports of changes in the identity of the transferee.
              (5) The owner or operator of a source shall submit quarterly reports for all emission points included in an emissions average.
              (i) The quarterly reports shall be submitted no later than 60 calendar days after the end of each quarter. The first report shall be submitted with the Notification of Compliance Status no later than 5 months after the compliance date specified in § 63.100 of subpart F.
              (ii) The quarterly reports shall include the information specified in this paragraph for all emission points included in an emissions average.
              (A) The credits and debits calculated each month during the quarter;
              (B) A demonstration that debits calculated for the quarter are not more than 1.30 times the credits calculated for the quarter, as required under § 63.150(e)(4) of this subpart.
              (C) The values of any inputs to the credit and debit equations in § 63.150 (g) and (h) of this subpart that change from month to month during the quarter or that have changed since the previous quarter;
              (D) Results of any performance tests conducted during the reporting period including one complete report for each test method used for a particular kind of emission point as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
              (E) Reports of daily average values of monitored parameters for both excused and unexcused excursions as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. For excursions caused by lack of monitoring data, the duration of periods when monitoring data were not collected shall be specified.
              (iii) Paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall govern the use of monitoring data to determine compliance for Group 1 and Group 2 points included in emissions averages. For storage vessels to which the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply (as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section), the owner or operator is required to comply with the provisions of the applicable monitoring plan, and monitoring records may be used to determine compliance.
              (iv) Every fourth quarterly report shall include the following:
              (A) A demonstration that annual credits are greater than or equal to annual debits as required by § 63.150(e)(3) of this subpart; and
              (B) A certification of compliance with all the emissions averaging provisions in § 63.150 of this subpart.
              (6) The owner or operator of a source shall submit reports quarterly for particular emission points not included in an emissions average under the circumstances described in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (c)(6)(v) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall submit quarterly reports for a period of one year for an emission point that is not included in an emissions average if:
              (A) The emission point has more excursions, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, than the number of excused excursions allowed under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section for a semiannual reporting period; and
              (B) The Administrator requests the owner or operator to submit quarterly reports for the emission point.
              (ii) The quarterly reports shall include all information in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section applicable to the emission point(s) for which quarterly reporting is required under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section. Information applicable to other emission points within the source shall be submitted in the semiannual reports required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
              (iii) Quarterly reports shall be submitted no later than 60 calendar days after the end of each quarter.

              (iv) After quarterly reports have been submitted for an emission point for one year, the owner or operator may return to semiannual reporting for the emission point unless the Administrator requests the owner or operator to continue to submit quarterly reports.
              (v) Paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall govern the use of monitoring data to determine compliance for Group 1 emission points. For storage vessels to which the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply (as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section), the owner or operator is required to comply with the provisions of the applicable monitoring plan, and monitoring records may be used to determine compliance.
              (d) Other reports shall be submitted as specified in subpart A of this part or in §§ 63.113 through 63.151 of this subpart. These reports are:
              (1) Reports of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction required by § 63.10(d)(5) of subpart A. The start-up, shutdown and malfunction reports may be submitted on the same schedule as the Periodic Reports required under paragraph (c) of this section instead of the schedule specified in § 63.10(d)(5) of subpart A.
              (2) For storage vessels, the notifications of inspections required by § 63.122 (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this subpart.
              (3) For owners or operators of sources required to request approval for a nominal control efficiency for use in calculating credits for an emissions average, the information specified in § 63.150(i) of this subpart.
              (4) If an owner or operator transfers for disposal a gas stream that has the characteristics specified in § 63.107(b) through (h) or meets the criteria specified in § 63.107(i) to an off-site location or an on-site location not owned or operated by the owner or operator of the source and the vent stream was not included in the information submitted with the Notification of Compliance Status or a previous periodic report, the owner or operator shall submit a supplemental report. The supplemental report shall be submitted no later than July 23, 2001 or with the next periodic report, whichever is later. The report shall provide the information listed in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) The chemical manufacturing process unit(s) that is the origin of all or part of the vent stream that exits the process vent.
              (ii) The type(s) of unit operations (i.e., an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor) that creates the vent stream that exits the process vent.
              (iii) For a Group 2 process vent, the last recovery device, if any.
              (iv) For a Group 1 process vent, the identity of the transferee.
              (e) An owner or operator subject to this subpart shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section with the operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority. The owner or operator shall submit written updates as amendments to the operating permit application on the schedule and under the circumstances described in § 63.151(j) of this subpart. Notwithstanding, if the owner or operator has an operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, the owner or operator shall follow the schedule and format required by the permitting authority.
              (1) The information specified in § 63.151 (f) or (g) of this subpart for any emission points for which the owner or operator requests approval to monitor a unique parameter or use an alternative monitoring and recording system, and
              (2) The information specified in § 63.151(d) of this subpart for points included in an emissions average.
              (3) The information specified in § 63.151(e) of this subpart for points not included in an emissions average.
              (4) The information specified in § 63.151(h) as applicable.

              (f) Owners or operators required to keep continuous records by §§ 63.118, 63.130, 63.147, 63.150, or other sections of this subpart shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(7) of this section, unless an alternative recordkeeping system has been requested and approved under § 63.151(f) or (g) or § 63.152(e) or under § 63.8(f) of subpart A of this part, and except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section or in paragraph (g) of this section. If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to § 63.120(d)(2)(i) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(7) of this section apply.
              (1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once every 15 minutes.
              (2) The owner or operator shall record either:
              (i) Each measured data value; or
              (ii) Block average values for 15-minute or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period or at least one measured data value per minute if measured more frequently than once per minute.
              (3) If the daily average value of a monitored parameter for a given operating day is within the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator shall either:
              (i) Retain block hourly average values for that operating day for 5 years and discard, at or after the end of that operating day, the 15-minute or more frequent average values and readings recorded under paragraph (f)(2) of this section; or
              (ii) Retain the data recorded in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for 5 years.
              (4) If the daily average value of a monitored parameter for a given operating day is outside the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator shall retain the data recorded that operating day under paragraph (f)(2) of this section for 5 years.
              (5) Daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for each operating day, and retained for 5 years, except as specified in paragraphs (f)(6) and (f)(7) of this section.
              (i) The daily average shall be calculated as the average of all values for a monitored parameter recorded during the operating day. The average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous.
              (ii) The operating day shall be the period defined in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status. It may be from midnight to midnight or another daily period.
              (6) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are within the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were within the range and retain this record for 5 years rather than calculating and recording a daily average for that operating day. For these operating days, the records required in paragraph (f)(3) of this section shall also be retained for 5 years.
              (7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (f)(7)(i) through (f)(7)(v) of this section shall not be included in any average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process or control device operation when monitors are not operating.
              (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
              (ii) Start-ups;
              (iii) Shutdowns;
              (iv) Malfunctions;
              (v) Periods of non-operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.
              (g) For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section as alternatives to the continuous operating parameter monitoring and recordkeeping provisions listed in §§ 63.114, 63.117, and 63.118 for process vents, §§ 63.127, 63.129, and 63.130 for transfer operations, §§ 63.143, 63.146, and 63.147 for wastewater, and/or § 63.152(f), except that § 63.152(f)(7) shall apply. The owner or operator shall retain each record required by paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section as provided in § 63.103(c) of subpart F of this part, except as provided otherwise in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section.

              (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, and is not required to retain more frequent monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(vi) of this section are met. An owner or operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the periodic report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
              (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) through (g)(1)(iii)(C) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;
              (B) The running average is based on at least 6 1-hour average values; and
              (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
              (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.
              (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v)(A) through (g)(1)(v)(C) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
              (A) Upon initial installation.
              (B) Annually after initial installation.
              (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.
              (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (g)(1)(vi) (A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
              (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraph (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage; log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in § 63.103(c) of subpart F of this part, except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.

              (C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
              
              (D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(B) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description shall, at all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after its creation. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.
              (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
              (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next periodic report. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.
              (ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average value for each day, and shall notify the Administrator in the next periodic report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
              (iv) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A) and (g)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.
              (A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.102(a)(4).
              (B) An excused excursion, as described in § 63.152(c)(2)(ii) (B) and (C), shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2).

              Definitions.
              All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in this section as follows, except as provided in any subpart that references this subpart.
              
                Batch process means a process in which the equipment is fed intermittently or discontinuously. Processing then occurs in this equipment after which the equipment is generally emptied. Examples of industries that use batch processes include pharmaceutical production and pesticide production.
              
                Batch product-process equipment train means the collection of equipment (e.g., connectors, reactors, valves, pumps, etc.) configured to produce a specific product or intermediate by a batch process.
              
                Bench-scale batch process means a batch process (other than a research and development facility) that is operated on a small scale, such as one capable of being located on a laboratory bench top. This bench-scale equipment will typically include reagent feed vessels, a small reactor and associated product separator, recovery and holding equipment. These processes are only capable of producing small quantities of product.
              
                Bottoms receiver means a tank that collects distillation bottoms before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.
              
                Closed-loop system means an enclosed system that returns process fluid to the process and is not vented to the atmosphere except through a closed-vent system.
              
                Closed-purge system means a system or combination of system and portable containers, to capture purged liquids. Containers must be covered or closed when not being filled or emptied.
              
                Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and that is composed of hard-piping, ductwork, connections and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from a piece or pieces of equipment to a control device or back into a process.
              
                Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion of organic hazardous air pollutant emissions.
              
                Compliance date means the dates specified in § 63.100(k) or § 63.100(l)(3) of subpart F of this part for process units subject to subpart F of this part; the dates specified in § 63.190(e) of subpart I of this part for process units subject to subpart I of this part. For sources subject to other subparts in 40 CFR part 63 that reference this subpart, compliance date will be defined in those subparts. However, the compliance date for § 63.170 shall be no later than 3 years after the effective date of those subparts unless otherwise specified in such other subparts.
              
                Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipe lines or a pipe line and a piece of equipment. A common connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the purpose of this regulation. For the purpose of reporting and recordkeeping, connector means joined fittings that are not inaccessible, glass, or glass-lined as described in § 63.174(h) of this subpart.

              (4) An undesired side reaction to occur.
              
                In gas/vapor service means that a piece of equipment in organic hazardous air pollutant service contains a gas or vapor at operating conditions.

                Note:
                Vapor pressures may be determined by the methods described in 40 CFR 60.485(e)(1).
              
              
                In liquid service means that a piece of equipment in organic hazardous air pollutant service is not in gas/vapor service.

                Initial start-up means the first time a new or reconstructed source begins production. Initial start-up does not include operation solely for testing equipment. Initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups (as defined in this section) of process units following malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.
              
                Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller, and connectors nominally 0.75 inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 0.5 inches and connectors greater than nominally 0.75 inches associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.
              
                Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of liquid dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an existing evaporated drip.
              
                Nonrepairable means that it is technically infeasible to repair a piece of equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process unit shutdown.
              
                On-site or On site means, with respect to records required to be maintained by this subpart, that the records are stored at a location within a major source which encompasses the affected source. On-site includes, but is not limited to, storage at the chemical manufacturing process unit to which the records pertain, or storage in central files elsewhere at the major source.
              
                Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except pressure relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
              
                Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
              
                Polymerizing monomer means a molecule or compound usually containing carbon and of relatively low molecular weight and simple structure (e.g., hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, styrene), which is capable of conversion to polymers, synthetic resins, or elastomers by combination with itself due to heat generation caused by a pump mechanical seal surface, contamination by a seal fluid (e.g., organic peroxides or chemicals that will form organic peroxides), or a combination of both with the resultant polymer buildup causing rapid mechanical seal failure.
              
                Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
              
                Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 psig or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
              
                Process unit means a chemical manufacturing process unit as defined in subpart F of this part, a process subject to the provisions of subpart I of this part, or a process subject to another subpart in 40 CFR part 63 that references this subpart.
              
                Process unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit or part of a process unit consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a process unit shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit or part of the process unit of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown, is not a process unit shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process unit shutdowns.
              
                Recapture device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals, but not normally for use, reuse, or sale. Recapture devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon absorbers, and condensers.
              
                Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use or reuse. Recovery devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon absorbers, and condensers. For purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart, recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
              
                Repaired means that equipment:
              (1) Is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart, and
              (2) Unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in § 63.180 (b) and (c), as appropriate, to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.
              
                Routed to a process or route to a process means the emissions are conveyed by hard-piping or a closed vent system to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominately recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process; and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not organic hazardous air pollutants; and/or incorporated into a product; and/or recovered.
              
                Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take non-routine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
              
                Screwed connector means a threaded pipe fitting where the threads are cut on the pipe wall and the fitting requires only two pieces to make the connection (i.e., the pipe and the fitting).
              
                Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.
              
                Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system operating pressure.
              
                Start-up means the setting in operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.
              
                Surge control vessel means feed drums, recycle drums, and intermediate vessels. Surge control vessels are used within a process unit (as defined in the specific subpart that references this subpart) when in-process storage, mixing, or management of flow rates or volumes is needed to assist in production of a product.

              § 63.162
              Standards: General.
              (a) Compliance with this subpart will be determined by review of the records required by § 63.181 of this subpart and the reports required by § 63.182 of this subpart, review of performance test results, and by inspections.

              (b)(1) An owner or operator may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.170, and §§ 63.172 through 63.174 of this subpart as provided in § 63.177.
              (2) If the Administrator makes a determination that a means of emission limitation is a permissible alternative to the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.170, and §§ 63.172 through 63.174 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with the alternative.
              (c) Each piece of equipment in a process unit to which this subpart applies shall be identified such that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that is not subject to this subpart. Identification of the equipment does not require physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by designation of process unit boundaries by some form of weatherproof identification.
              (d) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the requirements of this subpart.
              (e) Equipment that is in organic HAP service less than 300 hours per calendar year is excluded from the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.174 of this subpart and § 63.178 of this subpart if it is identified as required in § 63.181(j) of this subpart.
              (f) When each leak is detected as specified in §§ 63.163 and 63.164; §§ 63.168 and 63.169; and §§ 63.172 through 63.174 of this subpart, the following requirements apply:
              (1) Clearly identify the leaking equipment.
              (2) The identification on a valve may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in §§ 63.168(f)(3), and 63.175(e)(7)(i)(D) of this subpart, and no leak has been detected during the follow-up monitoring. If the owner or operator elects to comply using the provisions of § 63.174(c)(1)(i) of this subpart, the identification on a connector may be removed after it is monitored as specified in § 63.174(c)(1)(i) and no leak is detected during that monitoring.
              (3) The identification which has been placed on equipment determined to have a leak, except for a valve or for a connector that is subject to the provisions of § 63.174(c)(1)(i), may be removed after it is repaired.
              (g) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, all terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), refer to the standard calendar periods unless specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the requirement.
              (1) If the initial compliance date does not coincide with the beginning of the standard calendar period, an owner or operator may elect to utilize a period beginning on the compliance date, or may elect to comply in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section.
              (2) Time periods specified in this subpart for completion of required tasks may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part. For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
              (3) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date does not coincide with the beginning of the calendar period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) or (g)(3)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.
              (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or
              (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.

              (4) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during each period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.
              (h) In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is detected, it is a violation of this subpart to fail to take action to repair the leaks within the specified time. If action is taken to repair the leaks within the specified time, failure of that action to successfully repair the leak is not a violation of this subpart. However, if the repairs are unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the owner or operator shall take further action as required by applicable provisions of this subpart.

              § 63.163
              Standards: Pumps in light liquid service.
              (a) The provisions of this section apply to each pump that is in light liquid service.
              (1) The provisions are to be implemented on the dates specified in the specific subpart in 40 CFR part 63 that references this subpart in the phases specified below:
              (i) For each group of existing process units at existing sources subject to the provisions of subparts F or I of this part, the phases of the standard are:
              (A) Phase I, beginning on the compliance date;

              (C) Phase III, beginning no later than 21/2 years after the compliance date.
              (ii) For new sources subject to the provisions of subparts F or I of this part, the applicable phases of the standard are:
              (A) After initial start-up, comply with the Phase II requirements; and
              (B) Beginning no later than 1 year after initial start-up, comply with the Phase III requirements.
              (2) The owner or operator of a source subject to the provisions of subparts F or I of this part may elect to meet the requirements of a later phase during the time period specified for an earlier phase.
              (3) Sources subject to other subparts in 40 CFR part 63 that reference this subpart shall comply on the dates specified in the applicable subpart.
              (b)(1) The owner or operator of a process unit subject to this subpart shall monitor each pump monthly to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart and shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, except as provided in § 63.162(b) of this subpart and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section.
              (2) The instrument reading, as determined by the method as specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart, that defines a leak in each phase of the standard is:
              (i) For Phase I, an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million or greater.
              (ii) For Phase II, an instrument reading of 5,000 parts per million or greater.
              (iii) For Phase III, an instrument reading of:
              (A) 5,000 parts per million or greater for pumps handling polymerizing monomers;
              (B) 2,000 parts per million or greater for pumps in food/medical service; and
              (C) 1,000 parts per million or greater for all other pumps.
              (3) Each pump shall be checked by visual inspection each calendar week for indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal. If there are indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal, a leak is detected.
              (c)(1) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or § 63.171 of this subpart.
              (2) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected. First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the following practices where practicable:
              (i) Tightening of packing gland nuts.
              (ii) Ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and temperature.
              (3) For pumps in Phase III to which a 1,000 parts per million leak definition applies, repair is not required unless an instrument reading of 2,000 parts per million or greater is detected.

              (d)(1) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the first monitoring period whether to calculate percent leaking pumps on a process unit basis or on a source-wide basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percent calculations shall be made on the same basis.
              (2) If, in Phase III, calculated on a 6-month rolling average, the greater of either 10 percent of the pumps in a process unit or three pumps in a process unit leak, the owner or operator shall implement a quality improvement program for pumps that complies with the requirements of § 63.176 of this subpart.
              (3) The number of pumps at a process unit shall be the sum of all the pumps in organic HAP service, except that pumps found leaking in a continuous process unit within 1 month after start-up of the pump shall not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one monitoring period only.

              (4) Percent leaking pumps shall be determined by the following equation:
              
              %PL = ((PL−PS)/(PT−PS)) × 100
              
              
                where:
                
                %PL = Percent leaking pumps
                PL = Number of pumps found leaking as determined through monthly monitoring as required in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
                PT = Total pumps in organic HAP service, including those meeting the criteria in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
                PS = Number of pumps leaking within 1 month of start-up during the current monitoring period.
              
              
              (e) Each pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, provided the following requirements are met:
              (1) Each dual mechanical seal system is:
              (i) Operated with the barrier fluid at a pressure that is at all times greater than the pump stuffing box pressure; or
              (ii) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to a control device that complies with the requirements of § 63.172 of this subpart; or
              (iii) Equipped with a closed-loop system that purges the barrier fluid into a process stream.
              (2) The barrier fluid is not in light liquid service.
              (3) Each barrier fluid system is equipped with a sensor that will detect failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both.

              (a) The provisions of this section apply to valves that are either in gas service or in light liquid service.
              (1) The provisions are to be implemented on the dates set forth in the specific subpart in 40 CFR part 63 that references this subpart as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), or (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (i) For each group of existing process units at existing sources subject to the provisions of subpart F or I of this part, the phases of the standard are:
              (A) Phase I, beginning on the compliance date;
              (B) Phase II, beginning no later than 1 year after the compliance date; and

              (A) After initial start-up, comply with the Phase II requirements; and
              (B) Beginning no later than 1 year after initial start-up, comply with the Phase III requirements.
              (iii) Sources subject to other subparts in 40 CFR part 63 that reference this subpart shall comply on the dates specified in the applicable subpart.
              (2) The owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart may elect to meet the requirements of a later phase during the time period specified for an earlier phase.
              (3) The use of monitoring data generated before April 22, 1994 to qualify for less frequent monitoring is governed by the provisions of § 63.180(b)(6) of this subpart.
              (b) The owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall monitor all valves, except as provided in § 63.162(b) of this subpart and paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, at the intervals specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and shall comply with all other provisions of this section, except as provided in § 63.171, § 63.177, § 63.178, and § 63.179 of this subpart.

              (1) The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart.
              
              (2) The instrument reading that defines a leak in each phase of the standard is:
              (i) For Phase I, an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million or greater.
              (ii) For Phase II, an instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater.
              (iii) For Phase III, an instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater.
              (c) In Phases I and II, each valve shall be monitored quarterly.
              (d) In Phase III, the owner or operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified below:
              (1) At process units with 2 percent or greater leaking valves, calculated according to paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall either:
              (i) Monitor each valve once per month; or
              (ii) Within the first year after the onset of Phase III, implement a quality improvement program for valves that complies with the requirements of § 63.175 (d) or (e) of this subpart and monitor quarterly.
              (2) At process units with less than 2 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once each quarter, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section.
              (3) At process units with less than 1 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 2 quarters.
              (4) At process units with less than 0.5 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 4 quarters.

              (e)(1) Percent leaking valves at a process unit shall be determined by the following equation:
              
              %VL = (VL/(VT + VC)) × 100
              
              
                where:
                
                %VL = Percent leaking valves as determined through periodic monitoring required in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
                VL = Number of valves found leaking excluding nonrepairables as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
                VT = Total valves monitored, in a monitoring period excluding valves monitored as required by (f)(3) of this section.
                VC = Optional credit for removed valves = 0.67 × net number (i.e., total removed−total added) of valves in organic HAP service removed from process unit after the date set forth in § 63.100(k) of subpart F for existing process units, and after the date of initial start-up for new sources. If credits are not taken, then VC = 0.
              
              
              (2) For use in determining monitoring frequency, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the percent leaking valves shall be calculated as a rolling average of two consecutive monitoring periods for monthly, quarterly, or semiannual monitoring programs; and as an average of any three out of four consecutive monitoring periods for annual monitoring programs.
              (3)(i) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified and included in the percent leaking calculation in a previous period) up to a maximum of 1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP service at a process unit may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking valves for subsequent monitoring periods.
              (ii) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP service at a process unit, the number of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP service shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves.
              (f)(1) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected, except as provided in § 63.171 of this subpart.
              (2) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after each leak is detected.
              (3) When a leak has been repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least once within the first 3 months after its repair.

              (i) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in § 63.180 (b) and (c), as appropriate, to determine whether the valve has resumed leaking.
              
              (ii) Periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3), if the timing of the monitoring period coincides with the time specified in this paragraph (f)(3). Alternatively, other monitoring may be performed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3), regardless of whether the timing of the monitoring period for periodic monitoring coincides with the time specified in this paragraph (f)(3).
              (iii) If a leak is detected by monitoring that is conducted pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall follow the provisions of paragraphs (f)(3)(iii)(A) and (f)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, to determine whether that valve must be counted as a leaking valve for purposes of § 63.168(e) of this subpart.
              (A) If the owner or operator elected to use periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve.
              (B) If the owner or operator elected to use other monitoring, prior to the periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.
              (g) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the following practices where practicable:
              (1) Tightening of bonnet bolts,
              (2) Replacement of bonnet bolts,
              (3) Tightening of packing gland nuts, and
              (4) Injection of lubricant into lubricated packing.
              (h) Any valve that is designated, as described in § 63.181(b)(7)(i) of this subpart, as an unsafe-to-monitor valve is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator of the valve determines that the valve is unsafe to monitor because monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section; and
              (2) The owner or operator of the valve has a written plan that requires monitoring of the valve as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times, but not more frequently than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable.
              (i) Any valve that is designated, as described in § 63.181(b)(7)(ii) of this subpart, as a difficult-to-monitor valve is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator of the valve determines that the valve cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface or it is not accessible at anytime in a safe manner;
              (2) The process unit within which the valve is located is an existing source or the owner or operator designates less than 3 percent of the total number of valves in a new source as difficult-to-monitor; and
              (3) The owner or operator of the valve follows a written plan that requires monitoring of the valve at least once per calendar year.
              (j) Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves in organic HAP service is exempt from the requirements for monthly monitoring and a quality improvement program specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in organic HAP service for leaks once each quarter, or comply with paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section.

              Standards: Delay of repair.
              (a) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days is technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown. Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next process unit shutdown.
              (b) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in organic HAP service.
              (c) Delay of repair for valves, connectors, and agitators is also allowed if:
              (1) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and
              (2) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed or recovered in a control device complying with § 63.172 of this subpart.
              (d) Delay of repair for pumps is also allowed if:
              (1) Repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a new system that the owner or operator has determined under the provisions of § 63.176(d) of this subpart will provide better performance or:
              (i) A dual mechanical seal system that meets the requirements of § 63.163(e) of this subpart,

              (1) For each group of existing process units within an existing source, by no later than 12 months after the compliance date, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors, except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.
              (2) For new sources, within the first 12 months after initial start-up or by no later than 12 months after the date of promulgation of a specific subpart that references this subpart, whichever is later, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors, except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.
              (3) After conducting the initial survey required in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall perform all subsequent monitoring of connectors at the frequencies specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(v) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section:
              (i) Once per year (i.e., 12-month period), if the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was 0.5 percent or greater during the last required annual or biennial monitoring period.
              (ii) Once every 2 years, if the percent leaking connectors was less than 0.5 percent during the last required monitoring period. An owner or operator may comply with this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the connectors in the first year and the remainder of the connectors in the second year. The percent leaking connectors will be calculated for the total of all monitoring performed during the 2-year period.
              (iii) If the owner or operator of a process unit in a biennial leak detection and repair program calculates less than 0.5 percent leaking connectors from the 2-year monitoring period, the owner or operator may monitor the connectors one time every 4 years. An owner or operator may comply with the requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 20 percent of the connectors each year until all connectors have been monitored within 4 years.
              (iv) If a process unit complying with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section using a 4-year monitoring interval program has greater than or equal to 0.5 percent but less than 1 percent leaking connectors, the owner or operator shall increase the monitoring frequency to one time every 2 years. An owner or operator may comply with the requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the connectors in the first year and the remainder of the connectors in the second year. The owner or operator may again elect to use the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section when the percent leaking connectors decreases to less than 0.5 percent.

              (v) If a process unit complying with requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section using a 4-year monitoring interval program has 1 percent or greater leaking connectors, the owner or operator shall increase the monitoring frequency to one time per year. The owner or operator may again elect to use the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section when the percent leaking connectors decreases to less than 0.5 percent.
              (4) The use of monitoring data generated before April 22, 1994 to qualify for less frequent monitoring is governed by the provisions of § 63.180(b)(6).
              (c)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, each connector that has been opened or has otherwise had the seal broken shall be monitored for leaks when it is reconnected or within the first 3 months after being returned to organic hazardous air pollutants service. If the monitoring detects a leak, it shall be repaired according to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, unless it is determined to be nonrepairable, in which case it is counted as a nonrepairable connector for the purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

              (ii) As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may choose not to monitor connectors that have been opened or otherwise had the seal broken. In this case, the owner or operator may not count nonrepairable connectors for the purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The owner or operator shall calculate the percent leaking connectors for the monitoring periods described in paragraph (b) of this section, by setting the nonrepairable component, CAN, in the equation in paragraph (i)(2) of this section to zero for all monitoring periods.
              (iii) An owner or operator may switch alternatives described in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section at the end of the current monitoring period he is in, provided that it is reported as required in § 63.182 of this subpart and begin the new alternative in annual monitoring. The initial monitoring in the new alternative shall be completed no later than 12 months after reporting the switch.
              (2) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each screwed connector 2 inches or less in nominal inside diameter installed in a process unit before the dates specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(2)(iv) of this section may:
              (i) Comply with the requirements of § 63.169 of this subpart, and
              (ii) Be monitored for leaks within the first 3 months after being returned to organic hazardous air pollutants service after having been opened or otherwise had the seal broken. If that monitoring detects a leak, it shall be repaired according to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
              (iii) For sources subject to subparts F and I of this part, the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to screwed connectors installed before December 31, 1992.
              (iv) For sources not identified in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to screwed connectors installed before the date of proposal of the applicable subpart of this part that references this subpart.

              (f) Any connector that is designated, as described in § 63.181(b)(7)(i) of this subpart, as an unsafe-to-monitor connector is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator determines that the connector is unsafe to monitor because personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a result of complying with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section; and
              (2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires monitoring of the connector as frequently as practicable during safe to monitor periods, but not more frequently than the periodic schedule otherwise applicable.

              (1) The owner or operator determines that repair personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with paragraph (d) of this section; and
              (2) The connector will be repaired before the end of the next scheduled process unit shutdown.
              (h)(1) Any connector that is inaccessible or is ceramic or ceramic-lined (e.g., porcelain, glass, or glass-lined), is exempt from the monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section and from the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of § 63.181 and § 63.182 of this subpart. An inaccessible connector is one that is:

              (iii) Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the connector by a monitor probe;
              (iv) Unable to be reached from a wheeled scissor-lift or hydraulic-type scaffold which would allow access to connectors up to 7.6 meters (25 feet) above the ground;
              (v) Inaccessible because it would require elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters above a permanent support surface or would require the erection of scaffold; or
              (vi) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical lines, or would risk damage to equipment.
              (2) If any inaccessible or ceramic or ceramic-lined connector is observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to be leaking, the leak shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected, except as provided in § 63.171 of this subpart and paragraph (g) of this section.
              (3) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.
              (i) For use in determining the monitoring frequency, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the percent leaking connectors shall be calculated as specified in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section.

              (1) For the first monitoring period, use the following equation:
              
              % CL = CL/(Ct + CC) × 100
              
              
                where:
                
                % CL = Percent leaking connectors as determined through periodic monitoring required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                CL = Number of connectors measured at 500 parts per million or greater, by the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart.
                Ct = Total number of monitored connectors in the process unit.
                CC = Optional credit for removed connectors = 0.67 × net (i.e., total removed—total added) number of connectors in organic hazardous air pollutants service removed from the process unit after the compliance date set forth in the applicable subpart for existing process units, and after the date of initial start-up for new process units. If credits are not taken, then CC = 0.
              
              

              (2) For subsequent monitoring periods, use the following equation:
              
              % CL = [(CL− CAN)/(Ct + CC)] × 100
              
              
                where:
                
                % CL = Percent leaking connectors as determined through periodic monitoring required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                CL = Number of connectors, including nonrepairables, measured at 500 parts per million or greater, by the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart.
                CAN = Number of allowable nonrepairable connectors, as determined by monitoring required in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c) of this section, not to exceed 2 percent of the total connector population, Ct.
                Ct = Total number of monitored connectors, including nonrepairables, in the process unit.
                CC = Optional credit for removed connectors = 0.67 × net number (i.e., total removed—total added) of connectors in organic hazardous air pollutants service removed from the process unit after the compliance date set forth in the applicable subpart for existing process units, and after the date of initial start-up for new process units. If credits are not taken, then CC = 0.
              
              
              (j) Optional credit for removed connectors. If an owner or operator eliminates a connector subject to monitoring under paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator may receive credit for elimination of the connector, as described in paragraph (i) of this section, provided the requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(4) are met.
              (1) The connector was welded after the date of proposal of the specific subpart that references this subpart.
              (2) The integrity of the weld is demonstrated by monitoring it according to the procedures in § 63.180(b) of this subpart or by testing using X-ray, acoustic monitoring, hydrotesting, or other applicable method.
              (3) Welds created after the date of proposal but before the date of promulgation of a specific subpart that references this subpart are monitored or tested by 3 months after the compliance date specified in the applicable subpart.
              (4) Welds created after promulgation of the subpart that references this subpart are monitored or tested within 3 months after being welded.
              (5) If an inadequate weld is found or the connector is not welded completely around the circumference, the connector is not considered a welded connector and is therefore not exempt from the provisions of this subpart.

              § 63.175
              Quality improvement program for valves.
              (a) In Phase III, an owner or operator may elect to comply with one of the alternative quality improvement programs specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. The decision to use one of these alternative provisions to comply with the requirements of § 63.168(d)(1)(ii) of this subpart must be made during the first year of Phase III for existing process units and for new process units.
              (b) An owner or operator of a process unit subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this section shall comply with those requirements until the process unit has fewer than 2 percent leaking valves, calculated as a rolling average of 2 consecutive quarters, as specified in § 63.168(e) of this subpart.
              (c) After the process unit has fewer than 2 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements in § 63.168 of this subpart, to continue to comply with the requirements in paragraph (e) (or (d), if appropriate) of this section, or comply with both the requirements in § 63.168 and § 63.175.
              (1) If the owner or operator elects to continue the quality improvement program, the owner or operator is exempt from the requirements for performance trials as specified in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, or further progress as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, as long as the process unit has fewer than 2 percent leaking valves calculated according to § 63.168(e).
              (2) If the owner or operator elects to comply with both paragraph (e) of this section and § 63.168 of this subpart, he may also take advantage of the lower monitoring frequencies associated with lower leak rates in § 63.168 (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this subpart.
              (3) If the owner or operator elects not to continue the quality improvement program, the program is no longer an option if the process unit again exceeds 2 percent leaking valves, and in such case, monthly monitoring will be required.
              (d) The following requirements shall be met if an owner or operator elects to use a quality improvement program to demonstrate further progress:
              (1) The owner or operator shall continue to comply with the requirements in § 63.168 of this subpart except each valve shall be monitored quarterly.
              (2) The owner or operator shall collect the following data, and maintain records as required in § 63.181(h)(1) of this subpart, for each valve in each process unit subject to the quality improvement program:

              (i) The maximum instrument reading observed in each monitoring observation before repair, the response factor for the stream if appropriate, the instrument model number, and date of the observation.
              
              (ii) Whether the valve is in gas or light liquid service.
              (iii) If a leak is detected, the repair methods used and the instrument readings after repair.
              (3) The owner or operator shall continue to collect data on the valves as long as the process unit remains in the quality improvement program.
              (4) The owner or operator must demonstrate progress in reducing the percent leaking valves each quarter the process unit is subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) and (d)(4)(iii) of this section.

              (i) Demonstration of progress shall mean that for each quarter there is at least a 10-percent reduction in the percent leaking valves from the percent leaking valves determined for the preceding monitoring period. The percent leaking valves shall be calculated as a rolling average of two consecutive quarters of monitoring data. The percent reduction shall be calculated using the rolling average percent leaking valves, according to the following:
              
              %LVR = (%LVAVG1 − %LVAVG2 / %LVAVG1 × 100
              
              
                where:
                
                %LVR = Percent leaking valve reduction.
                %LVAVG1 = (%VLi + %VLi = 1)/2.
                %LVAVG2 = (%VLi = 1 + %VLi = 2)/2.
                
                where:
                
                %VLi, %VLi = 1, %VLi = 2 are percent leaking valves calculated for subsequent monitoring periods, i, i + 1, i + 2.
              
              
              (ii) An owner or operator who fails for two consecutive rolling averages to demonstrate at least a 10-percent reduction per quarter in percent leaking valves, and whose overall average percent reduction based on two or more rolling averages is less than 10 percent per quarter, shall either comply with the requirements in § 63.168(d)(1)(i) of this subpart using monthly monitoring or shall comply using a quality improvement program for technology review as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, the schedule for performance trials and valve replacements remains as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (iii) As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (d)(4)(i), an owner or operator may use the procedure specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(A) and (d)(4)(iii)(B) of this section to demonstrate progress in reducing the percent leaking valves.
              (A) The percent reduction that must be achieved each quarter shall be calculated as follows:
              
                ER22AP94.293
              
              
                %RR = percent reduction required each quarter, as calculated according to § 63.168(e)
                %VL = percent leaking valves, calculated according to § 63.168(e), at the time elected to use provisions of § 63.168(d)(1)(ii)
              
              
              (B) The owner or operator shall achieve less than 2 percent leaking valves no later than 2 years after electing to use the demonstration of progress provisions in § 63.175(d) of this subpart.
              (e) The following requirements shall be met if an owner or operator elects to use a quality improvement program of technology review and improvement:
              (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in § 63.168 of this subpart except the requirement for monthly monitoring in § 63.168(d)(1)(i) of this subpart does not apply.
              (2) The owner or operator shall collect the data specified below, and maintain records as required in § 63.181(h)(2), for each valve in each process unit subject to the quality improvement program. The data may be collected and the records may be maintained on a process unit or group of process units basis. The data shall include the following:
              (i) Valve type (e.g., ball, gate, check); valve manufacturer; valve design (e.g., external stem or actuating mechanism, flanged body); materials of construction; packing material; and year installed.
              (ii) Service characteristics of the stream such as operating pressure, temperature, line diameter, and corrosivity.
              (iii) Whether the valve is in gas or light liquid service.

              (iv) The maximum instrument readings observed in each monitoring observation before repair, response factor for the stream if adjusted, instrument model number, and date of the observation.
              (v) If a leak is detected, the repair methods used and the instrument readings after repair.
              (vi) If the data will be analyzed as part of a larger analysis program involving data from other plants or other types of process units, a description of any maintenance or quality assurance programs used in the process unit that are intended to improve emission performance.
              (3) The owner or operator shall continue to collect data on the valves as long as the process unit remains in the quality improvement program.
              (4) The owner or operator shall inspect all valves removed from the process unit due to leaks. The inspection shall determine which parts of the valve have failed and shall include recommendations, as appropriate, for design changes or changes in specifications to reduce leak potential.
              (5)(i) The owner or operator shall analyze the data collected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to determine the services, operating or maintenance practices, and valve designs or technologies that have poorer than average emission performance and those that have better than average emission performance. The analysis shall determine if specific trouble areas can be identified on the basis of service, operating conditions or maintenance practices, equipment design, or other process specific factors.
              (ii) The analysis shall also be used to identify any superior performing valve technologies that are applicable to the service(s), operating conditions, or valve designs associated with poorer than average emission performance. A superior performing valve technology is one for which a group of such valves has a leak frequency of less than 2 percent for specific applications in such a process unit. A candidate superior performing valve technology is one demonstrated or reported in the available literature or through a group study as having low emission performance and as being capable of achieving less than 2 percent leaking valves in the process unit.
              (iii) The analysis shall include consideration of:
              (A) The data obtained from the inspections of valves removed from the process unit due to leaks,
              (B) Information from the available literature and from the experience of other plant sites that will identify valve designs or technologies and operating conditions associated with low emission performance for specific services, and
              (C) Information on limitations on the service conditions for the valve design and operating conditions as well as information on maintenance procedures to ensure continued low emission performance.
              (iv) The data analysis may be conducted through an inter- or intra-company program (or through some combination of the two approaches) and may be for a single process unit, a company, or a group of process units.
              (v) The first analysis of the data shall be completed no later than 18 months after the start of Phase III. The first analysis shall be performed using a minimum of two quarters of data. An analysis of the data shall be done each year the process unit is in the quality improvement program.
              (6) A trial evaluation program shall be conducted at each plant site for which the data analysis does not identify superior performing valve designs or technologies that can be applied to the operating conditions and services identified as having poorer than average performance, except as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(v) of this section. The trial program shall be used to evaluate the feasibility of using in the process unit the valve designs or technologies that have been identified by others as having low emission performance.

              (i) The trial program shall include on-line trials of valves or operating and maintenance practices that have been identified in the available literature or in analysis by others as having the ability to perform with leak rates below 2 percent in similar services, as having low probability of failure, or as having no external actuating mechanism in contact with the process fluid. If any of the candidate superior performing valve technologies is not included in the performance trials, the reasons for rejecting specific technologies from consideration shall be documented as required in § 63.181(h)(5)(ii) of this subpart.
              (ii) The number of valves in the trial evaluation program shall be the lesser of 1 percent or 20 valves for programs involving single process units and the lesser of 1 percent or 50 valves for programs involving groups of process units.
              (iii) The trial evaluation program shall specify and include documentation of:
              (A) The candidate superior performing valve designs or technologies to be evaluated, the stages for evaluating the identified candidate valve designs or technologies, including the estimated time period necessary to test the applicability;
              (B) The frequency of monitoring or inspection of the equipment;
              (C) The range of operating conditions over which the component will be evaluated; and
              (D) Conclusions regarding the emission performance and the appropriate operating conditions and services for the trial valves.
              (iv) The performance trials shall initially be conducted for, at least, a 6-month period beginning not later than 18 months after the start of Phase III. Not later than 24 months after the start of Phase III, the owner or operator shall have identified valve designs or technologies that, combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, operate with low emission performance for specific applications in the process unit. The owner or operator shall continue to conduct performance trials as long as no superior performing design or technology has been identified, except as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(vi) of this section. The compilation of candidate and demonstrated superior emission performance valve designs or technologies shall be amended in the future, as appropriate, as additional information and experience is obtained.
              (v) Any plant site with fewer than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with fewer than 100 total employees shall be exempt from trial evaluations of valves. Plant sites exempt from the trial evaluations of valves shall begin the program at the start of the fourth year of Phase III.
              (vi) An owner or operator who has conducted performance trials on all candidate superior emission performance technologies suitable for the required applications in the process unit may stop conducting performance trials provided that a superior performing design or technology has been demonstrated or there are no technically feasible candidate superior technologies remaining. The owner or operator shall prepare an engineering evaluation documenting the physical, chemical, or engineering basis for the judgment that the superior emission performance technology is technically infeasible or demonstrating that it would not reduce emissions.
              (7) Each owner or operator who elects to use a quality improvement program for technology review and improvement shall prepare and implement a valve quality assurance program that details purchasing specifications and maintenance procedures for all valves in the process unit. The quality assurance program may establish any number of categories, or classes, of valves as needed to distinguish among operating conditions and services associated with poorer than average emission performance as well as those associated with better than average emission performance. The quality assurance program shall be developed considering the findings of the data analysis required under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, if applicable, the findings of the trial evaluation required in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, and the operating conditions in the process unit. The quality assurance program shall be reviewed and, as appropriate, updated each year as long as the process unit has 2 percent or more leaking valves.
              (i) The quality assurance program shall:
              (A) Establish minimum design standards for each category of valves. The design standards shall specify known critical parameters such as tolerance, manufacturer, materials of construction, previous usage, or other applicable identified critical parameters;

              (B) Require that all equipment orders specify the design standard (or minimum tolerances) for the valve;
              
              (C) Include a written procedure for bench testing of valves that specifies performance criteria for acceptance of valves and specifies criteria for the precision and accuracy of the test apparatus. All valves repaired off-line after preparation of the quality assurance plan shall be bench-tested for leaks. This testing may be conducted by the owner or operator of the process unit, by the vendor, or by a designated representative. The owner or operator shall install only those valves that have been documented through bench-testing to be nonleaking.
              (D) Require that all valves repaired on-line be monitored using the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart for leaks for 2 successive months, after repair.
              (E) Provide for an audit procedure for quality control of purchased equipment to ensure conformance with purchase specifications. The audit program may be conducted by the owner or operator of the process unit or by a designated representative.
              (F) Detail off-line valve maintenance and repair procedures. These procedures shall include provisions to ensure that rebuilt or refurbished valves will meet the design specifications for the valve type and will operate such that emissions are minimized.
              (ii) The quality assurance program shall be established no later than the start of the third year of Phase III for plant sites with 400 or more valves or owned by a corporation with 100 or more employees; and no later than the start of the fourth year of Phase III for plant sites with less than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with less than 100 employees.
              (8) Beginning at the start of the third year of Phase III for plant sites with 400 or more valves or owned by a corporation with 100 or more employees and at the start of the fourth year of Phase III for plant sites with less than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with less than 100 employees, each valve that is replaced for any reason shall be replaced with a new or modified valve that complies with the quality assurance standards for the valve category and that is identified as superior emission performance technology. Superior emission performance technology means valves or valve technologies identified with emission performance that, combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, will result in less than 2 percent leaking valves for specific applications in a large population, except as provided in paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The valves shall be maintained as specified in the quality assurance program.
              (ii) If a superior emission performance technology cannot be identified, then valve replacement shall be with one of (if several) the lowest emission performance technologies that has been identified for the specific application.

              § 63.176
              Quality improvement program for pumps.
              (a) In Phase III, if, on a 6-month rolling average, the greater of either 10 percent of the pumps in a process unit (or plant site) or three pumps in a process unit (or plant site) leak, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this section as specified below:
              (1) Pumps that are in food/medical service or in polymerizing monomer service shall comply with all requirements except for those specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
              (2) Pumps that are not in food/medical or polymerizing monomer service shall comply with all requirements of this section.
              (b) The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this section until the number of leaking pumps is less than the greater of either 10 percent of the pumps or three pumps, calculated as a 6-month rolling average, in the process unit (or plant site). Once the performance level is achieved, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in § 63.163 of this subpart.

              (c) If in a subsequent monitoring period, the process unit (or plant site) has greater than 10 percent of the pumps leaking or three pumps leaking (calculated as a 6-month rolling average), the owner or operator shall resume the quality improvement program starting at performance trials.
              (d) The quality improvement program shall include the following:
              (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in § 63.163 of this subpart.
              (2) The owner or operator shall collect the following data, and maintain records as required in § 63.181(h)(3), for each pump in each process unit (or plant site) subject to the quality improvement program. The data may be collected and the records may be maintained on a process unit or plant site basis.
              (i) Pump type (e.g., piston, horizontal or vertical centrifugal, gear, bellows); pump manufacturer; seal type and manufacturer; pump design (e.g., external shaft, flanged body); materials of construction; if applicable, barrier fluid or packing material; and year installed.
              (ii) Service characteristics of the stream such as discharge pressure, temperature, flow rate, corrosivity, and annual operating hours.
              (iii) The maximum instrument readings observed in each monitoring observation before repair, response factor for the stream if appropriate, instrument model number, and date of the observation.
              (iv) If a leak is detected, the repair methods used and the instrument readings after repair.
              (v) If the data will be analyzed as part of a larger analysis program involving data from other plants or other types of process units, a description of any maintenance or quality assurance programs used in the process unit that are intended to improve emission performance.
              (3) The owner or operator shall continue to collect data on the pumps as long as the process unit (or plant site) remains in the quality improvement program.
              (4) The owner or operator shall inspect all pumps or pump seals which exhibited frequent seal failures and were removed from the process unit due to leaks. The inspection shall determine the probable cause of the pump seal failure or of the pump leak and shall include recommendations, as appropriate, for design changes or changes in specifications to reduce leak potential.
              (5)(i) The owner or operator shall analyze the data collected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section to determine the services, operating or maintenance practices, and pump or pump seal designs or technologies that have poorer than average emission performance and those that have better than average emission performance. The analysis shall determine if specific trouble areas can be identified on the basis of service, operating conditions or maintenance practices, equipment design, or other process specific factors.
              (ii) The analysis shall also be used to determine if there are superior performing pump or pump seal technologies that are applicable to the service(s), operating conditions, or pump or pump seal designs associated with poorer than average emission performance. A superior performing pump or pump seal technology is one with a leak frequency of less than 10 percent for specific applications in the process unit or plant site. A candidate superior performing pump or pump seal technology is one demonstrated or reported in the available literature or through a group study as having low emission performance and as being capable of achieving less than 10 percent leaking pumps in the process unit (or plant site).
              (iii) The analysis shall include consideration of:
              (A) The data obtained from the inspections of pumps and pump seals removed from the process unit due to leaks;
              (B) Information from the available literature and from the experience of other plant sites that will identify pump designs or technologies and operating conditions associated with low emission performance for specific services; and

              (C) Information on limitations on the service conditions for the pump seal technology operating conditions as well as information on maintenance procedures to ensure continued low emission performance.
              
              (iv) The data analysis may be conducted through an inter- or intra-company program (or through some combination of the two approaches) and may be for a single process unit, a plant site, a company, or a group of process units.
              (v) The first analysis of the data shall be completed no later than 18 months after the start of the quality improvement program. The first analysis shall be performed using a minimum of 6 months of data. An analysis of the data shall be done each year the process unit is in the quality improvement program.
              (6) A trial evaluation program shall be conducted at each plant site for which the data analysis does not identify use of superior performing pump seal technology or pumps that can be applied to the areas identified as having poorer than average performance, except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(v) of this section. The trial program shall be used to evaluate the feasibility of using in the process unit (or plant site) the pump designs or seal technologies, and operating and maintenance practices that have been identified by others as having low emission performance.
              (i) The trial program shall include on-line trials of pump seal technologies or pump designs and operating and maintenance practices that have been identified in the available literature or in analysis by others as having the ability to perform with leak rates below 10 percent in similar services, as having low probability of failure, or as having no external actuating mechanism in contact with the process fluid. If any of the candidate superior performing pump seal technologies or pumps is not included in the performance trials, the reasons for rejecting specific technologies from consideration shall be documented as required in § 63.181(h)(5)(ii).
              (ii) The number of pump seal technologies or pumps in the trial evaluation program shall be the lesser of 1 percent or two pumps for programs involving single process units and the lesser of 1 percent or five pumps for programs involving a plant site or groups of process units. The minimum number of pumps or pump seal technologies in a trial program shall be one.
              (iii) The trial evaluation program shall specify and include documentation of:
              (A) The candidate superior performing pump seal designs or technologies to be evaluated, the stages for evaluating the identified candidate pump designs or pump seal technologies, including the time period necessary to test the applicability;
              (B) The frequency of monitoring or inspection of the equipment;
              (C) The range of operating conditions over which the component will be evaluated; and
              (D) Conclusions regarding the emission performance and the appropriate operating conditions and services for the trial pump seal technologies or pumps.
              (iv) The performance trials shall initially be conducted, at least, for a 6-month period beginning not later than 18 months after the start of the quality improvement program. No later than 24 months after the start of the quality improvement program, the owner or operator shall have identified pump seal technologies or pump designs that, combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, operate with low emission performance for specific applications in the process unit. The owner or operator shall continue to conduct performance trials as long as no superior performing design or technology has been identified, except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(vi) of this section. The initial list of superior emission performance pump designs or pump seal technologies shall be amended in the future, as appropriate, as additional information and experience is obtained.

              (v) Any plant site with fewer than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with fewer than 100 employees shall be exempt from trial evaluations of pump seals or pump designs. Plant sites exempt from the trial evaluations of pumps shall begin the pump seal or pump replacement program at the start of the fourth year of the quality improvement program.
              
              (vi) An owner or operator who has conducted performance trials on all alternative superior emission performance technologies suitable for the required applications in the process unit may stop conducting performance trials provided that a superior performing design or technology has been demonstrated or there are no technically feasible alternative superior technologies remaining. The owner or operator shall prepare an engineering evaluation documenting the physical, chemical, or engineering basis for the judgment that the superior emission performance technology is technically infeasible or demonstrating that it would not reduce emissions.
              (7) Each owner or operator shall prepare and implement a pump quality assurance program that details purchasing specifications and maintenance procedures for all pumps and pump seals in the process unit. The quality assurance program may establish any number of categories, or classes, of pumps as needed to distinguish among operating conditions and services associated with poorer than average emission performance as well as those associated with better than average emission performance. The quality assurance program shall be developed considering the findings of the data analysis required under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, if applicable, the findings of the trial evaluation required in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, and the operating conditions in the process unit. The quality assurance program shall be updated each year as long as the process unit has the greater of either 10 percent or more leaking pumps or has three leaking pumps.
              (i) The quality assurance program shall:
              (A) Establish minimum design standards for each category of pumps or pump seal technology. The design standards shall specify known critical parameters such as tolerance, manufacturer, materials of construction, previous usage, or other applicable identified critical parameters;
              (B) Require that all equipment orders specify the design standard (or minimum tolerances) for the pump or the pump seal;
              (C) Provide for an audit procedure for quality control of purchased equipment to ensure conformance with purchase specifications. The audit program may be conducted by the owner or operator of the plant site or process unit or by a designated representative; and
              (D) Detail off-line pump maintenance and repair procedures. These procedures shall include provisions to ensure that rebuilt or refurbished pumps and pump seals will meet the design specifications for the pump category and will operate such that emissions are minimized.
              (ii) The quality assurance program shall be established no later than the start of the third year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with 400 or more valves or 100 or more employees; and no later than the start of the fourth year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with less than 400 valves and less than 100 employees.
              (8) Beginning at the start of the third year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with 400 or more valves or 100 or more employees and at the start of the fourth year of the quality improvement program for plant sites with less than 400 valves and less than 100 employees, the owner or operator shall replace, as described in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) and (d)(8)(ii) of this section, the pumps or pump seals that are not superior emission performance technology with pumps or pump seals that have been identified as superior emission performance technology and that comply with the quality assurance standards for the pump category. Superior emission performance technology is that category or design of pumps or pump seals with emission performance which, when combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, will result in less than 10 percent leaking pumps for specific applications in the process unit or plant site. Superior emission performance technology includes material or design changes to the existing pump, pump seal, seal support system, installation of multiple mechanical seals or equivalent, or pump replacement.

              (i) Pumps or pump seals shall be replaced at the rate of 20 percent per year based on the total number of pumps in light liquid service. The calculated value shall be rounded to the nearest nonzero integer value. The minimum number of pumps or pump seals shall be one. Pump replacement shall continue until all pumps subject to the requirements of § 63.163 of this subpart are pumps determined to be superior performance technology.
              (ii) The owner or operator may delay replacement of pump seals or pumps with superior technology until the next planned process unit shutdown, provided the number of pump seals and pumps replaced is equivalent to the 20 percent or greater annual replacement rate.
              (iii) The pumps shall be maintained as specified in the quality assurance program.
            
            
              § 63.177
              Alternative means of emission limitation: General.
              (a) Permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation under section 112(h)(3) of the Act shall be governed by the following procedures in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
              (b) Where the standard is an equipment, design, or operational requirement:
              (1) Each owner or operator applying for permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation under § 63.6(g) of subpart A of this part shall be responsible for collecting and verifying emission performance test data for an alternative means of emission limitation.

              (1) Each owner or operator applying for permission shall be responsible for collecting and verifying test data for an alternative means of emission limitation.
              (2) For each kind of equipment for which permission is requested, the emission reduction achieved by the required work practices shall be demonstrated for a minimum period of 12 months.
              (3) For each kind of equipment for which permission is requested, the emission reduction achieved by the alternative means of emission limitation shall be demonstrated.
              (4) Each owner or operator applying for permission shall commit, in writing, for each kind of equipment to work practices that provide for emission reductions equal to or greater than the emission reductions achieved by the required work practices.
              (5) The Administrator will compare the demonstrated emission reduction for the alternative means of emission limitation to the demonstrated emission reduction for the required work practices and will consider the commitment in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              (6) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the same or greater emission reduction as the required work practices of this subpart.
              (d) An owner or operator may offer a unique approach to demonstrate the alternative means of emission limitation.
              (e)(1) Manufacturers of equipment used to control equipment leaks of an organic HAP may apply to the Administrator for permission for an alternative means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of the organic HAP achieved by the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart.
              (2) The Administrator will grant permission according to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
            
            
              § 63.178
              Alternative means of emission limitation: Batch processes.

              (a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.171 and §§ 63.173 through 63.176, an owner or operator of a batch process that operates in organic HAP service during the calendar year may comply with one of the standards specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or the owner or operator may petition for approval of an alternative standard under the provisions of § 63.177 of this subpart. The alternative standards of this section provide the options of pressure testing or monitoring the equipment for leaks. The owner or operator may switch among the alternatives provided the change is documented as specified in § 63.181.
              (b) The following requirements shall be met if an owner or operator elects to use pressure testing of batch product-process equipment to demonstrate compliance with this subpart. An owner or operator who complies with the provisions of this paragraph is exempt from the monitoring provisions of § 63.163, §§ 63.168 and 63.169, and §§ 63.173 through 63.176 of this subpart.
              (1) Each time equipment is reconfigured for production of a different product or intermediate, the batch product-process equipment train shall be pressure-tested for leaks before organic HAP is first fed to the equipment and the equipment is placed in organic HAP service.
              (i) When the batch product-process train is reconfigured to produce a different product, pressure testing is required only for the new or disturbed equipment.
              (ii) Each batch product process that operates in organic HAP service during a calendar year shall be pressure tested at least once during that calendar year.
              (iii) Pressure testing is not required for routine seal breaks, such as changing hoses or filters, which are not part of the reconfiguration to produce a different product or intermediate.
              (2) The batch product process equipment shall be tested either using the procedures specified in § 63.180(f) of this subpart for pressure or vacuum loss or with a liquid using the procedures specified in § 63.180(g) of this subpart.
              (3)(i) For pressure or vacuum tests, a leak is detected if the rate of change in pressure is greater than 6.9 kilopascals (1 psig) in 1 hour or if there is visible, audible, or olfactory evidence of fluid loss.
              (ii) For pressure tests using a liquid, a leak is detected if there are indications of liquids dripping or if there is other evidence of fluid loss.
              (4)(i) If a leak is detected, it shall be repaired and the batch product-process equipment shall be retested before start-up of the process.
              (ii) If a batch product-process fails the retest or the second of two consecutive pressure tests, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 calendar days after the second pressure test, provided the conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section are met.
              (c) The following requirements shall be met if an owner or operator elects to monitor the equipment to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance with this subpart.
              (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.170, and §§ 63.172 through 63.176 of this subpart.
              (2) The equipment shall be monitored for leaks by the method specified in § 63.180(b) of this subpart when the equipment is in organic HAP service, in use with an acceptable surrogate volatile organic compound which is not an organic HAP, or is in use with any other detectable gas or vapor.
              (3) The equipment shall be monitored for leaks as specified below:
              (i) Each time the equipment is reconfigured for the production of a new product, the reconfigured equipment shall be monitored for leaks within 30 days of start-up of the process. This initial monitoring of reconfigured equipment shall not be included in determining percent leaking equipment in the process unit.
              (ii) Connectors shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements in § 63.174 of this subpart.
              (iii) Equipment other than connectors shall be monitored at the frequencies specified in table 1 of this subpart. The operating time shall be determined as the proportion of the year the batch product-process that is subject to the provisions of this subpart is operating.

              (iv) The monitoring frequencies specified in table 1 of this subpart are not requirements for monitoring at specific intervals and can be adjusted to accommodate process operations. An owner or operator may monitor anytime during the specified monitoring period (e.g., month, quarter, year), provided the monitoring is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the last monitoring campaign. For example, if the equipment is not operating during the scheduled monitoring period, the monitoring can be done during the next period when the process is operating.
              (4) If a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the replacement equipment is not available providing the following conditions are met:
              (1) Equipment supplies have been depleted and supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted.
              (2) The repair is made no later than 10 calendar days after delivery of the replacement equipment.
            
            
              § 63.179
              Alternative means of emission limitation: Enclosed-vented process units.
              Process units enclosed in such a manner that all emissions from equipment leaks are vented through a closed-vent system to a control device meeting the requirements of § 63.172 of this subpart are exempt from the requirements of § 63.163, through 63.171, and §§ 63.173 and 63.174 of this subpart. The enclosure shall be maintained under a negative pressure at all times while the process unit is in operation to ensure that all emissions are routed to a control device.
            
            
              § 63.180
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the test methods and procedures requirements provided in this section.
              (b) Monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall comply with the following requirements:
              (1) Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (2)(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in Section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, water, air, or other inerts which are not organic HAP's or VOC's, the average stream response factor may be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
              (ii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
              (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (4) Calibration gases shall be:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and
              (ii) Mixtures of methane in air at the concentrations specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
              (A) For Phase I, a mixture of methane or other compounds, as applicable, in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million.

              (B) For Phase II, a mixture of methane or other compounds, as applicable, and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million for agitators, 5,000 parts per million for pumps, and 500 parts per million for all other equipment, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
              (C) For Phase III, a mixture of methane or other compounds, as applicable, and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million methane for agitators; 2,000 parts per million for pumps in food/medical service; 5,000 parts per million for pumps in polymerizing monomer service; 1,000 parts per million for all other pumps; and 500 parts per million for all other equipment, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
              (iii) The instrument may be calibrated at a higher methane concentration than the concentration specified for that piece of equipment. The concentration of the calibration gas may exceed the concentration specified as a leak by no more than 2,000 parts per million. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 parts per million above the concentration specified as a leak and the highest scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately equal to 10,000 parts per million. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, the owner or operator need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.
              (5) Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in organic HAP service, in use with an acceptable surrogate volatile organic compound which is not an organic HAP, or is in use with any other detectable gas or vapor.
              (6) Monitoring data that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may be used to qualify for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.168(d)(2) and (d)(3) or § 63.174(b)(3)(ii) or (b)(3)(iii) of this subpart provided the data meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The data were obtained before April 22, 1994.
              (ii) The departures from the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.168(c) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every six weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring at a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in this subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
              (c) When equipment is monitored for compliance as required in §§ 63.164(i), 63.165(a), and 63.172(f) or when equipment subject to a leak definition of 500 ppm is monitored for leaks as required by this subpart, the owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to not adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. In such case, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
              (1) The requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section shall apply.
              (2) The background level shall be determined, using the same procedures that will be used to determine whether the equipment is leaking.
              (3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              (4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.

              (d)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed 5 percent by weight on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used.
              (2)(i) An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed 5 percent by weight. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              (ii) Conversely, the owner or operator may determine that the organic HAP content of the process fluid does not exceed 5 percent by weight by, for example, accounting for 98 percent of the content and showing that organic HAP is less than 3 percent.
              (3) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.
              (4) Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.
              (e) When a flare is used to comply with § 63.172(d), the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet organic HAP or TOC concentration.
              (1) Conduct a visible emission test using the techniques specified in § 63.11(b)(4).
              (2) Determine the net heating value of the gas being combusted using the techniques specified in § 63.11(b)(6).
              (3) Determine the exit velocity using the techniques specified in either § 63.11(b)(7)(i) (and § 63.11(b)(7)(iii), where applicable) or § 63.11(b)(8), as appropriate.
              (f) The following procedures shall be used to pressure test batch product-process equipment for pressure or vacuum loss to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 63.178(b)(3)(i) of this subpart.
              (1) The batch product-process equipment train shall be pressurized with a gas to a pressure less than the set pressure of any safety relief devices or valves or to a pressure slightly above the operating pressure of the equipment, or alternatively, the equipment shall be placed under a vacuum.
              (2) Once the test pressure is obtained, the gas source or vacuum source shall be shut off.
              (3) The test shall continue for not less than 15 minutes unless it can be determined in a shorter period of time that the allowable rate of pressure drop or of pressure rise was exceeded. The pressure in the batch product-process equipment shall be measured after the gas or vacuum source is shut off and at the end of the test period. The rate of change in pressure in the batch product-process equipment shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER22AP94.294
              
              
                where:
                
                Δ P/t = Change in pressure, psig/hr.
                Pf = Final pressure, psig.
                Pi = Initial pressure, psig.
                tf−ti = Elapsed time, hours.
              
              

              (4) The pressure shall be measured using a pressure measurement device (gauge, manometer, or equivalent) which has a precision of ±2.5 millimeter mercury in the range of test pressure and is capable of measuring pressures up to the relief set pressure of the pressure relief device. If such a pressure measurement device is not reasonably available, the owner or operator shall use a pressure measurement device with a precision of at least + 10 percent of the test pressure of the equipment and shall extend the duration of the test for the time necessary to detect a pressure loss or rise that equals a rate of one psig per hour.

              (a) The owner or operator of a new or existing coke oven battery equipped with a shed for the capture of coke oven emissions from coke oven doors and an emission control device for the collection of the emissions may comply with an alternative to the applicable visible emission limitations for coke oven doors in §§ 63.302 and 63.304 according to the procedures and requirements in this section.
              (b) To qualify for approval of an alternative standard, the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a test plan for the measurement of emissions. A copy of the request shall also be sent to the Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. The plan shall describe the procedures to be used for the measurement of particulate matter; the parameters to be measured that affect the shed exhaust rate (e.g., damper settings, fan power) and the procedures for measuring such parameters; and if applicable under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the procedures to be used for the measurement of benzene soluble organics, benzene, toluene, and xylene emitted from the control device for the shed. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days before any performance test is conducted.
              (c) A complete test plan is deemed approved if no disapproval is received within 60 days of the submittal to the Administrator. After approval of the test plan, the owner or operator shall;

              (1) Determine the efficiency of the control device for removal of particulate matter by conducting measurements at the inlet and the outlet of the emission control device using Method 5 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, with the filter box operated at ambient temperature and in a manner to avoid condensation, with a backup filter;
              
              (2) Measure the visible emissions from coke oven doors that escape capture by the shed using Method 22 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. For the purpose of approval of an alternative standard, no visible emissions may escape capture from the shed.
              (i) Visible emission observations shall be taken during conditions representative of normal operations, except that pushing shall be suspended and pushing emissions shall have cleared the shed; and
              (ii) Method 22 observations shall be performed by an observer certified according to the requirements of Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. The observer shall allow pushing emissions to be evacuated (typically 1 to 2 minutes) before making observations;
              (3) Measure the opacity of emissions from the control device using Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter during conditions representative of normal operations, including pushing; and
              (i) If the control device has multiple stacks, the owner or operator shall use an evaluation based on visible emissions and opacity to select the stack with the highest opacity for testing under this section;
              (ii) The highest opacity, expressed as a 6-minute average, shall be used as the opacity standard for the control device.
              (4) Thoroughly inspect all compartments of each air cleaning device prior to the performance test for proper operation and for changes that signal the potential for malfunction, including the presence of tears, holes, and abrasions in filter bags; damaged seals; and for dust deposits on the clean side of bags; and
              (5) Determine the allowable percent leaking doors under the shed using either of the following procedures:
              (i) Calculate the allowable percent leaking doors using the following equation:

                where
                
                PLD = Allowable percent leaking doors for alternative standard.
                PLDstd = Applicable visible emission limitation of percent leaking doors under this subpart that would otherwise apply to the coke oven battery, converted to the single-run limit according to Table 1.
                eff = Percent control efficiency for particulate matter for emission control device as determined according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

                where
                
                
                R = Ratio of measured emissions of benzene, toluene, and xylene to measured emissions of benzene soluble organics.
              
              
              (iii) If the allowable percent leaking coke oven doors is calculated to exceed 15 percent leaking coke oven doors under paragraphs (c)(5)(i) or (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall use 15 percent leaking coke oven doors for the purposes of this section.
              (6) Monitor the parameters that affect the shed exhaust flow rate.
              (7) The owner or operator may request alternative sampling procedures to those specified in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section by submitting details on the procedures and the rationale for their use to the Administrator. Alternative procedures shall not be used without approval from the Administrator.
              (8) The owner or operator shall inform the Administrator of the schedule for conducting testing under the approved test plan and give the Administrator the opportunity to observe the tests.
              (d) After calculating the alternative standard for allowable percent leaking coke oven doors, the owner or operator shall submit the following information to the Administrator:

              (iii) The parameter or parameters (e.g., fan power, damper position, or other) to be monitored and recorded to demonstrate that the exhaust flow rate measured during the test required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is maintained, and the monitoring plan for such parameter(s).
              (iv) If the application is for a new shed, one of the following demonstrations:
              (A) A demonstration, using modeling procedures acceptable to the Administrator, that the expected concentrations of particulate emissions (including benzene soluble organics) under the shed at the bench level, when the proposed alternative standard was being met, would not exceed the expected concentrations of particulate emissions (including benzene soluble organics) if the shed were not present, the regulations under this subpart were met, and the battery was in compliance with federally enforceable limitations on pushing emissions; or
              (B) A demonstration that the shed (including the evacuation system) has been designed in accordance with generally accepted engineering principles for the effective capture and control of particulate emissions (including benzene soluble organics) as measured at the shed's perimeter, its control device, and at the bench level.

              (1) Except for applications subject to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Administrator shall approve or disapprove an alternative standard as expeditiously as practicable. The Administrator shall approve an alternative standard, unless the Administrator determines that the approved test plan has not been followed, or any required calculations are incorrect, or any demonstration required under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section does not satisfy the applicable criteria under that paragraph. If the alternative standard is disapproved, the Administrator will issue a written notification to the owner or operator within the 60-day period.

              (2) The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable visible emission limitation for coke oven doors and all other requirements in this subpart prior to approval of an alternative standard. The owner or operator may apply for an alternative standard at any time after December 4, 1992.
              (3) An application for an alternative standard to the standard in § 63.304(b)(1)(i) for any shed that is not a new shed that is filed on or before June 15, 1993, is deemed approved if a notice of disapproval has not been received 60 days after submission of a complete request. An approval under paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall be valid for a period of 1 year.
              (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, no alternative standard shall be approved that exceeds 15 percent leaking coke oven doors (yard equivalent).
              (f) After approval of an alternative standard, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:
              (1) The owner or operator shall not discharge or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere coke oven emissions from coke oven doors under sheds that exceed an approved alternative standard for percent leaking coke oven doors under sheds.
              (i) All visible emission observations for compliance determinations shall be performed by a certified observer.
              (ii) Compliance with the alternative standard for doors shall be determined by a weekly performance test conducted according to the procedures and requirements in § 63.309(d)(5) and Method 303 in appendix A to this part.
              (iii) If the visible emission limitation is achieved for 12 consecutive observations, compliance shall be determined by monthly rather than weekly performance tests. If any exceedance occurs during a performance test, weekly performance tests shall be resumed.
              (iv) Observations taken at times other than those specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section shall be subject to the provisions of § 63.309(f).
              (2) The certified observer shall monitor the visible coke oven emissions escaping capture by the shed on a weekly basis. The provision in paragraph (f)(6) of this section is applicable if visible coke oven emissions are observed during periods when pushing emissions have cleared the shed.
              (3) The owner or operator shall not discharge or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere any visible emissions from the shed's control device exhibiting more than 0 percent opacity unless an alternative limit has been approved under paragraph (e) of this section.
              (4) The opacity of emissions from the control device for the shed shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements of either paragraph (f)(4)(i) or (f)(4)(ii) of this section, at the election of the owner or operator.
              (i) The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a continuous opacity monitor, and record the output of the system, for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged from the emission control system.
              (A) Each continuous opacity monitoring system shall meet the requirements of Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter; and
              (B) Each continuous opacity monitoring system shall be operated, calibrated, and maintained according to the procedures and requirements specified in part 52 of this chapter; or
              (ii) A certified observer shall monitor and record at least once each day during daylight hours, opacity observations for the control device for the shed using Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter.
              (5) The owner or operator shall visually inspect the structural integrity of the shed at least once a quarter for defects, such as deterioration of sheet metal (e.g., holes in the shed), that may allow the escape of visible emissions.
              (i) The owner or operator shall record the time and date a defect is first observed, the time and date the defect is corrected or repaired, and a brief description of repairs or corrective actions taken;
              (ii) The owner or operator shall temporarily repair the defect as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days after detection of the defect;

              (iii) Unless a major repair is required, the owner or operator shall perform a complete repair of the defect within 15 days of detection of the defect. If a major repair is required (e.g., replacement of large sections of the shed), the owner or operator shall submit a repair schedule to the enforcement agency.
              (6) If the no visible emission limit for the shed specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section is exceeded, the Administrator may require another test for the shed according to the approved test plan as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. If the certified observer observes visible coke oven emissions from the shed, except during periods of pushing or when pushing emissions have not cleared the shed, the owner or operator shall check to ensure that the shed and control device are working properly.
              (7) The owner or operator shall monitor the parameter(s) affecting shed exhaust flow rate, and record data, in accordance with the approved monitoring plan for these parameters.
              (8) The owner or operator shall not operate the exhaust system of the shed at an exhaust flow rate lower than that measured during the test required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as indicated by the monitored parameters.
              (g) Each side of a battery subject to an alternative standard for doors under this section shall be treated separately for purposes of §§ 63.306(c) (plan implementation) and 63.306(d) (plan revisions) of this subpart. In making determinations under these provisions for the side of the battery subject to an alternative standard, the requirement that exceedances be independent shall not apply. During any period when work practices for doors for both sides of the battery are required to be implemented, § 63.306(a)(3) shall apply in the same manner as if the provisions of a plan for a single emissions point were required to be implemented. Exceedances of the alternative standard for percent leaking doors under a shed is the only provision in this section implicating implementation of work practice requirements.
              (h) Multiple exceedances of the visible emission limitation for door leaks and/or the provisions of an alternative standard under this section for door leaks at a battery on a single day shall be considered a single violation.

After the visible emission limitation for a particular emission point is achieved for 90 consecutive days, any exceedances prior to the beginning of the 90 days are not included in making a determination under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
              (2) The owner or operator of a coke oven battery not subject to visible emission limitations under this subpart until December 31, 1995, shall:
              (i) Implement the provisions of the work practice plan pertaining to a particular emission point following the second exceedance in any consecutive 6-month period of a federally enforceable emission limitation for that emission point for coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake systems, or charging operations by no later than 3 days after receipt of written notification from the applicable enforcement agency; and
              (ii) Continue to implement such plan provisions for 90 consecutive days after the most recent written notification from the enforcement agency of an exceedance of the visible emission limitation.
              (d) Revisions to plan. Revisions to the work practice emission control plan will be governed by the provisions in this paragraph (d) and in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The reviewing authority is the Administrator or the delegated State, local, or Tribal authority.
              (1) The reviewing authority may request the owner or operator to review and revise as needed the work practice emission control plan for a particular emission point if there are 2 exceedances of the applicable visible emission limitation in the 6-month period that starts 30 days after the owner or operator is required to implement work practices under paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of a coke oven battery subject to visual emission limitations under this subpart, the second exceedance must be independent of the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
              (2) The reviewing authority may not request the owner or operator to review and revise the plan more than twice in any 12 consecutive month period for any particular emission point unless the reviewing authority disapproves the plan according to the provisions in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
              (3) If the certified observer calculates that a second exceedance (or, if applicable, a second independent exceedance) has occurred, the certified observer shall notify the owner or operator. No later than 10 days after receipt of such a notification, the owner or operator shall notify the reviewing authority of any finding of whether work practices are related to the cause or the solution of the problem. The notification is subject to review by the reviewing authority according to the provisions in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
              (4) The owner or operator shall submit a revised work practice plan within 60 days of notification from the reviewing authority under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless the reviewing authority grants an extension of time to submit the revised plan.
              (5) If the reviewing authority requires a plan revision, the reviewing authority may require the plan to address a subject area or areas in addition to those in paragraph (b) of this section, if the reviewing authority determines that without plan coverage of such an additional subject area, there is a reasonable probability of further exceedances of the visible emission limitation for the emission point for which a plan revision is required.

              (6) The reviewing authority may disapprove a plan revision required under paragraph (d) of this section if the reviewing authority determines that the revised plan is inadequate to prevent exceedances of the visible emission limitation under this subpart for the emission point for which a plan revision is required or, in the case of a battery not subject to visual emission limitations under this subpart, other federally enforceable emission limitations for such emission point. The reviewing authority may also disapprove the finding that may be submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section if the reviewing authority determines that a revised plan is needed to prevent exceedances of the applicable visible emission limitations.

              (c) The owner or operator shall temporarily seal any leak in the collecting main as soon as possible after detection, but no later than 4 hours after detection of the leak.
              (d) The owner or operator shall initiate a collecting main repair as expeditiously as possible, but no later than 5 calendar days after initial detection of the leak. The repair shall be completed within 15 calendar days after initial detection of the leak unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 63.309
              Performance tests and procedures.
              (a) Except as otherwise provided, a daily performance test shall be conducted each day, 7 days per week for each new and existing coke oven battery, the results of which shall be used in accordance with procedures specified in this subpart to determine compliance with each of the applicable visible emission limitations for coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake systems, and charging operations in this subpart. If a facility pushes and charges only at night, then that facility must, at its option, change their schedule and charge during daylight hours or provide adequate lighting so that visible emission inspections can be made at night. “Adequate lighting” will be determined by the enforcement agency.
              (1) Each performance test is to be conducted according to the procedures and requirements in this section and in Method 303 or 303A in appendix A to this part or Methods 9 and 22 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter (where applicable).
              (2) Each performance test is to be conducted by a certified observer.
              (3) The certified observer shall complete any reasonable safety training program offered by the owner or operator prior to conducting any performance test at a coke oven battery.
              (4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the owner or operator shall pay an inspection fee to the enforcement agency each calendar quarter to defray the costs of the daily performance tests required under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (i) The inspection fee shall be determined according to the following formula:
              
                ER27OC93.002
              
              
                where
                
                F = Fees to be paid by owner or operator.
                H = Total person hours for inspections: 4 hours for 1 coke oven battery, 6.25 hours for 2 coke oven batteries, 8.25 hours for 3 coke oven batteries. For more than 3 coke oven batteries, use these hours to calculate the appropriate estimate of person hours.
                S = Current average hourly rate for private visible emission inspectors in the relevant market.
              
              
              (ii) The enforcement agency may revise the value for H in equation 3 within 3 years after October 27, 1993 to reflect the amount of time actually required to conduct the inspections required under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall not be required to pay an inspection fee (or any part thereof) under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, for any monitoring or inspection services required by paragraph (a) of this section that the owner or operator can demonstrate are covered by other fees collected by the enforcement agency.

              (iv) Upon request, the enforcement agency shall provide the owner or operator information concerning the inspection services covered by any other fees collected by the enforcement agency, and any information relied upon under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
              (5)(i) The EPA shall be the enforcement agency during any period of time that a delegation of enforcement authority is not in effect or a withdrawal of enforcement authority under § 63.313 is in effect, and the Administrator is responsible for performing the inspections required by this section, pursuant to § 63.313(c).
              (ii) Within thirty (30) days of receiving notification from the Administrator that the EPA is the enforcement agency for a coke oven battery, the owner or operator shall enter into a contract providing for the inspections and performance tests required under this section to be performed by a Method 303 certified observer. The inspections and performance tests will be conducted at the expense of the owner or operator, during the period that the EPA is the implementing agency.
              (b) The enforcement agency shall commence daily performance tests on the applicable date specified in § 63.300 (a) or (c).
              (c) The certified observer shall conduct each performance test according to the requirements in this paragraph:
              (1) The certified observer shall conduct one run each day to observe and record visible emissions from each coke oven door (except for doors covered by an alternative standard under § 63.305), topside port lid, and offtake system on each coke oven battery. The certified observer also shall conduct five runs to observe and record the seconds of visible emissions per charge for five consecutive charges from each coke oven battery. The observer may perform additional runs as needed to obtain and record a visible emissions value (or set of values) for an emission point that is valid under Method 303 or Method 303A in appendix A to this part. Observations from fewer than five consecutive charges shall constitute a valid set of charging observations only in accordance with the procedures and conditions specified in sections 3.8 and 3.9 of Method 303 in appendix A to this part.
              (2) If a valid visible emissions value (or set of values) is not obtained for a performance test, there is no compliance determination for that day. Compliance determinations will resume on the next day that a valid visible emissions value (or set of values) is obtained.
              (3) After each performance test for a by-product coke oven battery, the certified observer shall check and record the collecting main pressure according to the procedures in section 6.3 of Method 303 in appendix A to this part.
              (i) The owner or operator shall demonstrate pursuant to Method 303 in appendix A to this part the accuracy of the pressure measurement device upon request of the certified observer;
              (ii) The owner or operator shall not adjust the pressure to a level below the range of normal operation during or prior to the inspection;
              (4) The certified observer shall monitor visible emissions from coke oven doors subject to an alternative standard under § 63.305 on the schedule specified in § 63.305(f).
              (5) If applicable, the certified observer shall monitor the opacity of any emissions escaping the control device for a shed covering doors subject to an alternative standard under § 63.305 on the schedule specified in § 63.305(f).
              (6) In no case shall the owner or operator knowingly block a coke oven door, or any portion of a door for the purpose of concealing emissions or preventing observations by the certified observer.
              (d) Using the observations obtained from each performance test, the enforcement agency shall compute and record, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Method 303 or 303A in appendix A to this part, for each day of operations on which a valid emissions value (or set of values) is obtained:
              (1) The 30-run rolling average of the percent leaking coke oven doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems on each coke oven battery, using the equations in sections 4.5.3.2, 5.6.5.2, and 5.6.6.2 of Method 303 (or section 3.4.3.2 of Method 303A) in appendix A to this part;

              (2) For by-product coke oven battery charging operations, the logarithmic 30-day rolling average of the seconds of visible emissions per charge for each battery, using the equation in section 3.9 of Method 303 in appendix A to this part;
              (3) For a battery subject to an alternative emission limitation for coke oven doors on by-product coke oven batteries pursuant to § 63.305, the 30-run rolling average of the percent leaking coke oven doors for any side of the battery not subject to such alternative emission limitation;
              (4) For a by-product coke oven battery subject to the small battery emission limitation for coke oven doors pursuant to § 63.304(b)(7), the 30-run rolling average of the number of leaking coke oven doors;
              (5) For an approved alternative emission limitation for coke oven doors according to § 63.305, the weekly or monthly observation of the percent leaking coke oven doors using Method 303 in appendix A to this part, the percent opacity of visible emissions from the control device for the shed using Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, and visible emissions from the shed using Method 22 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter;
              (e) The certified observer shall make available to the implementing agency as well as to the owner or operator, a copy of the daily inspection results by the end of the day and shall make available the calculated rolling average for each emission point to the owner or operator as soon as practicable following each performance test. The information provided by the certified observer is not a compliance determination. For the purpose of notifying an owner or operator of the results obtained by a certified observer, the person does not have to be certified.
              (f) Compliance shall not be determined more often than the schedule provided for performance tests under this section. If additional valid emissions observations are obtained (or in the case of charging, valid sets of emission observations), the arithmetic average of all valid values (or valid sets of values) obtained during the day shall be used in any computations performed to determine compliance under paragraph (d) of this section or determinations under § 63.306.
              (g) Compliance with the alternative standards for nonrecovery coke oven batteries in § 63.303; shed inspection, maintenance requirements, and monitoring requirements for parameters affecting the shed exhaust flow rate for batteries subject to alternative standards for coke oven doors under § 63.305; work practice emission control plan requirements in § 63.306; standards for bypass/bleeder stacks in § 63.307; and standards for collecting mains in § 63.308 is to be determined by the enforcement agency based on review of records and inspections.
              (h) For a flare installed to meet the requirements of § 63.307(b):
              (1) Compliance with the provisions in § 63.307(c) (visible emissions from flares) shall be determined using Method 22 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, with an observation period of 2 hours; and
              (2) Compliance with the provisions in § 63.307(b)(4) (flare pilot light) shall be determined using a thermocouple or any other equivalent device.
              (i) No observations obtained during any program for training or for certifying observers under this subpart shall be used to determine compliance with the requirements of this subpart or any other federally enforceable standard.
              (j) The owner or operator of a new nonrecovery coke oven battery shall conduct a performance test once each week to demonstrate compliance with the opacity limit in § 63.303(d)(1). The owner or operator shall conduct each performance test according to the procedures and requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Using a certified observer, determine the average opacity of five consecutive charges per week for each charging emissions capture system if charges can be observed according to the requirements of Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), except as specified in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Instead of the procedures in section 2.4 of Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), record observations to the nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals for at least five consecutive charges.

              (ii) Instead of the procedures in section 2.5 of Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), determine and record the highest 3-minute average opacity for each charge from the consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals.
              (2) Opacity observations are to start when the door is removed for charging and end when the door is replaced.
              (3) Using the observations recorded from each performance test, the certified observer shall compute and record the average of the highest 3-minute averages for five consecutive charges.
              (k) The owner or operator of a new nonrecovery coke oven battery shall conduct a performance test to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations for a charging emissions control device in § 63.303(d)(2) within 180 days of the compliance date that is specified for the affected source in § 63.300(a)(4) and report the results in the notification of compliance status. The owner or operator shall prepare a site-specific test plan according to the requirements in § 63.7(c) and shall conduct each performance test according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1) and paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) Determine the concentration of PM according to the following test methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
              (i) Method 1 to select sampling port locations and the number of traverse points. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
              (ii) Method 2, 2F, or 2G to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.
              (iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas.

              (iv) Method 4 to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.
              (v) Method 5 or 5D, as applicable, to determine the concentration of front half PM in the stack gas.
              (2) During each PM test run, sample only during periods of actual charging when the capture system fan and control device are engaged. Collect a minimum sample volume of 30 dry standard cubic feet (dscf) during each test run. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test. Each run must start at the beginning of a charge and finish at the end of a charge (i.e., sample for an integral number of charges).
              (3) Determine and record the total combined weight of tons of dry coal charged during the duration of each test run.
              (4) Compute the process-weighted mass emissions (Ep) for each test run using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
              
                ER15AP05.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ep = Process weighted mass emissions of PM, lb/ton;

                Q = Volumetric flow rate of stack gas, dscf/hr;
                T = Total time during a run that a sample is withdrawn from the stack during charging, hr;
                P = Total amount of dry coal charged during the test run, tons; and
                K = Conversion factor, 7,000 grains per pound (gr/lb).
              
              
              (l) The owner or operator of a new nonrecovery coke oven battery shall conduct subsequent performance tests for each charging emissions control device subject to the PM emissions limit in § 63.303(d)(2) at least once during each term of their title V operating permit.
              (m) Visible emission observations of a charging emissions control device required by § 63.303(d)(3)(iii) must be performed by a certified observer according to Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) for one 6-minute period.

              § 63.310
              Requirements for startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.

              (a) At all times including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall operate and maintain the coke oven battery and its pollution control equipment required under this subpart, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the levels required by any applicable performance standards under this subpart. Failure to adhere to the requirement of this paragraph shall not constitute a separate violation if a violation of an applicable performance or work practice standard has also occurred.
              (b) Each owner or operator of a coke oven battery shall develop, according to paragraph (c) of this section, a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes procedures for operating the battery, including associated air pollution control equipment, during a period of a startup, shutdown, or malfunction in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions, and procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable.
              (c) Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practicable after their occurrence.
              (d) In order for the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section to apply with respect to the observation (or set of observations) for a particular day, notification of a startup, shutdown, or a malfunction shall be made by the owner or operator:
              (1) If practicable, to the certified observer if the observer is at the facility during the occurrence; or
              (2) To the enforcement agency, in writing, within 24 hours of the occurrence first being documented by a company employee, and if the notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section was not made, an explanation of why no such notification was made.
              (e) Within 14 days of the notification made under paragraph (d) of this section, or after a startup or shutdown, the owner or operator shall submit a written report to the applicable permitting authority that:
              (1) Describes the time and circumstances of the startup, shutdown, or malfunction; and

              (f) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of internal reports which form the basis of each malfunction notification under paragraph (d) of this section.
              (g) To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator may use the standard operating procedures manual for the battery, provided the manual meets all the requirements for this section and is made available for inspection at reasonable times when requested by the Administrator.
              (h) The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan:
              (1) Does not address a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event that has occurred;
              (2) Fails to provide for the operation of the source (including associated air pollution control equipment) during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions; or
              (3) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable.
              (i) If the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a startup, shutdown, or malfunction has occurred, then an observation occurring during such startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not:

              § 63.312
              Existing regulations and requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator shall comply with all applicable State implementation plan emission limits and (subject to any expiration date) all federally enforceable emission limitations which are contained in an order, decree, permit, or settlement agreement for the control of emissions from offtake systems, topside port lids, coke oven doors, and charging operations in effect on September 15, 1992, or which have been modified according to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) Nothing in this subpart shall affect the enforcement of such State implementation plan emission limitations (or, subject to any expiration date, such federally enforceable emission limitations contained in an order, decree, permit, or settlement agreement) in effect on September 15, 1992, or which have been modified according to the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) No such State implementation plan emission limitation (or, subject to any expiration date, such federally enforceable emission limitation contained in an order, decree, permit, or settlement agreement) in effect on September 15, 1992, may be modified under the Act unless:
              (1) Such modification is consistent with all requirements of section 110 of the Act; and either
              (i) Such modification ensures that the applicable emission limitations and format (e.g., single pass v. multiday average) in effect on September 15, 1992, will continue in effect; or

              (ii) Such modification includes a change in the method of monitoring (except frequency unless frequency was indicated in the State implementation plan, or subject to any expiration date, other federally enforceable requirements contained in an order, decree, permit, or settlement agreement) that is more stringent than the method of monitoring in effect on September 15, 1992, and that ensures coke oven emission reductions greater than the emission reductions required on September 15, 1992. The burden of proof in demonstrating the stringency of the methods of monitoring is borne by the party requesting the modification and must be made to the satisfaction of the Administrator; or
              
              (iii) Such modification makes the emission limitations more stringent while holding the format unchanged, makes the format more stringent while holding the emission limitations unchanged, or makes both more stringent.
              (2) Any industry application to make a State implementation plan revision or other adjustment to account for differences between Method 303 in appendix A to this part and the State's method based on paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section shall be submitted within 12 months after October 27, 1993.
              (d) Except as specified in § 63.307(f), nothing in this subpart shall limit or affect any authority or obligation of Federal, State, or local agencies to establish emission limitations or other requirements more stringent than those specified in this subpart.
              (e) Except as provided in § 63.302(c), section 112(g) of the Act shall not apply to sources subject to this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.313
              Implementation and enforcement.
              (a) This subpart can be implemented and enforced by the U.S. EPA, or a delegated authority such as the applicable State, local, or Tribal agency. If the U.S. EPA Administrator has delegated authority to a State, local, or Tribal agency, then that agency, in addition to the U.S. EPA, has the authority to implement and enforce this subpart. Contact the applicable U.S. EPA Regional Office to find out if implementation and enforcement of this subpart is delegated to a State, local, or Tribal agency.
              (b) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority of this subpart to a State, local, or Tribal agency under subpart E of this part, the authorities contained in paragraph (d) of this section are retained by the Administrator and cannot be transferred to the State, local, or Tribal agency.
              (c) Withdrawal of authority:
              (1) Whenever the Administrator learns that a delegated agency has not fully carried out the inspections and performance tests required under § 63.309 for each applicable emission point of each battery each day, the Administrator shall immediately notify the agency. Unless the delegated agency demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction within 15 days of notification that the agency is consistently carrying out the inspections and performance tests required under § 63.309 in the manner specified in the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall notify the coke oven battery owner or operator that inspections and performance tests shall be carried out according to § 63.309(a)(5). When the Administrator determines that the delegated agency is prepared to consistently perform all the required inspections and performance tests each day, the Administrator shall give the coke oven battery owner or operator at least 15 days notice that implementation will revert to the previously delegated agency.
              (2) In addition to the provisions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator may also withdraw delegation of authority pursuant to the provisions of § 63.96 of subpart E of this part.
              (d) The authorities that cannot be delegated to State, local, or Tribal agencies are as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) Approval of alternatives to the requirements in §§ 63.300 and 63.302 through 63.308 (except the authorities in 63.306(a)(2) and (d)).
              (2) Approval of major alternatives to test methods under § 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
              (3) Approval of any changes to section 2 of Method 303 in appendix A of this part.
              (4) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring under § 63.8(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
              (5) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting under § 63.10(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.

              § 63.342
              Standards.
              (a)(1) At all times, each owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (2) Each owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with these requirements in this section on and after the compliance dates specified in § 63.343(a). All affected sources are regulated by applying maximum achievable control technology.
              (b) Applicability of emission limitations. (1) The emission limitations in this section apply during tank operation as defined in § 63.341, and during periods of startup and shutdown as these are routine occurrences for affected sources subject to this subpart. In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert a defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (i) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator must timely meet the reporting requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (A) The violation was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (B) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when exceeded violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (C) The frequency, amount and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
              (D) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (E) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (F) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (G) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (H) At all times, the affected sources were operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (I) A written root cause analysis was prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (ii) Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (i) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmation defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.
              (2) If an owner or operator is controlling a group of tanks with a common add-on air pollution control device, the emission limitations of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply whenever any one affected source is operated. The emission limitation that applies to the group of affected sources is:
              (i) The emission limitation identified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section if the affected sources are performing the same type of operation (e.g., hard chromium electroplating), are subject to the same emission limitation, and are not controlled by an add-on air pollution control device also controlling nonaffected sources;
              (ii) The emission limitation calculated according to § 63.344(e)(3) if affected sources are performing the same type of operation, are subject to the same emission limitation, and are controlled with an add-on air pollution control device that is also controlling nonaffected sources; and
              (iii) The emission limitation calculated according to § 63.344(e)(4) if affected sources are performing different types of operations, or affected sources are performing the same operations but subject to different emission limitations, and are controlled with an add-on air pollution control device that may also be controlling emissions from nonaffected sources.

              (5) An owner or operator of an existing hard chromium electroplating tank or tanks located at a small, hard chromium electroplating facility that increases its maximum cumulative potential rectifier capacity, or its actual cumulative rectifier capacity, such that the facility becomes a large, hard chromium electroplating facility must comply with the requirements of § 63.342(c)(1)(i) for all hard chromium electroplating tanks at the facility no later than 1 year after the month in which monthly records required by §§ 63.342(c)(2) and 63.346(b)(12) show that the large designation is met, or by the compliance date specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, whichever is later.
              (6) Request for an extension of compliance. An owner or operator of an affected source or sources that requests an extension of compliance shall do so in accordance with this paragraph and the applicable paragraphs of § 63.6(i). When the owner or operator is requesting the extension for more than one affected source located at the facility, then only one request may be submitted for all affected sources at the facility.
              (i) The owner or operator of an existing affected source who is unable to comply with a relevant standard under this subpart may request that the Administrator (or a State, when the State has an approved part 70 permit program and the source is required to obtain a part 70 permit under that program, or a State, when the State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce the emission standard for that source) grant an extension allowing the owner or operator up to 1 additional year to comply with the standard for the affected source. The owner or operator of an affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph and is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit for the source shall apply for such permit or apply to have the title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph will be incorporated into the owner or operator's title V permit for the affected source(s) according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, whichever is applicable.
              (ii) Any request under this paragraph for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority not later than 6 months before the affected source's compliance date as specified in this section.
              (7) An owner or operator of a decorative chromium electroplating tank that uses a trivalent chromium bath that incorporates a wetting agent, and that ceases using the trivalent chromium process, must comply with the emission limitation now applicable to the tank within 1 year of switching bath operation.

              (ii) A wetting agent is used in the plating or anodizing bath to inhibit chromium emissions from the affected source; and
              
              (iii) The owner or operator complies with the applicable surface tension limit of § 63.342(c)(1)(iii), (c)(2)(iii), or (d)(2) as demonstrated through the continuous compliance monitoring required by paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
              (3) If the affected source is a decorative chromium electroplating tank using a trivalent chromium bath, and the owner or operator is subject to the provisions of § 63.342(e), an initial performance test is not required to be conducted under this subpart.
              (c) Monitoring to demonstrate continuous compliance. The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the emission limitations of this subpart shall conduct monitoring according to the type of air pollution control technique that is used to comply with the emission limitation. The monitoring required to demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations is identified in this section for the air pollution control techniques expected to be used by the owners or operators of affected sources. As an alternative to the daily monitoring, the owner or operator of an affected source may install a continuous pressure monitoring system.
              (1) Composite mesh-pad systems. (i) During the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source, or a group of affected sources under common control, complying with the emission limitations in § 63.342 through the use of a composite mesh-pad system shall determine the outlet chromium concentration using the test methods and procedures in § 63.344(c), and shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter the pressure drop across the system, setting the value that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation, using the procedures in § 63.344(d)(5). An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish a range of compliant pressure drop values, or may set as the compliant value the average pressure drop measured over the three test runs of one performance test and accept ±2 inches of water column from this value as the compliant range.
              (ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, shall monitor and record the pressure drop across the composite mesh-pad system once each day that any affected source is operating. To be in compliance with the standards, the composite mesh-pad system shall be operated within ±2 inches of water column of the pressure drop value established during the initial performance test, or shall be operated within the range of compliant values for pressure drop established during multiple performance tests.
              (iii) The owner or operator of an affected source complying with the emission limitations in § 63.343 through the use of a composite mesh-pad system may repeat the performance test and establish as a new site-specific operating parameter the pressure drop across the composite mesh-pad system according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. To establish a new site-specific operating parameter for pressure drop, the owner or operator shall satisfy the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section.

An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish a range of compliant operating parameter values. Alternatively, the owner or operator may set as the compliant value the average pressure drop and inlet velocity pressure measured over the three test runs of one performance test, and accept ±1 inch of water column from the pressure drop value and ±10 percent from the velocity pressure value as the compliant range.
              (ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, shall monitor and record the velocity pressure at the inlet to the packed-bed system and the pressure drop across the scrubber system once each day that any affected source is operating. To be in compliance with the standards, the scrubber system shall be operated within ±10 percent of the velocity pressure value established during the initial performance test, and within ±1 inch of water column of the pressure drop value established during the initial performance test, or within the range of compliant operating parameter values established during multiple performance tests.

An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish a range of compliant pressure drop values, or may set as the compliant value the average pressure drop measured over the three test runs of one performance test and accept ±1 inch of water column from this value as the compliant range.
              (ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, shall monitor and record the pressure drop across the fiber-bed mist eliminator, and the control device installed upstream of the fiber bed to prevent plugging, once each day that any affected source is operating. To be in compliance with the standards, the fiber-bed mist eliminator and the upstream control device shall be operated within ±1 inch of water column of the pressure drop value established during the initial performance test, or shall be operated within the range of compliant values for pressure drop established during multiple performance tests.
              (5) Wetting agent-type or combination wetting agent-type/foam blanket fume suppressants. (i) During the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source complying with the emission limitations in § 63.342 through the use of a wetting agent in the electroplating or anodizing bath shall determine the outlet chromium concentration using the procedures in § 63.344(c). The owner or operator shall establish as the site-specific operating parameter the surface tension of the bath using Method 306B, appendix A of this part, setting the maximum value that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation. In lieu of establishing the maximum surface tension during the performance test, the owner or operator may accept 40 dynes/cm, as measured by a stalagmometer, or 33 dynes/cm, as measured by a tensiometer, as the maximum surface tension value that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation. However, the owner or operator is exempt from conducting a performance test only if the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met.
              (ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source shall monitor the surface tension of the electroplating or anodizing bath. Operation of the affected source at a surface tension greater than the value established during the performance test, or greater than 40 dynes/cm, as measured by a stalagmometer, or 33 dynes/cm, as measured by a tensiometer, if the owner or operator is using this value in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, shall constitute noncompliance with the standards. The surface tension shall be monitored according to the following schedule:
              (iii) Once a bath solution is drained from the affected tank and a new solution added, the original monitoring schedule of once every 4 hours must be resumed, with a decrease in monitoring frequency allowed following the procedures of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section.
              (6) Foam blanket-type fume suppressants. (i) During the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source complying with the emission limitations in § 63.342 through the use of a foam blanket in the electroplating or anodizing bath shall determine the outlet chromium concentration using the procedures in § 63.344(c), and shall establish as the site-specific operating parameter the thickness of the foam blanket, setting the minimum thickness that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation. In lieu of establishing the minimum foam blanket thickness during the performance test, the owner or operator may accept 2.54 centimeters (1 inch) as the minimum foam blanket thickness that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation. All foam blanket measurements must be taken in close proximity to the workpiece or cathode area in the plating tank(s).
              (ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source shall monitor the foam blanket thickness of the electroplating or anodizing bath. Operation of the affected source at a foam blanket thickness less than the value established during the performance test, or less than 2.54 cm (1 inch) if the owner or operator is using this value in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, shall constitute noncompliance with the standards. The foam blanket thickness shall be measured according to the following schedule:
              (iii) Once a bath solution is drained from the affected tank and a new solution added, the original monitoring schedule of once every hour must be resumed, with a decrease in monitoring frequency allowed following the procedures of paragraphs (c)(6)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section.
              (7) Fume suppressant/add-on control device. (i) If the owner or operator of an affected source uses both a fume suppressant and add-on control device and both are needed to comply with the applicable emission limit, monitoring requirements as identified in paragraphs (c) (1) through (6) of this section, and the work practice standards of Table 1 of § 63.342, apply for each of the control techniques used.
              (ii) If the owner or operator of an affected source uses both a fume suppressant and add-on control device, but only one of these techniques is needed to comply with the applicable emission limit, monitoring requirements as identified in paragraphs (c) (1) through (6) of this section, and work practice standards of Table 1 of § 63.342, apply only for the control technique used to achieve compliance.
              (8) Use of an alternative monitoring method. (i) Requests and approvals of alternative monitoring methods shall be considered in accordance with § 63.8(f)(1), (f)(3), (f)(4), and (f)(5).
              
              (ii) After receipt and consideration of an application for an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring methods or procedures of this subpart including, but not limited to, the following:
              (A) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation or use of monitoring devices specified in this subpart would not provide accurate measurements due to interferences caused by substances within the effluent gases; or
              (B) Alternative locations for installing monitoring devices when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements.
              (d) An owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device not listed in this section shall submit a description of the device, test results collected in accordance with § 63.344(c) verifying the performance of the device for reducing chromium emissions to the atmosphere to the level required by this subpart, a copy of the operation and maintenance plan referenced in § 63.342(f) including operation and maintenance practices, and appropriate operating parameters that will be monitored to establish continuous compliance with the standards. The monitoring plan submitted identifying the continuous compliance monitoring is subject to the Administrator's approval.

              (1) Method 306 or Method 306A, “Determination of Chromium Emissions From Decorative and Hard Chromium Electroplating and Anodizing Operations,” appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the chromium concentration from hard or decorative chromium electroplating tanks or chromium anodizing tanks. The sampling time and sample volume for each run of Methods 306 and 306A, appendix A of this part shall be at least 120 minutes and 1.70 dscm (60 dscf), respectively. Methods 306 and 306A, appendix A of this part allow the measurement of either total chromium or hexavalent chromium emissions. For the purposes of this standard, sources using chromic acid baths must demonstrate compliance with the emission limits of § 63.342 by measuring the total chromium.
              (2) The California Air Resources Board (CARB) Method 425 (which is available by contacting the California Air Resources Board, 1102 Q Street, Sacramento, California 95814) may be used to determine the chromium concentration from hard and decorative chromium electroplating tanks and chromium anodizing tanks if the following conditions are met:
              (i) If a colorimetric analysis method is used, the sampling time and volume shall be sufficient to result in 33 to 66 micrograms of catch in the sampling train.
              (ii) If Atomic Absorption Graphite Furnace (AAGF) or Ion Chromatography with a Post-column Reactor (ICPCR) analyses were used, the sampling time and volume should be sufficient to result in a sample catch that is 5 to 10 times the minimum detection limit of the analytical method (i.e., 1.0 microgram per liter of sample for AAGF and 0.5 microgram per liter of sample for ICPCR).
              (iii) In the case of either paragraph (c)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, a minimum of 3 separate runs must be conducted. The other requirements of § 63.7 that apply to affected sources, as indicated in Table 1 of this subpart, must also be met.
              (3) Method 306B, “Surface Tension Measurement and Recordkeeping for Tanks Used at Decorative Chromium Electroplating and Anodizing Facilities,” appendix A of this part shall be used to measure the surface tension of electroplating and anodizing baths.
              (4) Alternate test methods may also be used if the method has been validated using Method 301, appendix A of this part and if approved by the Administrator. Procedures for requesting and obtaining approval are contained in § 63.7(f).
              (5) The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Method 205.1 (which is available by contacting the South Coast AQMD, 21865 Copley Dr, Diamond Bar, CA 91765) may be used to determine the total chromium concentration from hard and decorative chromium electroplating tanks and chromium anodizing tanks.
              (d) Establishing site-specific operating parameter values. (1) Each owner or operator required to establish site-specific operating parameters shall follow the procedures in this section.
              (2) All monitoring equipment shall be installed such that representative measurements of emissions or process parameters from the affected source are obtained. For monitoring equipment purchased from a vendor, verification of the operational status of the monitoring equipment shall include execution of the manufacturer's written specifications or recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the system.
              (i) Specifications for differential pressure measurement devices used to measure velocity pressure shall be in accordance with section 2.2 of Method 2 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A).

              (ii) Specification for differential pressure measurement devices used to measure pressure drop across a control system shall be in accordance with manufacturer's accuracy specifications.
              (3) The surface tension of electroplating and anodizing baths shall be measured using Method 306B, “Surface Tension Measurement and Recordkeeping for Tanks used at Decorative Chromium Electroplating and Anodizing Facilities,” appendix A of this part. This method should also be followed when wetting agent type or combination wetting agent/foam blanket type fume suppressants are used to control chromium emissions from a hard chromium electroplating tank and surface tension measurement is conducted to demonstrate continuous compliance.
              (4) The owner or operator of a source required to measure the velocity pressure at the inlet to an add-on air pollution control device in accordance with § 63.343(c)(2), shall establish the site-specific velocity pressure as follows:
              (i) Locate a velocity traverse port in a section of straight duct that connects the hooding on the plating tank or tanks with the control device. The port shall be located as close to the control system as possible, and shall be placed a minimum of 2 duct diameters downstream and 0.5 diameter upstream of any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, or contraction (see Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). If 2.5 diameters of straight duct work does not exist, locate the port 0.8 of the duct diameter downstream and 0.2 of the duct diameter upstream from any flow disturbance.
              (ii) A 12-point velocity traverse of the duct to the control device shall be conducted along a single axis according to Method 2 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) using an S-type pitot tube; measurement of the barometric pressure and duct temperature at each traverse point is not required, but is suggested. Mark the S-type pitot tube as specified in Method 1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) with 12 points. Measure the velocity pressure (Δ p) values for the velocity points and record. Determine the square root of the individual velocity point Δ p values and average. The point with the square root value that comes closest to the average square root value is the point of average velocity. The Δ p value measured for this point during the performance test will be used as the reference for future monitoring.
              (5) The owner or operator of a source required to measure the pressure drop across the add-on air pollution control device in accordance with § 63.343(c) (1) through (4) may establish the pressure drop in accordance with the following guidelines:
              (i) Pressure taps shall be installed at any of the following locations:
              (A) At the inlet and outlet of the control system. The inlet tap should be installed in the ductwork just prior to the control device and the corresponding outlet pressure tap should be installed on the outlet side of the control device prior to the blower or on the downstream side of the blower;
              (B) On each side of the packed bed within the control system or on each side of each mesh pad within the control system; or
              (C) On the front side of the first mesh pad and back side of the last mesh pad within the control system.
              (ii) Pressure taps shall be sited at locations that are:
              (A) Free from pluggage as possible and away from any flow disturbances such as cyclonic demisters.
              (B) Situated such that no air infiltration at measurement site will occur that could bias the measurement.
              (iii) Pressure taps shall be constructed of either polyethylene, polybutylene, or other nonreactive materials.
              (iv) Nonreactive plastic tubing shall be used to connect the pressure taps to the device used to measure pressure drop.
              (v) Any of the following pressure gauges can be used to monitor pressure drop: a magnehelic gauge, an inclined manometer, or a “U” tube manometer.
              (vi) Prior to connecting any pressure lines to the pressure gauge(s), each gauge should be zeroed. No calibration of the pressure gauges is required.
              (e) Special compliance provisions for multiple sources controlled by a common add-on air pollution control device. (1) This section identifies procedures for measuring the outlet chromium concentration from an add-on air pollution control device that is used to control multiple sources that may or may not include sources not affected by this subpart.
              (2) When multiple affected sources performing the same type of operation (e.g., all are performing hard chromium electroplating), and subject to the same emission limitation, are controlled with an add-on air pollution control device that is not controlling emissions from any other type of affected operation or from any nonaffected sources, the applicable emission limitation identified in § 63.342 must be met at the outlet of the add-on air pollution control device.
              (3) When multiple affected sources performing the same type of operation and subject to the same emission limitation are controlled with a common add-on air pollution control device that is also controlling emissions from sources not affected by these standards, the following procedures should be followed to determine compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 63.342:
              (i) Calculate the cross-sectional area of each inlet duct (i.e., uptakes from each hood) including those not affected by the standard.
              (ii) Determine the total sample time per test run by dividing the total inlet area from all tanks connected to the control system by the total inlet area for all ducts associated with affected sources, and then multiply this number by 2 hours. The calculated time is the minimum sample time required per test run.
              (iii) Perform Method 306 or 306A testing and calculate an outlet mass emission rate.

              (iv) Determine the total ventilation rate from the affected sources (VRinlet) by using equation 1:
              
                ER19SE12.000
              
              
                where VRtot is the average total ventilation rate in dscm/min for the three test runs as determined at the outlet by means of the Method 306 or 306A testing; IDAi is the total inlet area for all ducts associated with affected sources; ∑IAtotal is the sum of all inlet duct areas from both affected and nonaffected sources; and VRinlet is the total ventilation rate from all inlet ducts associated with affected sources.
              
              

              (v) Establish the allowable mass emission rate of the system (AMRsys) in milligrams of total chromium per hour (mg/hr) using equation 2:
              
                ER19SE12.001
              
              
                where Σ VRinlet is the total ventilation rate in dscm/min from the affected sources, and EL is the applicable emission limitation from § 63.342 in mg/dscm. The allowable mass emission rate (AMRsys) calculated from equation 2 should be equal to or more than the outlet three-run average mass emission rate determined from Method 306 or 306A testing in order for the source to be in compliance with the standard.
              
              
              (4) When multiple affected sources performing different types of operations (e.g., hard chromium electroplating, decorative chromium electroplating, or chromium anodizing) are controlled by a common add-on air pollution control device that may or may not also be controlling emissions from sources not affected by these standards, or if the affected sources controlled by the common add-on air pollution control device perform the same operation but are subject to different emission limitations (e.g., because one is a new hard chromium plating tank and one is an existing small, hard chromium plating tank), the following procedures should be followed to determine compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 63.342:

              (i) Follow the steps outlined in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
              

              (ii) Determine the total ventilation rate for each type of affected source (VRinlet,a) using equation 3:
              
                ER19SE12.002
              
              
                where VRtot is the average total ventilation rate in dscm/min for the three test runs as determined at the outlet by means of the Method 306 or 306A testing; IDAi,a is the total inlet duct area for all ducts conveying chromic acid from each type of affected source performing the same operation, or each type of affected source subject to the same emission limitation; ∑IAtotal is the sum of all duct areas from both affected and nonaffected sources; and VRinlet,a is the total ventilation rate from all inlet ducts conveying chromic acid from each type of affected source performing the same operation, or each type of affected source subject to the same emission limitation.
              
              

              (iii) Establish the allowable mass emission rate in mg/hr for each type of affected source that is controlled by the add-on air pollution control device using equation 4, 5, 6, or 7 as appropriate:
              
              VRhc1 × ELhc1 × 60 minutes/hour = AMRhc1  (4)
              
              VRhc2 × ELhc2 × 60 minutes/hour = AMRhc2  (5)
              
              VRdc × ELdc × 60  minutes/hour = AMRdc  (6)
              
              VRca × ELca × 60  minutes/hour = AMRca  (7)
              
              
                where “hc” applies to the total of ventilation rates for all hard chromium electroplating tanks subject to the same emission limitation, “dc” applies to the total of ventilation rates for the decorative chromium electroplating tanks, “ca” applies to the total of ventilation rates for the chromium anodizing tanks, and EL is the applicable emission limitation from § 63.342 in mg/dscm. There are two equations for hard chromium electroplating tanks because different emission limitations may apply (e.g., a new tank versus an existing, small tank).
              

              (iv) Establish the allowable mass emission rate of the system (AMRsys) in milligrams of total chromium per hour (mg/hr) using equation 8, including each type of affected source as appropriate:
              
                ER19SE12.003
              
              The allowable mass emission rate calculated from equation 8 should be equal to or more than the outlet three-run average mass emission rate determined from Method 306 or 306A testing in order for the source to be in compliance with the standards.
              (5) Each owner or operator that uses the special compliance provisions of this paragraph to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations of § 63.342 shall submit the measurements and calculations to support these compliance methods with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.347(e).
              (6) Each owner or operator that uses the special compliance provisions of this section to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations of § 63.342 shall repeat these procedures if a tank is added or removed from the control system regardless of whether that tank is a nonaffected source. If the new nonaffected tank replaces an existing nonaffected tank of the same size and is connected to the control system through the same size inlet duct then this procedure does not have to be repeated.
              (f) Compliance provisions for the mass rate emission standard for enclosed hard chromium electroplating tanks. (1) This section identifies procedures for calculating the maximum allowable mass emission rate for owners or operators of affected sources who choose to meet the mass emission rate standard in § 63.342(c)(2)(iv) or (v).
              (i)(A) The owner or operator of an enclosed hard chromium electroplating tank that is an existing affected source and is located at a large hard chromium electroplating facility who chooses to meet the mass emission rate standard in § 63.342(c)(2)(iv) shall determine compliance by not allowing the mass rate of total chromium in the exhaust gas stream discharged to the atmosphere to exceed the maximum allowable mass emission rate calculated using equation 9:
              
                ER19SE12.004
              
              (B) Compliance with the alternative mass emission limit is demonstrated if the three-run average mass emission rate determined from Method 306 testing is less than or equal to the maximum allowable mass emission rate calculated from equation 9.
              (ii)(A) The owner or operator of an enclosed hard chromium electroplating tank that is an existing affected source located at a small hard chromium electroplating facility who chooses to meet the mass emission rate standard in § 63.342(c)(2)(v) shall determine compliance by not allowing the mass rate of total chromium in the exhaust gas stream discharged to the atmosphere to exceed the maximum allowable mass emission rate calculated using equation 10:
              
                ER19SE12.005
              
              (B) Compliance with the alternative mass emission limit is demonstrated if the three-run average mass emission rate determined from testing using Method 306 of appendix A to part 63 is less than or equal to the maximum allowable mass emission rate calculated from equation 10.
              (iii)(A) The owner or operator of an enclosed hard chromium electroplating tank that is a new source who chooses to meet the mass emission rate standard in § 63.342(c)(2)(vii) shall determine compliance by not allowing the mass rate of total chromium in the exhaust gas stream discharged to the atmosphere to exceed the maximum allowable mass emission rate calculated using equation 11:
              
                ER19SE12.006
              
              (B) Compliance with the alternative mass emission limit is demonstrated if the three-run average mass emission rate determined from testing using Method 306 or 306A of appendix A to part 63 is less than or equal to the maximum allowable mass emission rate calculated from equation 11.

The discussion shall be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the technical or economic limitations affect the source's ability to comply with the relevant standard and how they do so.
              (vi) If in the notification of reconstruction, the owner or operator designates the affected source as a reconstructed source and declares that there are no economic or technical limitations to prevent the source from complying with all relevant standards or requirements, the owner or operator need not submit the information required in paragraphs (b)(3) (iii) through (v) of this section.
              (4) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source that submits a notification in accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section is not subject to approval by the Administrator. Construction or reconstruction is subject only to notification and can begin upon submission of a complete notification.
              (5) Submittal timeframes. After January 25, 1995, whether or not an approved permit program is effective in the State in which an affected source is (or would be) located, an owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source shall submit the notification of construction or reconstruction required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section according to the following schedule:
              (i) If construction or reconstruction commences after January 25, 1995, the notification shall be submitted as soon as practicable before the construction or reconstruction is planned to commence.
              (ii) If the construction or reconstruction had commenced and initial startup had not occurred before January 25, 1995, the notification shall be submitted as soon as practicable before startup but no later than 60 days after January 25, 1995.

              (3) For sources required to conduct a performance test by § 63.343(b), the notification of compliance status shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than 90 calendar days following completion of the compliance demonstration required by § 63.7 and § 63.343(b).
              (4) For sources that are not required to complete a performance test in accordance with § 63.343(b), the notification of compliance status shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than 30 days after the compliance date specified in § 63.343(a), except the date on which sources in California shall monitor the surface tension of the anodizing bath is extended to January 25, 1998.
              (f) Reports of performance test results. (1) If the State in which the source is located has not been delegated the authority to implement the rule, the owner or operator of an affected source shall report to the Administrator the results of any performance test conducted as required by § 63.7 or § 63.343(b). If the State has been delegated the authority, the owner or operator of an affected source should report performance test results to the appropriate authority.
              (2) Reports of performance test results shall be submitted no later than 90 days following the completion of the performance test, and shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required by paragraph (e) of this section.

              (3)(i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (defined in § 63.2) as required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, required by this subpart to the EPA's WebFIRE database by using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) that is accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (www.epa.gov/cdx). Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated through use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html). Only data collected using test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. At the discretion of the delegated authority, you must also submit these reports, including the confidential business information, to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority. For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator shall submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.
              (g) Ongoing compliance status reports for major sources. (1) The owner or operator of an affected source that is located at a major source site shall submit a summary report to the Administrator to document the ongoing compliance status of the affected source. The report shall contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, and shall be submitted semiannually except when:
              (i) The Administrator determines on a case-by-case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source; or
              (ii) The monitoring data collected by the owner or operator of the affected source in accordance with § 63.343(c) show that the emission limit has been exceeded, in which case quarterly reports shall be submitted. Once an owner or operator of an affected source reports an exceedance, ongoing compliance status reports shall be submitted quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is approved.
              (2) Request to reduce frequency of ongoing compliance status reports. (i) An owner or operator who is required to submit ongoing compliance status reports on a quarterly (or more frequent basis) may reduce the frequency of reporting to semiannual if all of the following conditions are met:
              (A) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods), the ongoing compliance status reports demonstrate that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant emission limit;
              (B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all applicable recordkeeping and monitoring requirements of subpart A of this part and this subpart; and
              (C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced reporting frequency for the affected source, as provided in paragraphs (g)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
              (ii) The frequency of submitting ongoing compliance status reports may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change, and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced reporting frequency, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, or the recordkeeping period since the source's compliance date, whichever is shorter. Records subject to review may include performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with emission limitations and work practice standards. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce reporting frequency, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.
              (iii) As soon as the monitoring data required by § 63.343(c) show that the source is not in compliance with the relevant emission limit, the frequency of reporting shall revert to quarterly, and the owner shall state this exceedance in the ongoing compliance status report for the next reporting period. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant emission limit for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the reporting frequency as allowed by paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
              (3) Contents of ongoing compliance status reports. The owner or operator of an affected source for which compliance monitoring is required in accordance with § 63.343(c) shall prepare a summary report to document the ongoing compliance status of the source. The report must contain the following information:
              (i) The company name and address of the affected source;
              (ii) An identification of the operating parameter that is monitored for compliance determination, as required by § 63.343(c);
              (iii) The relevant emission limitation for the affected source, and the operating parameter value, or range of values, that correspond to compliance with this emission limitation as specified in the notification of compliance status required by paragraph (e) of this section;
              (iv) The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;
              (v) A description of the type of process performed in the affected source;

              (ix) A certification by a responsible official, as defined in § 63.2, that the work practice standards in § 63.342(f) were followed in accordance with the operation and maintenance plan for the source;
              (x) If the operation and maintenance plan required by § 63.342(f)(3) was not followed, an explanation of the reasons for not following the provisions, an assessment of whether any excess emission and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred, and a copy of the report(s) required by § 63.342(f)(3)(iv) documenting that the operation and maintenance plan was not followed;
              (xi) A description of any changes in monitoring, processes, or controls since the last reporting period;
              (xii) The number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. The report must also include a description of actions taken by an owner or operator during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.342(a)(1), including actions taken to correct a malfunction.
              (xiii) The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report; and
              (xiv) The date of the report.
              (4) When more than one monitoring device is used to comply with the continuous compliance monitoring required by § 63.343(c), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each monitoring device. However, when one monitoring device is used as a backup for the primary monitoring device, the owner or operator shall only report the results from the monitoring device used to meet the monitoring requirements of this subpart. If both devices are used to meet these requirements, then the owner or operator shall report the results from each monitoring device for the relevant compliance period.
              (h) Ongoing compliance status reports for area sources. The requirements of this paragraph do not alleviate affected area sources from complying with the requirements of State or Federal operating permit programs under 40 CFR part 71.
              (1) The owner or operator of an affected source that is located at an area source site shall prepare a summary report to document the ongoing compliance status of the affected source. The report shall contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, shall be completed annually and retained on site, and made available to the Administrator upon request. The report shall be completed annually except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
              (2) Reports of exceedances. (i) If either of the following conditions is met, semiannual reports shall be prepared and submitted to the Administrator:
              (A) The total duration of excess emissions (as indicated by the monitoring data collected by the owner or operator of the affected source in accordance with § 63.343(c)) is 1 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period; or
              (B) The total duration of malfunctions of the add-on air pollution control device and monitoring equipment is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time.
              (ii) Once an owner or operator of an affected source reports an exceedance as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, ongoing compliance status reports shall be submitted semiannually until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph (h)(3) of this section is approved.
              (iii) The Administrator may determine on a case-by-case basis that the summary report shall be completed more frequently and submitted, or that the annual report shall be submitted instead of being retained on site, if these measures are necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source.
              (3) Request to reduce frequency of ongoing compliance status reports. (i) An owner or operator who is required to submit ongoing compliance status reports on a semiannual (or more frequent) basis, or is required to submit its annual report instead of retaining it on site, may reduce the frequency of reporting to annual and/or be allowed to maintain the annual report onsite if all of the following conditions are met:
              (A) For 1 full year (e.g., 2 semiannual or 4 quarterly reporting periods), the ongoing compliance status reports demonstrate that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant emission limit;
              (B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all applicable recordkeeping and monitoring requirements of subpart A of this part and this subpart; and
              (C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced reporting frequency for the affected source, as provided in paragraphs (h)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
              (ii) The frequency of submitting ongoing compliance status reports may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change, and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced reporting frequency, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, or the recordkeeping period since the source's compliance date, whichever is shorter. Records subject to review may include performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with emission limitations and work practice standards. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgement about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce reporting frequency, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.
              (iii) As soon as the monitoring data required by § 63.343(c) show that the source is not in compliance with the relevant emission limit, the frequency of reporting shall revert to semiannual, and the owner shall state this exceedance in the ongoing compliance status report for the next reporting period. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant emission limit for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the reporting frequency as allowed by paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
              (i) Reports associated with trivalent chromium baths. The requirements of this paragraph do not alleviate affected sources from complying with the requirements of State or Federal operating permit programs under title V. Owners or operators complying with the provisions of § 63.342(e) are not subject to paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, but must instead submit the following reports:
              (1) Within 180 days after January 25, 1995, submit an initial notification that includes:
              (i) The same information as is required by paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (v) of this section; and

              (2) In addition to the procedures in Method 21, include the following procedures:
              (i) Perform the test on each compartment during loading of that compartment or while the compartment is still under pressure.
              (ii) To eliminate a positive instrument drift, the dwell time for each leak detection shall not exceed two times the instrument response time. Purge the instrument with ambient air between each leak detection. The duration of the purge shall be in excess of two instrument response times.
              (iii) Attempt to block the wind from the area being monitored. Record the highest detector reading and location for each leak.
              (g) Nitrogen pressure decay field test. For those cargo tanks with manifolded product lines, this test procedure shall be conducted on each compartment.

              (1) Record the cargo tank capacity. Upon completion of the loading operation, record the total volume loaded. Seal the cargo tank vapor collection system at the vapor coupler. The sealing apparatus shall have a pressure tap. Open the internal vapor valve(s) of the cargo tank and record the initial headspace pressure. Reduce or increase, as necessary, the initial headspace pressure to 460 mm H2 O (18.0 in. H2 O), gauge by releasing pressure or by adding commercial grade nitrogen gas from a high pressure cylinder capable of maintaining a pressure of 2,000 psig.

              (i) The cylinder shall be equipped with a compatible two-stage regulator with a relief valve and a flow control metering valve. The flow rate of the nitrogen shall be no less than 2 cfm. The maximum allowable time to pressurize cargo tanks with headspace volumes of 1,000 gallons or less to the appropriate pressure is 4 minutes. For cargo tanks with a headspace of greater than 1,000 gallons, use as a maximum allowable time to pressurize 4 minutes or the result from the equation below, whichever is greater.
              
              T = Vh × 0.004
              
              
                where:
                
                T = maximum allowable time to pressurize the cargo tank, min;
                Vh = cargo tank headspace volume during testing, gal.
              
              
              

              (2) It is recommended that after the cargo tank headspace pressure reaches approximately 460 mm H2 O (18 in. H20), gauge, a fine adjust valve be used to adjust the headspace pressure to 460 mm H2 O (18.0 in. H2 O), gauge for the next 30 ±5 seconds.

              (3) Reseal the cargo tank vapor collection system and record the headspace pressure after 1 minute. The measured headspace pressure after 1 minute shall be greater than the minimum allowable final headspace pressure (PF) as calculated from the following equation:
              
                ER26JN95.000
              
              
                where:
                
                (PF) = minimum allowable final headspace pressure, in. H2 O, gauge;
                Vs = total cargo tank shell capacity, gal;
                Vh = cargo tank headspace volume after loading, gal;
                18.0 = initial pressure at start of test, in. H2 O, gauge;

                N = 5-minute continuous performance standard at any time from the third column of Table 2 of § 63.425(e)(i), inches H2 O.
              
              

              (4) Conduct the internal vapor valve portion of this test by repressurizing the cargo tank headspace with nitrogen to 460 mm H2 O (18 in. H2 O), gauge. Close the internal vapor valve(s), wait for 30 ±5 seconds, then relieve the pressure downstream of the vapor valve in the vapor collection system to atmospheric pressure. Wait 15 seconds, then reseal the vapor collection system. Measure and record the pressure every minute for 5 minutes. Within 5 seconds of the pressure measurement at the end of 5 minutes, open the vapor valve and record the headspace pressure as the “final pressure.”
              (5) If the decrease in pressure in the vapor collection system is less than at least one of the interval pressure change values in Table 3 of this paragraph, or if the final pressure is equal to or greater than 20 percent of the 1-minute final headspace pressure determined in the test in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, then the cargo tank is considered to be a vapor-tight gasoline cargo tank.

Conduct only the positive pressure test using a time period (t) of 5 minutes. The initial pressure (Pi) shall be 460 mm H2 O (18 in. H2 O), gauge. The maximum allowable 5-minute pressure change (Δ p) which shall be met at any time is shown in the third column of Table 2 of § 63.425(e)(1).
              (i) Railcar bubble leak test procedures. As an alternative to paragraph (e) of this section for annual certification leakage testing of gasoline cargo tanks, the owner or operator may comply with paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section for railcar gasoline cargo tanks, provided the railcar tank meets the requirement in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
              (1) Comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 173.31(d), 179.7, 180.509, and 180.511 for the testing of railcar gasoline cargo tanks.
              (2) The leakage pressure test procedure required under 49 CFR 180.509(j) and used to show no indication of leakage under 49 CFR 180.511(f) shall be ASTM E 515-95 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), BS EN 1593:1999 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or another bubble leak test procedure meeting the requirements in 49 CFR 179.7, 180.505, and 180.509.

              (3) The alternative requirements in this paragraph (i) may not be used for any railcar gasoline cargo tank that collects gasoline vapors from a vapor balance system permitted under or required by a Federal, State, local, or tribal agency. A vapor balance system is a piping and collection system designed to collect gasoline vapors displaced from a storage vessel, barge, or other container being loaded, and routes the displaced gasoline vapors into the railcar gasoline cargo tank from which liquid gasoline is being unloaded.

The storage requirement is needed since the soluble BOD5 test requires 5 days or more to obtain results. If the results of the soluble BOD5 test are outside of the range established during the initial performance test, then the archive sample shall be used to perform the mass removal or percent reduction determinations.
              (2) As an alternative to the monitoring requirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, conduct daily monitoring of the site-specific parameters established according to the procedures specified in paragraph (n) of this section.

              (ii) The remaining quarterly performance tests shall be performed as specified in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section except owners or operators may use the applicable methanol procedure in § 63.457(l)(1) or (2) and the value of r determined during the first quarter test instead of measuring the additional HAP to determine a new value of r.
              (k) Each enclosure and closed-vent system used to comply with § 63.450(a) shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(6) of this section.
              (1) For each enclosure opening, a visual inspection of the closure mechanism specified in § 63.450(b) shall be performed at least once every 30 days to ensure the opening is maintained in the closed position and sealed.
              (2) Each closed-vent system required by § 63.450(a) shall be visually inspected every 30 days and at other times as requested by the Administrator. The visual inspection shall include inspection of ductwork, piping, enclosures, and connections to covers for visible evidence of defects.
              (3) For positive pressure closed-vent systems or portions of closed-vent systems, demonstrate no detectable leaks as specified in § 63.450(c) measured initially and annually by the procedures in § 63.457(d).
              (4) Demonstrate initially and annually that each enclosure opening is maintained at negative pressure as specified in § 63.457(e).
              (5) The valve or closure mechanism specified in § 63.450(d)(2) shall be inspected at least once every 30 days to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the emission point gas stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
              (6) If an inspection required by paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(5) of this section identifies visible defects in ductwork, piping, enclosures or connections to covers required by § 63.450, or if an instrument reading of 500 parts per million by volume or greater above background is measured, or if enclosure openings are not maintained at negative pressure, then the following corrective actions shall be taken as soon as practicable.
              (i) A first effort to repair or correct the closed-vent system shall be made as soon as practicable but no later than 5 calendar days after the problem is identified.
              (ii) The repair or corrective action shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the problem is identified. Delay of repair or corrective action is allowed if the repair or corrective action is technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown or if the owner or operator determines that the emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment shall be completed by the end of the next process unit shutdown.
              (l) Each pulping process condensate closed collection system used to comply with § 63.446(d) shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(3) of this section.
              (1) Each pulping process condensate closed collection system shall be visually inspected every 30 days and shall comply with the inspection and monitoring requirements specified in § 63.964 of subpart RR of this part, except:
              (i) Owners or operators shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements of § 63.454 instead of the requirements specified in § 63.964(a)(1)(vi) and (b)(3) of subpart RR of this part.
              (ii) Owners or operators shall comply with the inspection and monitoring requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices specified in paragraphs (a) and (k) of this section instead of the requirements specified in § 63.964(a)(2) of subpart RR of this part.
              (2) Each condensate tank used in the closed collection system shall be operated with no detectable leaks as specified in § 63.446(d)(2)(i) measured initially and annually by the procedures specified in § 63.457(d).

              (3) If an inspection required by this section identifies visible defects in the closed collection system, or if an instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater above background is measured, then corrective actions specified in § 63.964(b) of subpart RR of this part shall be taken.
              (m) Each owner or operator using a control device, technique or an alternative parameter other than those specified in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section shall install a CMS and establish appropriate operating parameters to be monitored that demonstrate, to the Administrator's satisfaction, continuous compliance with the applicable control requirements.
              (n) To establish or reestablish the value for each operating parameter required to be monitored under paragraphs (b) through (j), (l), and (m) of this section or to establish appropriate parameters for paragraphs (f), (i), (j)(2), and (m) of this section, each owner or operator shall use the following procedures:
              (1) During the initial performance test required in § 63.457(a) or any subsequent performance test, continuously record the operating parameter;

Include all data and calculations used to develop the value and a description of why the value, monitoring frequency, and averaging time demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission standard.
              (o) Each owner or operator of a control device subject to the monitoring provisions of this section shall operate the control device in a manner consistent with the minimum or maximum (as appropriate) operating parameter value or procedure required to be monitored under paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section and established under this subpart. Except as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, § 63.443(e), or § 63.446(g), operation of the control device below minimum operating parameter values or above maximum operating parameter values established under this subpart or failure to perform procedures required by this subpart shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission standard of this subpart and be reported as a period of excess emissions.
              (p) The procedures of this paragraph apply to each owner or operator of an open biological treatment system complying with paragraph (j) of this section whenever a monitoring parameter excursion occurs, and the owner or operator chooses to conduct a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit. A monitoring parameter excursion occurs whenever the monitoring parameters specified in paragraphs (j)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section or any of the monitoring parameters specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section are below minimum operating parameter values or above maximum operating parameter values established in paragraph (n) of this section.
              (1) As soon as practical after the beginning of the monitoring parameter excursion, the following requirements shall be met:
              (i) Before the steps in paragraph (p)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section are performed, all sampling and measurements necessary to meet the requirements in paragraph (p)(2) of this section shall be conducted.
              (ii) Steps shall be taken to repair or adjust the operation of the process to end the parameter excursion period.
              (iii) Steps shall be taken to minimize total HAP emissions to the atmosphere during the parameter excursion period.
              (2) A parameter excursion is not a violation of the applicable emission standard if the results of the performance test conducted using the procedures in this paragraph demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.446(e)(2).

              (i) Conduct a performance test as specified in § 63.457 using the monitoring data specified in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section that coincides with the time of the parameter excursion. No maintenance or changes shall be made to the open biological treatment system after the beginning of a parameter excursion that would influence the results of the performance test.
              (ii) If the results of the performance test specified in paragraph (p)(2)(i) of this section demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.446(e)(2), then the parameter excursion is not a violation of the applicable emission limit.
              (iii) If the results of the performance test specified in paragraph (p)(2)(i) of this section do not demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.446(e)(2) because the total HAP mass entering the open biological treatment system is below the level needed to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.446(e)(2), then the owner or operator shall perform the following comparisons:
              (A) If the value of fbio (MeOH) determined during the performance test specified in paragraph (p)(2)(i) of this section is within the range of values established during the initial and subsequent performance tests approved by the Administrator, then the parameter excursion is not a violation of the applicable standard.
              (B) If the value of fbio (MeOH) determined during the performance test specified in paragraph (p)(2)(i) of this section is not within the range of values established during the initial and subsequent performance tests approved by the Administrator, then the parameter excursion is a violation of the applicable standard.
              (iv) The results of the performance test specified in paragraph (p)(2)(i) of this section shall be recorded as specified in § 63.454(f).
              (3) If an owner or operator determines that performing the required procedures under paragraph (p)(2) of this section for a nonthoroughly mixed open biological system would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions, all of the following procedures shall be performed:

              (i) Calculate the mass removal or percent reduction value using the procedures specified in § 63.457(l) except the value for fbio (MeOH) shall be determined using the procedures in appendix E to this part.
              (ii) Repeat the procedures in paragraph (p)(3)(i) of this section for every day until the unsafe conditions have passed.

              (iii) A parameter excursion is a violation of the standard if the percent reduction or mass removal determined in paragraph (p)(3)(i) of this section is less than the percent reduction or mass removal standards specified in § 63.446(e)(2), as appropriate, unless the value of fbio (MeOH) determined using the procedures in appendix E of this section, as specified in paragraph (p)(3)(i), is within the range of fbio (MeOH) values established during the initial and subsequent performance tests previously approved by the Administrator.
              (iv) The determination that there is a condition that exposes a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions shall be documented according to requirements in § 63.454(e) and reporting in § 63.455(f).
              (v) The requirements of paragraphs (p)(1) and (2) of this section shall be performed and met as soon as practical but no later than 24 hours after the conditions have passed that exposed a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions.
              (q) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated through use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html). Only data collected using test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. At the discretion of the delegated authority, the owner or operator must also submit these reports, including the CBI, to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority. For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.
              (3) Within 60 days after the date of completing each CEMS performance evaluation test as defined in § 63.2, the owner or operator must submit relative accuracy test audit (RATA) data to the EPA's CDX by using CEDRI in accordance with paragraph (2) of this section. Only RATA pollutants that can be documented with the ERT (as listed on the ERT Web site) are subject to this requirement. For any performance evaluations with no corresponding RATA pollutants listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.

              (4) All reports required by this subpart not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section must be sent to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13. The Administrator or the delegated authority may request a report in any form suitable for the specific case (e.g., by commonly used electronic media such as Excel spreadsheet, on CD or hard copy). The Administrator retains the right to require submittal of reports subject to paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section in paper format

              § 63.456
              Affirmative defense for violation of emission standards during malfunction.
              In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in §§ 63.443(c) and (d), 63.444(b) and (c), 63.445(b) and (c), 63.446(c), (d), and (e), 63.447(b) or § 63.450(d), the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (a) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (1) The violation:
              (i) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner, and
              (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (iv) Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
              (4) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment and human health; and
              (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (7) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (8) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (b) Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.

              § 63.457
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Performance tests. Initial and repeat performance tests are required for the emissions sources specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, except for emission sources controlled by a combustion device that is designed and operated as specified in § 63.443(d)(3) or (4).
              (1) Conduct an initial performance test for all emission sources subject to the limitations in §§ 63.443, 63.444, 63.445, 63.446, and 63.447.
              (2) Conduct repeat performance tests at five-year intervals for all emission sources subject to the limitations in §§ 63.443, 63.444, and 63.445. The first of the 5-year repeat tests must be conducted by September 7, 2015, and thereafter within 60 months from the date of the previous performance test. Five-year repeat testing is not required for the following:
              (i) Knotter or screen systems with HAP emission rates below the criteria specified in § 63.443(a)(1)(ii).
              (ii) Decker systems using fresh water or paper machine white water, or decker systems using process water with a total HAP concentration less than 400 parts per million by weight as specified in § 63.443(a)(1)(iv).
              (b) Vent sampling port locations and gas stream properties. For purposes of selecting vent sampling port locations and determining vent gas stream properties, required in §§ 63.443, 63.444, 63.445, and 63.447, each owner or operator shall comply with the applicable procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.
              (1) Method 1 or 1A of part 60, appendix A-1, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site as follows:
              (i) To sample for vent gas concentrations and volumetric flow rates, the sampling site shall be located prior to dilution of the vent gas stream and prior to release to the atmosphere;
              (ii) For determining compliance with percent reduction requirements, sampling sites shall be located prior to the inlet of the control device and at the outlet of the control device; measurements shall be performed simultaneously at the two sampling sites; and
              (iii) For determining compliance with concentration limits or mass emission rate limits, the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the control device.
              (2) No traverse site selection method is needed for vents smaller than 0.10 meter (4.0 inches) in diameter.
              (3) The vent gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of part 60, appendix A-1, as appropriate.
              (4) The moisture content of the vent gas shall be measured using Method 4 of part 60, appendix A-3.
              (5) To determine vent gas concentrations, the owner or operator shall conduct a minimum of three test runs that are representative of normal conditions and average the resulting pollutant concentrations using the following procedures.
              (i) Method 308 in Appendix A of this part; Method 320 in Appendix A of this part; Method 18 in appendix A-6 of part 60; ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004) (incorporated by reference in § 63.14(b)(28) of subpart A of this part); or ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference in § 63.14(b)(54) of subpart A of this part) shall be used to determine the methanol concentration. If ASTM D6348-03 is used, the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) though (b)(5)(i)(B) must be met.
              (A) The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D6348-03, sections A1 through A8 are required.

              (B) In ASTM D6348-03 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5 of ASTM D6348-03). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be between 70 and 130 percent. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte following adjustment of the sampling or analytical procedure before the retest. The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound using the following equation: Reported Result = Measured Concentration in the Stack × 100)/%R.
              (ii) Except for the modifications specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A) through (b)(5)(ii)(K) of this section, Method 26A of part 60, appendix A-8 shall be used to determine chlorine concentration in the vent stream.
              (A) Probe/sampling line. A separate probe is not required. The sampling line shall be an appropriate length of 0.64 cm (0.25 in) OD Teflon ® tubing. The sample inlet end of the sampling line shall be inserted into the stack in such a way as to not entrain liquid condensation from the vent gases. The other end shall be connected to the impingers. The length of the tubing may vary from one sampling site to another, but shall be as short as possible in each situation. If sampling is conducted in sunlight, opaque tubing shall be used. Alternatively, if transparent tubing is used, it shall be covered with opaque tape.
              (B) Impinger train. Three 30 milliliter (ml) capacity midget impingers shall be connected in series to the sampling line. The impingers shall have regular tapered stems. Silica gel shall be placed in the third impinger as a desiccant. All impinger train connectors shall be glass and/or Teflon ®.
              (C) Critical orifice. The critical orifice shall have a flow rate of 200 to 250 ml/min and shall be followed by a vacuum pump capable of providing a vacuum of 640 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). A 45 millimeter diameter in-line Teflon 0.8 micrometer filter shall follow the impingers to protect the critical orifice and vacuum pump.
              (D) The following are necessary for the analysis apparatus:
              (1) Wash bottle filled with deionized water;
              (2) 25 or 50 ml graduated burette and stand;
              (3) Magnetic stirring apparatus and stir bar;
              (4) Calibrated pH Meter;
              (5) 150-250 ml beaker or flask; and
              (6) A 5 ml pipette.

              (E) The procedures listed in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(E)(1) through (b)(5)(ii)(E)(7) of this section shall be used to prepare the reagents.
              (1) To prepare the 1 molarity (M) potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution, dissolve 13.61 grams (g) of potassium dihydrogen phosphate in water and dilute to 100 ml.
              (2) To prepare the 1 M sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH), dissolve 4.0 g of sodium hydroxide in water and dilute to 100 ml.
              (3) To prepare the buffered 2 percent potassium iodide solution, dissolve 20 g of potassium iodide in 900 ml water. Add 50 ml of the 1 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution and 30 ml of the 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. While stirring solution, measure the pH of solution electrometrically and add the 1 M sodium hydroxide solution to bring pH to between 6.95 and 7.05.
              (4) To prepare the 0.1 normality (N) sodium thiosulfate solution, dissolve 25 g of sodium thiosulfate, pentahydrate, in 800 ml of freshly boiled and cooled distilled water in a 1-liter volumetric flask. Dilute to volume. To prepare the 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate solution, add 10.0 ml standardized 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution to a 100 ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water.
              (5) To standardize the 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution, dissolve 3.249 g of anhydrous potassium bi-iodate, primary standard quality, or 3.567 g potassium iodate dried at 103 =/−2 degrees Centigrade for 1 hour, in distilled water and dilute to 1000 ml to yield a 0.1000 N solution. Store in a glass-stoppered bottle. To 80 ml distilled water, add, with constant stirring, 1 ml concentrated sulfuric acid, 10.00 ml 0.1000 N anhydrous potassium bi-iodate, and 1 g potassium iodide. Titrate immediately with 0.1 n sodium thiosulfate titrant until the yellow color of the liberated iodine is almost discharged. Add 1 ml starch indicator solution and continue titrating until the blue color disappears. The normality of the sodium thiosulfate solution is inversely proportional to the ml of sodium thiosulfate solution consumed:
              
                
                ER15ap98.000
              
              (6) To prepare the starch indicator solution, add a small amount of cold water to 5 g starch and grind in a mortar to obtain a thin paste. Pour paste into 1 L of boiling distilled water, stir, and let settle overnight. Use clear supernate for starch indicator solution.
              (7) To prepare the 10 percent sulfuric acid solution, add 10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to 80 ml water in a 100 ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume.

              (F) The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(F)(1) through (b)(5)(ii)(F)(5) of this section shall be used to perform the sampling.
              (1) Preparation of collection train. Measure 20 ml buffered potassium iodide solution into each of the first two impingers and connect probe, impingers, filter, critical orifice, and pump. The sampling line and the impingers shall be shielded from sunlight.
              (2) Leak and flow check procedure. Plug sampling line inlet tip and turn on pump. If a flow of bubbles is visible in either of the liquid impingers, tighten fittings and adjust connections and impingers. A leakage rate not in excess of 2 percent of the sampling rate is acceptable. Carefully remove the plug from the end of the probe. Check the flow rate at the probe inlet with a bubble tube flow meter. The flow should be comparable or slightly less than the flow rate of the critical orifice with the impingers off-line. Record the flow and turn off the pump.
              (3) Sample collection. Insert the sampling line into the stack and secure it with the tip slightly lower than the port height. Start the pump, recording the time. End the sampling after 60 minutes, or after yellow color is observed in the second in-line impinger. Record time and remove the tubing from the vent. Recheck flow rate at sampling line inlet and turn off pump. If the flow rate has changed significantly, redo sampling with fresh capture solution. A slight variation (less than 5 percent) in flow may be averaged. With the inlet end of the line elevated above the impingers, add about 5 ml water into the inlet tip to rinse the line into the first impinger.
              (4) Sample analysis. Fill the burette with 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate solution to the zero mark. Combine the contents of the impingers in the beaker or flask. Stir the solution and titrate with thiosulfate until the solution is colorless. Record the volume of the first endpoint (TN, ml). Add 5 ml of the 10 percent sulfuric acid solution, and continue the titration until the contents of the flask are again colorless. Record the total volume of titrant required to go through the first and to the second endpoint (TA, ml). If the volume of neutral titer is less than 0.5 ml, repeat the testing for a longer period of time. It is important that sufficient lighting be present to clearly see the endpoints, which are determined when the solution turns from pale yellow to colorless. A lighted stirring plate and a white background are useful for this purpose.
              (5) Interferences. Known interfering agents of this method are sulfur dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Sulfur dioxide, which is used to reduce oxidant residuals in some bleaching systems, reduces formed iodine to iodide in the capture solution. It is therefore a negative interference for chlorine, and in some cases could result in erroneous negative chlorine concentrations. Any agent capable of reducing iodine to iodide could interfere in this manner. A chromium trioxide impregnated filter will capture sulfur dioxide and pass chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Hydrogen peroxide, which is commonly used as a bleaching agent in modern bleaching systems, reacts with iodide to form iodine and thus can cause a positive interference in the chlorine measurement. Due to the chemistry involved, the precision of the chlorine analysis will decrease as the ratio of chlorine dioxide to chlorine increases. Slightly negative calculated concentrations of chlorine may occur when sampling a vent gas with high concentrations of chlorine dioxide and very low concentrations of chlorine.

              (1) Samples shall be collected using the sampling procedures of the test method listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section selected to determine liquid stream HAP concentrations;
              (i) Where feasible, samples shall be taken from an enclosed pipe prior to the liquid stream being exposed to the atmosphere; and

              (iii) Any other method that measures total HAP concentration that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction.
              (4) To determine soluble BOD5 in the effluent stream from an open biological treatment unit used to comply with §§ 63.446(e)(2) and 63.453(j), the owner or operator shall use Method 405.1 of part 136 of this chapter with the following modifications:
              (i) Filter the sample through the filter paper, into an Erlenmeyer flask by applying a vacuum to the flask sidearm. Minimize the time for which vacuum is applied to prevent stripping of volatile organics from the sample. Replace filter paper as often as needed in order to maintain filter times of less than approximately 30 seconds per filter paper. No rinsing of sample container or filter bowl into the Erlenmeyer flask is allowed.

              (ii) Perform Method 405.1 on the filtrate obtained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Dilution water shall be seeded with 1 milliliter of final effluent per liter of dilution water. Dilution ratios may require adjustment to reflect the lower oxygen demand of the filtered sample in comparison to the total BOD5. Three BOD bottles and different dilutions shall be used for each sample.
              (5) If the test method used to determine HAP concentration indicates that a specific HAP is not detectable, the value determined as the minimum measurement level (MML) of the selected test method for the specific HAP shall be used in the compliance demonstration calculations. To determine the MML for a specific HAP using one of the test methods specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, one of the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be performed. The MML for a particular HAP must be determined only if the HAP is not detected in the normal working range of the method.
              (i) To determine the MML for a specific HAP, the following procedures shall be performed each time the method is set up. Set up is defined as the first time the analytical apparatus is placed in operation, after any shut down of 6 months or more, or any time a major component of the analytical apparatus is replaced.
              (A) Select a concentration value for the specific HAP in question to represent the MML. The value of the MML selected shall not be below the calibration standard of the selected test method.

              (B) Measure the concentration of the specific HAP in a minimum of three replicate samples using the selected test method. All replicate samples shall be run through the entire analytical procedure. The samples must contain the specific HAP at the selected MML concentration and should be representative of the liquid streams to be analyzed in the compliance demonstration. Spiking of the liquid samples with a known concentration of the target HAP may be necessary to ensure that the HAP concentration in the three replicate samples is at the selected MML. The concentration of the HAP in the spiked sample must be within 50 percent of the proposed MML for the demonstration to be valid. As an alternative to spiking, a field sample above the MML may be diluted to produce a HAP concentration at the MML. To be a valid demonstration, the diluted sample must have a HAP concentration within 20 percent of the proposed MML, and the field sample must not be diluted by more than a factor of five.
              (C) Calculate the relative standard deviation (RSD) and the upper confidence limit at the 95 percent confidence level using the measured HAP concentrations determined in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section. If the upper confidence limit of the RSD is less than 30 percent, then the selected MML is acceptable. If the upper confidence limit of the RSD is greater than or equal to 30 percent, then the selected MML is too low, and the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this section must be repeated.
              (ii) Provide for the Administrator's approval the selected value of the MML for a specific HAP and the rationale for selecting the MML including all data and calculations used to determine the MML. The approved MML must be used in all applicable compliance demonstration calculations.
              (6) When using the MML determined using the procedures in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section or when using the MML determined using the procedures in paragraph (c)(5)(i), except during set up, the analytical laboratory conducting the analysis must perform and meet the following quality assurance procedures each time a set of samples is analyzed to determine compliance.
              (i) Using the selected test method, analyze in triplicate the concentration of the specific HAP in a representative sample. The sample must contain the specific HAP at a concentration that is within a factor of two of the MML. If there are no samples in the set being analyzed that contain the specific HAP at an appropriate concentration, then a sample below the MML may be spiked to produce the appropriate concentration, or a sample at a higher level may be diluted. After spiking, the sample must contain the specific HAP within 50 percent of the MML. If dilution is used instead, the diluted sample must contain the specific HAP within 20 percent of the MML and must not be diluted by more than a factor of five.
              (ii) Calculate the RSD using the measured HAP concentrations determined in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section. If the RSD is less than 20 percent, then the laboratory is performing acceptably.
              (d) Detectable leak procedures. To measure detectable leaks for closed-vent systems as specified in § 63.450 or for pulping process wastewater collection systems as specified in § 63.446(d)(2)(i), the owner or operator shall comply with the following:

              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million by volume methane or n-hexane.
              (e) Negative pressure procedures. To demonstrate negative pressure at process equipment enclosure openings as specified in § 63.450(b), the owner or operator shall use one of the following procedures:
              (1) An anemometer to demonstrate flow into the enclosure opening;

              (B) Each opening shall be maintained in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a lid that is gasketed and latched) at all times that the tank contains pulping process condensates or any HAPs removed from a pulping process condensate stream except when it is necessary to use the opening for sampling, removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.
              (iv) For each pulping process condensate closed collection system used to comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall perform a visual inspection every 30 days and shall comply with the inspection and monitoring requirements specified in § 63.964 except for the closed-vent system and control device inspection and monitoring requirements specified in § 63.964(a)(2).
              (8) Quarterly performance testing. (i) The owner or operator shall, within 45 days after the beginning of each quarter, conduct a performance test.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall use NCASI Method DI/HAPS-99.01 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) to collect a grab sample and determine the HAP concentration of the Raw Mill Effluent, Pulping Process Condensates, and Anaerobic Basin Discharge for the quarterly performance test conducted during the first quarter each year.
              (iii) For each of the remaining three quarters, the owner or operator may use NCASI Method DI/MEOH 94.03 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) as a surrogate to collect and determine the HAP concentration of the Raw Mill Effluent, Pulping Process Condensates, and Anaerobic Basin Discharge.
              (iv) The sample used to determine the HAP or Methanol concentration in the Raw Mill Effluent, Pulping Process Condensates, or Anaerobic Basin Discharge shall be a composite of four grab samples taken evenly spaced over an eight hour time period.
              (v) The Raw Mill Effluent grab samples shall be taken from the raw mill effluent composite sampler.
              (vi) The Pulping Process Condensates grab samples shall be taken from a line tap on the closed condensate collection system prior to discharge into the wastewater treatment plant.
              (vii) The Anaerobic Basic Discharge grab samples shall be taken subsequent to the confluence of the four anaerobic basin discharges.
              (viii) The flow rate of the Raw Mill Effluent, Pulping Process Condensates, and Anaerobic Basin Discharge, and the production rate of ODP shall be averaged over eight hours.
              (ix) The data collected as specified in paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(8) of this section shall be used to determine the HAP destruction efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
              (x) The HAP destruction efficiency shall be at least as great as that specified by paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
              (9) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) The owner or operator shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements as specified in Table 1 of subpart S of part 63 as it pertains to § 63.10.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 63.454(b).
              (iii) The owner or operator shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 63.453(d).
              (10) Reporting requirements. (i) Each owner or operator shall comply with the reporting requirements as specified in Table 1 of § 63.10.
              (ii) Each owner or operator shall comply with the reporting requirements as specified in § 63.455(d).
              (11) Violations. (i) Failure to comply with any applicable provision of this part shall constitute a violation.
              (ii) Periods of excess emissions shall not constitute a violation provided the time of excess emissions divided by the total process operating time in a semi-annual reporting period does not exceed one percent. All periods of excess emission shall be reported, and shall include:

              (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(11)(ii) of this section, any excess emissions that present an imminent threat to public health or the environment, or may cause serious harm to public health or the environment, shall constitute a violation.

              § 63.460
              Applicability and designation of source.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to each individual batch vapor, in-line vapor, in-line cold, and batch cold solvent cleaning machine that uses any solvent containing methylene chloride (CAS No. 75-09-2), perchloroethylene (CAS No. 127-18-4), trichloroethylene (CAS No. 79-01-6), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CAS No. 71-55-6), carbon tetrachloride (CAS No. 56-23-5) or chloroform (CAS No. 67-66-3), or any combination of these halogenated HAP solvents, in a total concentration greater than 5 percent by weight, as a cleaning and/or drying agent. The concentration of these solvents may be determined using EPA test method 18, material safety data sheets, or engineering calculations. Wipe cleaning activities, such as using a rag containing halogenated solvent or a spray cleaner containing halogenated solvent are not covered under the provisions of this subpart.
              (b) Except as noted in appendix C (General Provisions Applicability to subpart T) of this subpart, the provisions of subpart A of this part (General Provisions) apply to owners or operators of any solvent cleaning machine meeting the applicability criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each solvent cleaning machine subject to this subpart that commenced construction or reconstruction after November 29, 1993 shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except for § 63.471, immediately upon start-up or by December 2, 1994, whichever is later.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each solvent cleaning machine subject to this subpart that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before November 29, 1993 shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except for § 63.471, no later than December 2, 1997.
              (e) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority to a State under section 112(d) of the Act, the authority contained in paragraph (f) of this section shall be retained by the Administrator and not transferred to a State.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Each continuous web cleaning machine subject to this subpart shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except for § 63.471, no later than December 2, 1999.

              (h) If you are an owner or operator of an area source subject to this subpart, you are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, provided you are not required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 71.3(a) for a reason other than your status as an area source under this subpart. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart applicable to area sources.
              (i) The compliance date for the requirements in § 63.471 depends on the date that construction or reconstruction of the affected facility commences. For purposes of this paragraph, affected facility means all solvent cleaning machines, except solvent cleaning machines used in the manufacture and maintenance of aerospace products, solvent cleaning machines used in the manufacture of narrow tubing, and continuous web cleaning machines, located at a major source that are subject to the facility-wide limits in table 1 of § 63.471(b)(2), and for area sources, affected facility means all solvent cleaning machines, except cold batch cleaning machines, located at an area source that are subject to the facility-wide limits in table 1 of § 63.471(b)(2).
              (1) Each affected facility that was constructed or reconstructed on or before August 17, 2006, shall be in compliance with the provisions of this subpart no later than May 3, 2010.
              (2) Each affected facility that was constructed or reconstructed on or after August 17, 2006, shall be in compliance with the provisions of this subpart on May 3, 2007 or immediately upon startup, whichever is later.

              § 63.461
              Definitions.
              Unless defined below, all terms used in this subpart are used as defined in the 1990 Clean Air Act, or in subpart A of 40 CFR part 63:
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or his or her authorized representative (e.g., State that has been delegated the authority to implement the provisions of this part.)
              
                Air blanket means the layer of air inside the solvent cleaning machine freeboard located above the solvent/air interface. The centerline of the air blanket is equidistant between the sides of the machine.
              
                Air knife system means a device that directs forced air at high pressure, high volume, or a combination of high pressure and high volume, through a small opening directly at the surface of a continuous web part. The purpose of this system is to remove the solvent film from the surfaces of the continuous web part.
              
                Automated parts handling system means a mechanical device that carries all parts and parts baskets at a controlled speed from the initial loading of soiled or wet parts through the removal of the cleaned or dried parts. Automated parts handling systems include, but are not limited to, hoists and conveyors.
              
                Batch cleaning machine means a solvent cleaning machine in which individual parts or a set of parts move through the entire cleaning cycle before new parts are introduced into the solvent cleaning machine. An open-top vapor cleaning machine is a type of batch cleaning machine. A solvent cleaning machine, such as a ferris wheel or a cross-rod degreaser, that clean multiple batch loads simultaneously and are manually loaded are batch cleaning machines.
              
                Carbon adsorber means a bed of activated carbon into which an air-solvent gas-vapor stream is routed and which adsorbs the solvent on the carbon.
              
                Clean liquid solvent means fresh unused solvent, recycled solvent, or used solvent that has been cleaned of soils (e.g., skimmed of oils or sludge and strained of metal chips).
              
                Cleaning capacity means, for a cleaning machine without a solvent/air interface, the maximum volume of parts that can be cleaned at one time. In most cases, the cleaning capacity is equal to the volume (length times width times height) of the cleaning chamber.
              
                Cold cleaning machine means any device or piece of equipment that contains and/or uses liquid solvent, into which parts are placed to remove soils from the surfaces of the parts or to dry the parts. Cleaning machines that contain and use heated, nonboiling solvent to clean the parts are classified as cold cleaning machines.
              
                Combined squeegee and air-knife system means a system consisting of a combination of a squeegee system and an air-knife system within a single enclosure.

                Primary condenser means a series of circumferential cooling coils on a vapor cleaning machine through which a chilled substance is circulated or recirculated to provide continuous condensation of rising solvent vapors and, thereby, create a concentrated solvent vapor zone.
              
                Reduced room draft means decreasing the flow or movement of air across the top of the freeboard area of the solvent cleaning machine to meet the specifications of § 63.463(e)(2)(ii). Methods of achieving a reduced room draft include, but are not limited to, redirecting fans and/or air vents to not blow across the cleaning machine, moving the cleaning machine to a corner where there is less room draft, and constructing a partial or complete enclosure around the cleaning machine.
              
                Remote reservoir cold cleaning machine means any device in which liquid solvent is pumped to a sink-like work area that drains solvent back into an enclosed container while parts are being cleaned, allowing no solvent to pool in the work area.
              
                Remote reservoir continuous web cleaning machine means a continuous web cleaning machine in which there is no exposed solvent sump. In these units, the solvent is pumped from an enclosed chamber and is typically applied to the continuous web part through a nozzle or series of nozzles. The solvent then drains from the part and is collected and recycled through the machine, allowing no solvent to pool in the work or cleaning area.
              
                Soils means contaminants that are removed from the parts being cleaned. Soils include, but are not limited to, grease, oils, waxes, metal chips, carbon deposits, fluxes, and tars.
              
                Solvent/air interface means, for a vapor cleaning machine, the location of contact between the concentrated solvent vapor layer and the air. This location of contact is defined as the mid-line height of the primary condenser coils. For a cold cleaning machine, it is the location of contact between the liquid solvent and the air.
              
                Solvent/air interface area means; for a vapor cleaning machine, the surface area of the solvent vapor zone that is exposed to the air; for an in-line cleaning machine, it is the total surface area of all the sumps; for a cold cleaning machine, it is the surface area of the liquid solvent that is exposed to the air.
              
                Solvent cleaning machine means any device or piece of equipment that uses halogenated HAP solvent liquid or vapor to remove soils from the surfaces of materials. Types of solvent cleaning machines include, but are not limited to, batch vapor, in-line vapor, in-line cold, and batch cold solvent cleaning machines.

                Squeegee system means a system that uses a series of pliable surfaces to remove the solvent film from the surfaces of the continuous web part. These pliable surfaces, called squeegees, are typically made of rubber or plastic media, and need to be periodically replaced to ensure continued proper function.
              
                Sump means the part of a solvent cleaning machine where the liquid solvent is located.

                Superheated part technology means a system that is part of the continuous web process that heats the continuous web part either directly or indirectly to a temperature above the boiling point of the cleaning solvent. This could include a process step, such as a tooling die that heats the part as it is processed, as long as the part remains superheated through the cleaning machine.
              
                Superheated vapor system means a system that heats the solvent vapor, either passively or actively, to a temperature above the solvent's boiling point. Parts are held in the superheated vapor before exiting the machine to evaporate the liquid solvent on them. Hot vapor recycle is an example of a superheated vapor system.
              
                Vapor cleaning machine means a batch or in-line solvent cleaning machine that boils liquid solvent generating solvent vapor that is used as a part of the cleaning or drying cycle.
              
                Water layer means a layer of water that floats above the denser solvent and provides control of solvent emissions. In many cases, the solvent used in batch cold cleaning machines is sold containing the appropriate amount of water to create a water cover.
              
                Working mode means the time period when the solvent cleaning machine is actively cleaning parts.
              
                Working-mode cover means any cover or solvent cleaning machine design that allows the cover to shield the cleaning machine openings from outside air disturbances while parts are being cleaned in the cleaning machine. A cover that is used during the working mode is opened only during parts entry and removal. A cover that meets this definition can also be used as an idling-mode cover if that definition is also met.

              § 63.463
              Batch vapor and in-line cleaning machine standards.

              (a) Except as provided in § 63.464 for all cleaning machines, each owner or operator of a solvent cleaning machine subject to the provisions of this subpart shall ensure that each existing or new batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine subject to the provisions of this subpart conforms to the design requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section.

                  Note: Unlike most of the control techniques available for complying with this rule, carbon adsorbers are not considered to be a pollution prevention measure. Use of such units may impose additional cost and burden for a number of reasons. First, carbon adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these units may present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent carbon beds have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. When making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible.

                  Note: Unlike most of the control techniques available for complying with this rule, carbon adsorbers are not considered to be a pollution prevention measure. Use of such units may impose additional cost and burden for a number of reasons. First, carbon adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these units may present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent carbon beds have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. When making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible.

This includes, but is not limited to, fresh unused solvent, recycled solvent, and used solvent that has been cleaned of soils. A fill line must be indicated during the first month the measurements are made. The solvent level within the machine must be returned to the same fill-line each month, immediately prior to calculating monthly emissions as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The solvent cleaning machine does not have to be emptied and filled with fresh unused solvent prior to the calculations.

                LSRi = the total amount of halogenated HAP liquid solvent removed from the solvent cleaning machine during the most recent monthly reporting period i, (kilograms of solvent per month).
                SSRi = the total amount of halogenated HAP solvent removed from the solvent cleaning machine in solid waste, obtained as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, during the most recent monthly reporting period i, (kilograms of solvent per month).
                AREAi = the solvent/air interface area of the solvent cleaning machine (square meters).
              
              
              (2) Determine SSRi using the method specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (i) From tests conducted using EPA reference method 25d.

                ER02DE94.003
              
              
                Where:
                
                EAi = the average halogenated HAP solvent emissions over the preceding 3 monthly reporting periods, (kilograms of solvent per square meter of solvent/air interface area per month).
                EAn = the average halogenated HAP solvent emissions over the preceding 3 monthly reporting periods (kilograms of solvent per month).
                Ei = halogenated HAP solvent emissions for each month (j) for the most recent 3 monthly reporting periods (kilograms of solvent per square meter of solvent/air interface area).
                En = halogenated HAP solvent emissions for each month (j) for the most recent 3 monthly reporting periods (kilograms of solvent per month).
                j = 1 = the most recent monthly reporting period.

                j = 3 = the monthly reporting period immediately prior to j = 2.
              
              
              (d) Each owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine using a dwell to comply with § 63.463 shall determine the appropriate dwell time for each part or parts basket using the procedure specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
              (1) Determine the amount of time for the part or parts basket to cease dripping once placed in the vapor zone. The part or parts basket used for this determination must be at room temperature before being placed in the vapor zone.
              (2) The proper dwell time for parts to remain in the freeboard area above the vapor zone is no less than 35 percent of the time determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
              (e) An owner or operator of a source shall determine their potential to emit from all solvent cleaning operations, using the procedures described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section. A facility's total potential to emit is the sum of the HAP emissions from all solvent cleaning operations, plus all HAP emissions from other sources within the facility.

              (1) Determine the potential to emit for each individual solvent cleaning using equation 6.
              
              PTEi = Hi × Wi × SAIi (6)
              
              
                Where:
                
                PTEi = the potential to emit for solvent cleaning machine i (kilograms of solvent per year).
                Hi = hours of operation for solvent cleaning machine i (hours per year).
                 = 8760 hours per year, unless otherwise restricted by a Federally enforceable requirement.
                Wi = the working mode uncontrolled emission rate (kilograms per square meter per hour).
                 = 1.95 kilograms per square meter per hour for batch vapor and cold cleaning machines.
                 = 1.12 kilograms per square meter per hour for in-line cleaning machines.
                SAIi = solvent/air interface area of solvent cleaning machine i (square meters). Section 63.461 defines the solvent/air interface area for those machines that have a solvent/air interface. Cleaning machines that do not have a solvent/air interface shall calculate a solvent/air interface area using the procedure in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
              
              

              (2) Cleaning machines that do not have a solvent/air interface shall calculate a solvent/air interface area using equation 7.
              
              SAI = 2.20 * (Vol)0.6  (7)
              
              
                Where:
                
                SAI = the solvent/air interface area (square meters).
                Vol = the cleaning capacity of the solvent cleaning machine (cubic meters).
              
              
              (3) Sum the PTEi for all solvent cleaning operations to obtain the total potential to emit for solvent cleaning operations at the facility.
              (f) Each owner or operator of a continuous web cleaning machine using a squeegee system to comply with § 63.463(g)(3) shall determine the maximum product throughput using the method in this paragraph. The maximum product throughput for each squeegee type used at a facility must be determined prior to December 2, 1999, the compliance date for these units.
              (1) Conduct daily visual inspections of the continuous web part. This monitoring shall be conducted at the point where the continuous web part exits the squeegee system. It is not necessary for the squeegees to be new at the time monitoring is begun if the following two conditions are met:
              (i) The continuous web part leaving the squeegee system has no visible solvent film.

              (ii) The amount of continuous web that has been processed through the squeegees since the last replacement is known.
              
              (2) Continue daily monitoring until a visible solvent film is noted on the continuous web part.
              (3) Determine the length of continuous web product that has been cleaned using the squeegee since it was installed.
              (4) The maximum product throughput for the purposes of this rule is equal to the time it takes to clean 95 percent of the length of product determined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. This time period, in days, may vary depending on the amount of continuous web product cleaned each day.
              (g) Each owner or operator of a continuous web cleaning machine demonstrating compliance with the alternative standard of § 63.464(d) shall, on the first day of every month, ensure that the solvent cleaning machine contains only clean liquid solvent. This includes, but is not limited to, fresh unused solvent, recycled solvent, and used solvent that has been cleaned of soils. A fill-line must be indicated during the first month the measurements are made. The solvent level with the machine must be returned to the same fill-line each month, immediately prior to calculating overall cleaning system control efficiency emissions as specified in paragraph (h) in this section. The solvent cleaning machine does not need to be emptied and filled with fresh unused solvent prior to the calculation.
              (h) Each owner or operator of a continuous web cleaning machines complying with § 63.464(d) shall, on the first operating day of the month, comply with the following requirements.

              (1) Using the records of all solvent additions, solvent deletions, and solvent recovered from the carbon adsorption system for the previous monthly reporting period required under § 63.467(e), determine the overall cleaning system control efficiency (Eo) using Equation 8 of this section as follows:
              
                ER08SE00.003
              
              
                Where:
                
                Eo = overall cleaning system control efficiency.
                Ri = the total amount of halogenated HAP liquid solvent recovered from the carbon adsorption system and recycled to the solvent cleaning system during the most recent monthly reporting period, i, (kilograms of solvent per month).
                Sai = the total amount of halogenated HAP liquid solvent added to the solvent cleaning system during the most recent monthly reporting period, i, (kilograms of solvent per month).
                SSRi = the total amount of halogenated HAP solvent removed from the solvent cleaning system in solid waste, obtained as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, during the most recent monthly reporting period, i, (kilograms of solvent per month).

              Applicability and designation of affected sources.
              (a) Definition of affected source. The provisions of this subpart apply to each affected source. Affected sources are described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
              (1) An affected source is either an existing affected source or a new affected source. Existing affected source is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and new affected source is defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              (2) An existing affected source is defined as each group of one or more elastomer product process units (EPPU) and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is not part of a new affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, that is manufacturing the same primary product and that is located at a plant site that is a major source.
              (3) A new affected source is defined by the criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), or (a)(3)(iii) of this section. The situation described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is distinct from those situations described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii) of this section and from any situation described in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (i) At a site without HAP emission points before June 12, 1995 (i.e., a “greenfield” site), each group of one or more EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is manufacturing the same primary product and that is part of a major source on which construction commenced after June 12, 1995;
              (ii) A group of one or more EPPU meeting the criteria in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section; or
              (iii) A reconstructed affected source meeting the criteria in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section.
              (4) Emission points and equipment. The affected source also includes the emission points and equipment specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iv) of this section that are associated with each applicable group of one or more EPPU constituting an affected source.
              (i) Each waste management unit.
              (ii) Maintenance wastewater.
              (iii) Each heat exchange system.
              (iv) Equipment required by, or utilized as a method of compliance with, this subpart which may include control devices and recovery devices.
              (5) EPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that are located at plant sites that are not major sources are neither affected sources nor part of an affected source.
              (b) EPPUs without organic HAP. The owner or operator of an EPPU that is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, but that does not use or manufacture any organic HAP shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. Such an EPPU is not subject to any other provision of this subpart and is not required to comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part.
              (1) Retain information, data, and analyses used to document the basis for the determination that the EPPU does not use or manufacture any organic HAP. Types of information that could document this determination include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
              (2) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the EPPU does not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
              (c) Emission points not subject to the provisions of this subpart. The affected source includes the emission points listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section, but these emission points are not subject to the requirements of this subpart or to the provisions of subpart A of this part.
              (1) Equipment that does not contain organic HAP and is located at an EPPU that is part of an affected source;
              (2) Stormwater from segregated sewers;
              (3) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems in segregated sewers;
              (4) Spills;
              (5) Water from safety showers;
              (6) Water from testing of deluge systems;
              (7) Water from testing of firefighting systems;
              (8) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that contains no organic HAP or organic HAP as impurities only; and
              (9) Equipment that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for less than 300 hours during the calendar year.
              (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. Research and development facilities are exempted from the affected source.
              (e) Applicability determination of elastomer equipment included in a process unit producing a non-elastomer product. If an elastomer product that is subject to this subpart is produced within a process unit that is subject to subpart JJJ of this part, and at least 50 percent of the elastomer is used in the production of the product manufactured by the subpart JJJ process unit, the unit operations involved in the production of the elastomer are considered part of the process unit that is subject to subpart JJJ, and not this subpart.
              (f) Primary product determination and applicability. An owner or operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce an elastomer product shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with this paragraph. The owner or operator shall initially determine whether a process unit is designated as an EPPU and subject to the provisions of this subpart in accordance with either paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit that was not initially designated as an EPPU, but in which an elastomer product is produced, shall conduct an annual re-determination of the applicability of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Owners or operators that anticipate the production of an elastomer product in a process unit that was not initially designated as an EPPU, and in which no elastomer products are currently produced, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) through (f)(7) of this section discuss compliance only for flexible operation units. Other paragraphs apply to all process units, including flexible operation units, unless otherwise noted. Paragraph (f)(8) of this section contains reporting requirements associated with the applicability determinations. Paragraphs (f)(9) and (f)(10) describe criteria for removing the EPPU designation from a process unit.
              (1) Initial determination. The owner or operator shall initially determine if a process unit is subject to the provisions of this subpart based on the primary product of the process unit in accordance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. If the process unit never uses or manufactures any organic HAP, regardless of the outcome of the primary product determination, the only requirements of this subpart that might apply to the process unit are contained in paragraph (b) of this section. If a flexible operation unit does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the manufacture of one or more products, paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section applies to that flexible operation unit.
              (i) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
              (ii) If a process unit produces more than one intended product at the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
              (A) The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of the process unit, or
              (B) If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on a mass basis for two or more products, and if one of those products is an elastomer product, then the elastomer product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
              (iii) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following September 5, 1996 at existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins production of any product for new process units. If operations cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
              (A) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for the greatest operating time over the specified five year period for existing process units, or the specified one year period for new process units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
              (B) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified five year period for existing process units, or the specified one year period for new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
              (iv) If, according to paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the primary product of a process unit is an elastomer product, then that process unit shall be designated as an EPPU. That EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. If the primary product of a process unit is determined to be a product that is not an elastomer product, then that process unit is not an EPPU.
              (2) If the primary product cannot be determined for a flexible operation unit in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.
              (i) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, but can determine that an elastomer product is not the primary product, then that flexible operation unit is not an EPPU.
              (ii) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, and cannot determine that an elastomer product is not the primary product as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) or (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

              (A) If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as an EPPU if an elastomer product was produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating time of the flexible operation unit since March 9, 1999. That EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. For a flexible operation unit that is designated as an EPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the elastomer product produced for the greatest amount of time since March 9, 1999 shall be designated as the primary product of the EPPU.
              (B) If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as an EPPU if the owner or operator anticipates that an elastomer product will be manufactured in the flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the date the unit begins production of any product. That EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other EPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. For a process unit that is designated as an EPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the elastomer product that will be produced shall be designated as the primary product of the EPPU. If more than one elastomer product will be produced, the owner or operator may select which elastomer product is designated as the primary product.
              (3) Annual applicability determination for non-EPPUs that have produced an elastomer product. Once per year beginning September 5, 2001, the owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not designated as an EPPU, but that has produced an elastomer product at any time in the preceding five-year period or since the date that the unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section. However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce any elastomer product in the future, in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this section, is not required to perform the evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
              (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time over which the product was produced during the preceding five-year period.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the preceding five-year period.
              (iii) If the primary product identified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) is an elastomer product, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as an EPPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is an EPPU, and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section for the flexible operation unit.
              (4) Applicability determination for non-EPPUs that have not produced an elastomer product. The owner or operator that anticipates the production of an elastomer product in a process unit that is not designated as an EPPU, and in which no elastomer products have been produced in the previous 5 year period or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. Also, owners or operators who have notified the Administrator that a process unit is not an EPPU in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this section, that now anticipate the production of an elastomer product in the process unit, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.

              (i) The owner or operator shall use the procedures in paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section to determine if the process unit is designated as an EPPU, with the following exception: for existing process units that are determining the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, production shall be projected for the five years following the date that the owner or operator anticipates initiating the production of an elastomer product.
              (ii) If the unit is designated as an EPPU in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
              (5) Compliance for flexible operation units. Owners or operators of EPPUs that are flexible operation units shall comply with the standards specified for the primary product, with the exceptions provided in paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product in which no organic HAP is used or manufactured, the owner or operator is only required to comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate compliance for activities associated with the manufacture of that product. This subpart does not require compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part for activities associated with the manufacture of a product that meets the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section.
              (ii) Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product that makes it subject to subpart GGG of this part, the owner or operator is not required to comply with the provisions of this subpart during the production of that product.
              (6) Owners or operators of EPPUs that are flexible operation units have the option of determining the group status of each emission point associated with the flexible operation unit, in accordance with either paragraph (f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, with the exception of batch front-end process vents. For batch front-end process vents, the owner or operator shall determine the group status in accordance with § 63.488.
              (i) The owner or operator may determine the group status of each emission point based on emission point characteristics when the primary product is being manufactured.
              (ii) The owner or operator may determine the group status of each emission point separately for each product produced by the flexible operation unit. For each product, the group status shall be determined using the emission point characteristics when that product is being manufactured and using the Group 1 criteria specified for the primary product. (Note: Under this scenario, it is possible that the group status, and therefore the requirement to achieve emission reductions, for an emission point may change depending on the product being manufactured.)
              (7) Owners or operators determining the group status of emission points in flexible operation units based solely on the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section shall establish parameter monitoring levels, as required, in accordance with either paragraph (f)(7)(i) or (f)(7)(ii) of this section. Owners or operators determining the group status of emission points in flexible operation units based on each product in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section shall establish parameter monitoring levels, as required, in accordance with paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.
              (i) Establish separate parameter monitoring levels in accordance with § 63.505(a) for each individual product.
              (ii) Establish a single parameter monitoring level (for each parameter required to be monitored at each device subject to monitoring requirements) in accordance with § 63.505(a) that would apply for all products.
              (8) Reporting requirements. When it is determined that a process unit is an EPPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart, the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.506(e)(5) shall include the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this section, as applicable. If it is determined that the process unit is not subject to this subpart, the owner or operator shall either retain all information, data, and analysis used to document the basis for the determination that the primary product is not an elastomer product, or, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the process unit is not subject to this subpart.
              (i) If the EPPU manufactures only one elastomer product, identification of that elastomer product.

              (ii) If the EPPU is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(ii)(A) through (f)(8)(ii)(D) of this section, as appropriate, shall be submitted.
              (A) If a primary product could be determined, identification of the primary product.
              (B) Identification of which compliance option, either paragraph (f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, has been selected by the owner or operator.
              (C) If the option to establish separate parameter monitoring levels for each product in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section is selected, the identification of each product and the corresponding parameter monitoring level.
              (D) If the option to establish a single parameter monitor level in paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section is selected, the parameter monitoring level for each parameter.
              (9) EPPUs terminating production of all elastomer products. If an EPPU terminates the production of all elastomer products and does not anticipate the production of any elastomer products in the future, the process unit is no longer an EPPU and is not subject to this subpart after notification is made to the Administrator. This notification shall be accompanied by a rationale for why it is anticipated that no elastomer products will be produced in the process unit in the future.
              (10) Redetermination of applicability to EPPUs that are flexible operation units. Whenever changes in production occur that could reasonably be expected to change the primary product of an EPPU that is operating as a flexible operation unit from an elastomer product to a product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of this part, the owner or operator shall re-evaluate the status of the process unit as an EPPU in accordance with paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time in which the product was produced for the preceding five-year period, or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the period.
              (iii) If the conditions in (f)(10)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section are met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be designated as an EPPU after the compliance date of the other subpart and shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this subpart after the date that the process unit is required to be in compliance with the provisions of the other subpart of this part to which it is subject. If the conditions in paragraphs (f)(10)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit shall continue to be considered an EPPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart.
              (A) The product identified in (f)(10)(ii) of this section is not an elastomer product; and
              (B) The production of the product identified in (f)(10)(ii) of this section is subject to another subpart of this part; and
              (C) The owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator of the pending change in applicability.
              (g) Storage vessel ownership determination. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(7) of this section to determine to which process unit a storage vessel shall be assigned. Paragraph (g)(8) of this section specifies when an owner or operator is required to redetermine to which process unit a storage vessel is assigned.
              (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on September 5, 1996, that storage vessel shall be assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
              (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
              (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit that has the predominant use of the storage vessel.)

              (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if only one of those process units is an EPPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that EPPU.
              
              (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are EPPUs that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the storage vessel to any one of the EPPUs sharing the storage vessel.
              (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding September 5, 1996 or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 5, 1996, whichever is more representative of the expected operations for that storage vessel for existing affected sources, and based on the expected utilization for the first 5 years after initial start-up for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by § 63.506(e)(5)(vii).
              (7) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that includes one or more process units which place material into, or receive materials from the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (g)(7)(i) through (g)(7)(iv) of this section.
              (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping both to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.
              (ii) If there is no process unit at the major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.
              (iii) If there is only one process unit at the major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit. Applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel shall then be determined according to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (iv) If there are two or more process units at the major source that meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (g)(3) through (g)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section.
              (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit that was included in the initial determination, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that storage vessel.
              (h) Recovery operations equipment ownership determination. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(6) of this section to determine to which process unit recovery operations equipment shall be assigned. Paragraph (h)(7) of this section specifies when an owner or operator is required to redetermine to which process unit the recovery operations equipment is assigned.
              (1) If recovery operations equipment is already subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on September 5, 1996, that recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
              (2) If recovery operations equipment is dedicated to a single process unit, the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to that process unit.

              (3) If recovery operations equipment is shared among process units, then the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to that process unit located on the same plant site as the recovery operations equipment that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operations equipment (i.e., that process unit has the predominant use of the recovery operations equipment).
              (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process units is an EPPU subject to this subpart, the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to the EPPU subject to this subpart.
              (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are EPPUs that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the recovery operation equipment to any one of those EPPUs.
              (6) If the predominant use of recovery operations equipment varies from year to year, then the predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding September 5, 1996 for existing affected sources or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 5, 1996 for existing affected sources, whichever is the more representative of the expected operations for the recovery operations equipment, and based on the expected utilization for the first 5 years after initial start-up for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by § 63.506(e)(5)(viii).
              (7) If a piece of recovery operations equipment begins receiving material from a process unit that was not included in the initial determination, or ceases to receive material from a process unit that was included in the initial determination, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that recovery operations equipment.
              (i) Changes or additions to plant sites. The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4) of this section apply to owners or operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source. Paragraph (i)(5) provides examples of what are and are not considered process changes for purposes of paragraph (i) of this section. Paragraph (i)(6) of this section discusses reporting requirements.
              (1) Adding an EPPU to a plant site. The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add one or more EPPUs to a plant site.
              (i) If a group of one or more EPPUs that produce the same primary product is added to a plant site, the added group of one or more EPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever is later, if the added group of one or more EPPUs meets the criteria in either paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A) or (i)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and if the criteria in either paragraph (i)(1)(i)(C) or (i)(1)(i)(D) of this section are met.
              (A) The construction of the group of one or more EPPUs commenced after June 12, 1995.
              (B) The construction or reconstruction, for process units that have become EPPUs, commenced after June 12, 1995.
              (C) The group of one or more EPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of any HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of HAP, and the primary product of the group of one or more EPPUs is currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an affected source; or
              (D) The primary product of the group of one or more EPPUs is not currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an affected source, and the plant site meets, or after the addition of the group of one or more EPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, will meet the definition of a major source.

              (ii) If a group of one or more EPPUs that produce the same primary product is added to a plant site, and the group of one or more EPPUs does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the definition of a major source, the group of one or more EPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall comply with the requirements for an existing affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 19, 2001; or by 6 months after notifying the Administrator that a process unit has been designated as an EPPU (in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section), whichever is later.
              (2) Adding emission points or making process changes to existing affected sources. The provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add emission points or make process changes to an existing affected source.
              (i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever is later.
              (A) The replacement of components meets the definition of reconstruction in § 63.482(b); and
              (B) Such reconstruction commenced after June 12, 1995.
              (ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) and (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are not met and that replacement of components creates one or more emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, back-end process operations subject to §§ 63.493 and 63.500, and heat exchange systems and equipment leak components subject to § 63.502), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.481 (i.e., July 31, 1997 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.502, and June 19, 2001 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
              (iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process change that solely replaces components) is made that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, back-end process operations subject to §§ 63.493 through 63.500, and heat exchange systems and equipment leak components subject to § 63.502), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.481 (i.e., July 31, 1997 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.502, and June 19, 2001 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
              (3) Existing affected source requirements for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers that become subject to subpart H requirements. If a process change or the addition of an emission point causes a surge control vessel or bottoms receiver to become subject to § 63.170 under this paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.
              (4) Existing affected source requirements for compressors that become subject to subpart H requirements. If a process change or the addition of an emission point causes a compressor to become subject to § 63.164 under this paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by the compliance date for that compressor, as specified in § 63.481(d), whichever is later.
              (5) Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in feedstock type or process catalyst type, or whenever the replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment, or equipment changes that increase production capacity. For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, process changes do not include: process upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.
              (6) Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source. Owners or operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as specified in § 63.506(e)(7)(v).
              (j) Applicability of this subpart. Paragraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section shall be followed during periods of non-operation of the affected source or any part thereof.
              (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. However, if a period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable emission limitations of this subpart during the period of non-operation. For example, if there is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of the affected source would still be required to be controlled in accordance with the emission limitations in § 63.484.
              (2) The emission limitations set forth in subpart H of this part, as referred to in § 63.502, shall apply at all times, except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized, resulting in cessation of the emissions to which § 63.502 applies.
              (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment.
              (4) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (i) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (j)(4)(ii) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (A) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;
              (B) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;
              (C) The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;
              (D) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

              (E) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;
              
              (F) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation, if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;
              (G) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;
              (H) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (I) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (ii) Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

              (iv) The compressor will be modified to permit connecting the compressor to a fuel gas system or closed vent system, or be modified so that emissions from the compressor can be routed to a process.
              (2) Compliance with the compressor provisions of § 63.164 shall occur no later than March 5, 1998, for any compressor meeting all the criteria in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
              (i) The compressor meets one or more of the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section;
              (ii) The work can be accomplished without a process unit shutdown as defined in § 63.161;
              (iii) The additional time is actually necessary, due to the unavailability of parts beyond the control of the owner or operator; and
              (iv) The owner or operator submits the request for a compliance extension to the appropriate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional Office at the address listed in § 63.13 no later than 45 days before the compliance date. The request for a compliance extension shall contain the information specified in § 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D). Unless the EPA Regional Office objects to the request for a compliance extension within 30 days after receipt of the request, the request shall be deemed approved.
              (3) If compliance with the compressor provisions of § 63.164 cannot reasonably be achieved without a process unit shutdown, the owner or operator shall achieve compliance no later than September 5, 1998. The owner or operator who elects to use this provision shall submit a request for an extension of compliance in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
              (4) Compliance with the compressor provisions of § 63.164 shall occur no later than September 5, 1999 for any compressor meeting one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iii) of this section. The owner or operator who elects to use these provisions shall submit a request for an extension of compliance in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
              (i) Compliance cannot be achieved without replacing the compressor;

              (6) Compliance with the heat exchange system provisions of § 63.104 shall occur no later than June 19, 2001.
              (e) Pursuant to section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected source up to 1 additional year to comply with section 112(d) standards. For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be submitted to the permitting authority as part of the operating permit application, or to the Administrator as a separate submittal or as part of the Precompliance Report. Requests for extensions shall be submitted no later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, or as specified elsewhere in this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The dates specified in § 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply to this subpart.

              (1) A request for an extension of compliance shall include the data described in § 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D).
              
              (2) The requirements in §§ 63.6(i)(8) through 63.6(i)(14) shall govern the review and approval of requests for extensions of compliance with this subpart.
              (3) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request shall include, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a statement of the reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of the circumstances necessitating a request for a compliance extension under this paragraph (e)(3).
              (f) Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this subpart. For the purposes of this subpart, Table 3 of subpart F is not applicable.
              (g) Table 2 of this subpart summarizes the provisions of subparts F, G, and H that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this subpart.
              (h)(1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart I, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart.
              (2) Sources subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart I that have elected to comply through a quality improvement program, as specified in § 63.175 or § 63.176 or both, may elect to continue these programs without interruption as a means of complying with this subpart. In other words, becoming subject to this subpart does not restart or reset the “compliance clock” as it relates to reduced burden earned through a quality improvement program.
              (i) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart and that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, that storage vessel shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.
              (j) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, the source shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV.
              (k) Applicability of other regulations for monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting with respect to combustion devices, recovery devices, or recapture devices. After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC, or is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265 subpart AA or CC and the owner or operator complies with the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC that would apply to the device if the facility had final-permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart. The owner or operator shall identify which option has been selected in the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.506(e)(5).
              (l) Applicability of other requirements for heat exchange systems or waste management units. Paragraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) of this section address instances in which certain requirements from other regulations also apply for the same heat exchange system(s) or waste management unit(s) that are subject to this subpart.

              (1) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a standard identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat exchange system.
              (i) Subpart F of this part.
              (ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with § 63.104 (e.g., subpart JJJ of this part).
              (2) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, if any waste management unit subject to this subpart is also subject to a standard identified in paragraph (l)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in paragraph (l)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that waste management unit.
              (i) Subpart G of this part.
              (ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with §§ 63.132 through 63.147 (e.g., subpart JJJ of this part).
              (m) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual), unless specified otherwise in the section or paragraph that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.
              (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
              (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (m)(2)(i) or (m)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.
              (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 2 weeks for tasks that shall be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that shall be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that shall be performed annually; or
              (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.
              (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

              § 63.483
              Emission standards.
              (a) At all times, each owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. Except as allowed under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing or new affected source shall comply with the provisions in:
              (1) Section 63.484 for storage vessels;
              (2) Section 63.485 for continuous front-end process vents;

              (9) Section 63.506 for general reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
              (b) When emissions of different kinds (i.e., emissions from continuous front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, storage vessels, process wastewater, and/or in-process equipment subject to § 63.149) are combined, and at least one of the emission streams would be classified as Group 1 in the absence of combination with other emission streams, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate. For purposes of this paragraph (b), owners or operators of affected sources with combined emission streams containing one or more batch front-end process vents and containing one or more continuous front-end process vents may comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate. For purposes of this paragraph (b), owners or operators of affected sources with combined emission streams containing one or more batch front-end process vents but not containing one or more continuous process vents shall comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (1) Comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart for each kind of emission in the stream as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section.
              (2) Comply with the first set of requirements, identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section, which applies to any individual emission stream that is included in the combined stream, where either that emission stream would be classified as Group 1 in the absence of combination with other emission streams, or the owner or operator chooses to consider that emission stream to be Group 1 for purposes of this paragraph. Compliance with the first applicable set of requirements identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section constitutes compliance with all other requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section applicable to other types of emissions in the combined stream.
              (i) The requirements of this subpart for Group 1 continuous front-end process vents, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;
              (ii) The requirements of § 63.119(e), as specified in § 63.484, for control of emissions from Group 1 storage vessels, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;

              (iii) The requirements of § 63.139, as specified in § 63.501, for control devices used to control emissions from waste management units, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;
              (iv) The requirements of § 63.139, as specified in § 63.501, for closed vent systems for control of emissions from in-process equipment subject to § 63.149, as specified in § 63.501, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting; or
              (v) The requirements of this subpart for aggregate batch vent streams, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
              (3) The owner or operator of an affected source with combined emission streams containing one or more batch front-end process vents, but not containing one or more continuous front-end process vents, shall comply with paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with § 63.486 for the batch front-end process vent stream(s).
              (ii) The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate, for the remaining emission streams.
              (c) Instead of complying with §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.493, and 63.501, the owner or operator of an existing affected source may elect to control any or all of the storage vessels, continuous front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, back-end process emissions, and wastewater streams and associated waste management units within the affected source, to different levels using an emissions averaging compliance approach that uses the procedures specified in § 63.503. The restrictions concerning which emission points may be included in an emissions average, including how many emission points may be included, are specified in § 63.503(a)(1). An owner or operator electing to use emissions averaging shall still comply with the provisions of §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63. 486, 63.493, and 63.501 for affected source emission points not included in the emissions average.
              (d) A State may decide not to allow the use of the emissions averaging compliance approach specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

Owners or operators may achieve compliance with this paragraph through the control of selected batch emission episodes or the control of portions of selected batch emission episodes. Documentation demonstrating how the 90 weight percent emission reduction is achieved is required by § 63.490(c)(2).
              (b) Aggregate batch vent streams. The owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream that contains one or more Group 1 batch front-end process vents shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

For purposes of complying with the 20 ppmv outlet concentration standard, the outlet concentration shall be calculated on a dry basis. When a combustion device is used for purposes of complying with the 20 ppmv outlet concentration standard, the concentration shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen if supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions.

              (2) A halogen reduction device may be used to reduce the halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 3,750 kg/yr for batch front-end process vents or aggregate batch vent streams and thus make the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream nonhalogenated. The nonhalogenated batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream shall then comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.
              (d) If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device.

              § 63.488
              Methods and procedures for batch front-end process vent group determination.
              (a) General requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of batch front-end process vents at affected sources shall determine the group status of each batch front-end process vent in accordance with the provisions of this section. This determination may be based on either organic HAP or TOC emissions.
              (1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) shall be followed to determine the group status of each batch front-end process vent. This determination shall be made in accordance with either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch front-end process vent based on the expected mix of products. For each product, emission characteristics of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for that product, shall be used in the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.

              (ii) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch front-end process vent based on annualized production of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation. The annualized production of the highest-HAP recipe shall be based exclusively on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe of all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation for a 12 month period. The production level used may be the actual production rate. It is not necessary to assume a maximum production rate (i.e., 8,760 hours per year at maximum design production).
              (iii) The single highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe of the product with the highest total mass of HAP charged to the reactor during the production of a single batch of product.
              (2) The annual uncontrolled organic HAP or TOC emissions and annual average batch vent flow rate shall be determined at the exit from the batch unit operation. For the purposes of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation column, the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a stripper operated in batch mode, and the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a distillation operation operated in batch mode shall be considered part of the batch unit operation. All other devices that recover or oxidize organic HAP or TOC vapors shall be considered control devices as defined in § 63.482.
              (3) The owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent complying with the flare provisions in § 63.487(a)(1) or § 63.487(b)(1) or routing the batch front-end process vent to a control device to comply with the requirements in § 63.487(a)(2) or § 63.487(b)(2) is not required to perform the batch front-end process vent group determination described in this section, but shall comply with all requirements applicable to Group 1 batch front-end process vents.
              (b) Determination of annual emissions. The owner or operator shall calculate annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions for each batch front-end process vent using the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section. To estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, or direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Engineering assessment may also be used to estimate emissions from a batch emission episode, but only under the conditions described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In using the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, individual component vapor pressure and molecular weight may be obtained from standard references. Methods to determine individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems are described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. Other variables in the emissions estimation equations may be obtained through direct measurement, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, through engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, by process knowledge, or by any other appropriate means. Assumptions used in determining these variables must be documented. Once emissions for the batch emission episode have been determined using either the emissions estimation equations, direct measurement, or engineering assessment, emissions from a batch cycle shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and annual emissions from the batch front-end process vent shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
              (1) TOC or organic HAP emissions from the purging of an empty vessel shall be calculated using Equation 1. This equation does not take into account evaporation of any residual liquid in the vessel.

The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used provided the results are still relevant to the current batch front-end process vent conditions. Performance tests shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(iii) of this section.

              (A) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
              (B) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
              (iv) If an integrated sample is taken over the entire batch emission episode to determine average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions shall be calculated using Equation 8.

              § 63.489
              Batch front-end process vents—monitoring equipment.
              (a) General requirements. Each owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream that uses a control device to comply with the requirements in § 63.487(a)(2) or § 63.487(b)(2) shall install the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to the manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
              (1) This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times when batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, that the owner or operator has selected to control are vented to the control device, or at all times when an aggregate batch vent stream is vented to the control device.
              (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the owner or operator shall operate control devices such that the daily average of monitored parameters, established as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, remains above the minimum level or below the maximum level, as appropriate.
              (b) Batch front-end process vent and aggregate batch vent stream monitoring equipment. The monitoring equipment specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section shall be installed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The parameters to be monitored are specified in Table 6 of this subpart.
              (1) Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
              (i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
              (ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.
              (2) Where a flare is used, a device (including, but not limited to, a thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required.
              (3) Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts design heat input capacity is used, a temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder is required. Any boiler or process heater in which all batch front-end process vents or aggregate batch vent streams are introduced with the primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel is exempt from this requirement.
              (4) Where a scrubber is used with an incinerator, boiler, or process heater in concert with the combustion of halogenated batch front-end process vents or halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, the following monitoring equipment is required for the scrubber:
              (i) A pH monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder to monitor the pH of the scrubber effluent; and

              (ii) A flow measurement device equipped with a continuous recorder shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas stream flow shall be determined using one of the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
              
              (A) The owner or operator may determine gas stream flow using the design blower capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.
              (B) If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 through 266 that have required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G) ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.
              (C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions. The plan shall include a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream flow, and a description of the records that will be maintained to document the determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator shall maintain the plan as specified in § 63.506(a).
              (5) Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device are required, each equipped with a continuous recorder.
              (6) Where a condenser is used, a condenser exit temperature (product side) monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
              (7) Where a carbon adsorber is used, an integrating regeneration steam flow, nitrogen flow, or pressure monitoring device having an accuracy of ±10 percent of the flow rate, level, or pressure, or better, capable of recording the total regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each regeneration cycle; and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device, capable of recording the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle are required.
              (8) As an alternate to paragraphs (b)(5) through (b)(7) of this section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder.
              (c) Alternative monitoring parameters. An owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream may request approval to monitor parameters other than those required by paragraph (b) of this section. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in § 63.492(e) and § 63.506(f). Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator:
              (1) Uses a control device other than those included in paragraph (b) of this section; or
              (2) Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (b) of this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those specified in Table 6 of this subpart and paragraph (b) of this section.
              (d) Monitoring of bypass lines. The owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream using a vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from a control device used to comply with § 63.487(a) or § 63.487(b) shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph (d).
              (1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.491(e)(3). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert emissions away from the control device and to the atmosphere; or

              (2) Secure the bypass line damper or valve in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the damper or valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and emissions are not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.491(e)(4).
              (e) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. Parameter monitoring levels for batch front-end process vents and aggregate batch vent streams shall be established as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section.
              (1) For each parameter monitored under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall establish a level, defined as either a maximum or minimum operating parameter as denoted in Table 7 of this subpart, that indicates proper operation of the control device. The level shall be established in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.505. The level may be based upon a prior performance test conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA, and the owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test under § 63.490, provided that the prior performance test meets the conditions of § 63.490(b)(3).
              (i) For batch front-end process vents using a control device to comply with § 63.487(a)(2), the established level shall reflect the control efficiency established as part of the initial compliance demonstration specified in § 63.490(c)(2).
              (ii) For aggregate batch vent streams using a control device to comply with § 63.487(b)(2), the established level shall reflect the emission reduction requirement of either 90 percent or 20 ppmv specified in § 63.487(b)(2).
              (2) The established level, along with supporting documentation, shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the operating permit application as required in § 63.506(e)(5) or § 63.506(e)(8), respectively.
              (3) The operating day shall be defined as part of establishing the parameter monitoring level and shall be submitted with the information in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The definition of operating day shall specify the time(s) at which an operating day begins and ends. The operating day shall not exceed 24 hours.

              § 63.490
              Batch front-end process vents—performance test methods and procedures to determine compliance.
              (a) Use of a flare. When a flare is used to comply with § 63.487(a)(1) or § 63.487(b)(1), the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with § 63.504(c).
              (b) Exceptions to performance tests. An owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test when a control device specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section is used to comply with § 63.487(a)(2).
              (1) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater.
              (2) A boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.
              (3) A control device for which a performance test was conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA and the test was conducted using the same Methods specified in this section and either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.
              (4) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator:
              (i) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or
              (ii) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.
              (5) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.
              (c) Batch front-end process vent testing and procedures for compliance with § 63.487(a)(2). Except as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, an owner or operator using a control device to comply with § 63.487(a)(2) shall conduct a performance test using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in order to determine the control efficiency of the control device. An owner or operator shall determine the percent reduction for the batch cycle using the control efficiency of the control device as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section and the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either total organic HAP or TOC. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term “batch emission episode” shall have the meaning “period of the batch emission episode selected for control,” which may be the entire batch emission episode or may only be a portion of the batch emission episode.
              (1) Performance tests shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(v) of this section.
              (i) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a test shall be performed for the entire period of each batch emission episode in the batch cycle that the owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 90 percent emission reduction for the batch cycle specified in § 63.487(a)(2). Only one test is required for each batch emission episode selected by the owner or operator for control. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B) through (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
              (A) Alternatively, an owner or operator may choose to test only those periods of the batch emission episode during which the emission rate for the entire episode can be determined or during which the emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used, provided the results are still relevant to the current batch front-end process vent conditions.

              (B) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is a pitot tube, except that references to particulate matter in Method 1A do not apply for the purposes of this subpart. No traverse is necessary when Method 2A or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is used to determine gas stream volumetric flow rate. Inlet sampling sites shall be located as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) and (c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section. Outlet sampling sites shall be located at the outlet of the final control device prior to release to the atmosphere.
              (1) The control device inlet sampling site shall be located at the exit from the batch unit operation before any control device. Section 63.488(a)(2) describes those recovery devices considered part of the unit operation. Inlet sampling sites would be after these specified recovery devices.
              (2) If a batch process vent is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP or TOC (minus methane and ethane) concentrations in all batch front-end process vents and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.
              (C) Gas stream volumetric flow rate and/or average batch vent flow rate shall be determined as specified in § 63.488(e).

              (D) Method 18 or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the concentration of organic HAP or TOC, as appropriate. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(D)(1) and (c)(1)(i)(D)(2) of this section.
              (1) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
              (2) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
              (ii) If an integrated sample is taken over the entire batch emission episode to determine the average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equations 18 and 19.

              (1) Sampling sites shall be located at the inlet and outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device used to reduce halogen emissions in complying with § 63.487(c)(1) or at the outlet of the halogen reduction device used to reduce halogen emissions in complying with § 63.487(c)(2).
              (2) The mass emissions of each hydrogen halide and halogen compound for the batch cycle or aggregate batch vent stream shall be calculated from the measured concentrations and the gas stream flow rate(s) determined by the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
              (i) Method 26 or Method 26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the concentration, in Mg per dry scm, of total hydrogen halides and halogens present in the emissions stream.
              (ii) Gas stream volumetric flow rate and/or average batch vent flow rate shall be determined as specified in § 63.488(e).
              (3) To determine compliance with the percent reduction specified in § 63.487(c)(1), the mass emissions for any hydrogen halides and halogens present at the inlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device shall be summed together. The mass emissions of any hydrogen halides or halogens present at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device shall be summed together. Percent reduction shall be determined by subtracting the outlet mass emissions from the inlet mass emissions and then dividing the result by the inlet mass emissions and multiplying by 100.
              (4) To determine compliance with the emission limit specified in § 63.487(c)(2), the annual mass emissions for any hydrogen halides and halogens present at the outlet of the halogen reduction device and prior to any combustion device shall be summed together and compared to the emission limit specified in § 63.487(c)(2).
              (5) The owner or operator may use any other method to demonstrate compliance if the method or data has been validated according to the applicable procedures of Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.
              (e) Aggregate batch vent stream testing for compliance with § 63.487(b)(2). Except as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section, owners or operators of aggregate batch vent streams complying with § 63.487(b)(2) shall conduct a performance test using the performance testing procedures for continuous front-end process vents in § 63.116(c).
              (1) For the purposes of this subpart, when the provisions of § 63.116(c) specify that Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
              (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.

              (2) When § 63.116(c)(4) refers to complying with an emission reduction of 98 percent, for the purposes of this subpart, the 90 percent reduction requirement specified in § 63.487(b)(2) shall apply.
              (3) When a combustion device is used to comply with the 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration standard specified in § 63.487(b)(2), the correction to 3 percent oxygen specified in the performance testing procedures of § 63.116(c)(3) and (c)(3)(iii) is only required when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, for the purposes of this subpart.
              (f) Batch mass input limitation. The batch mass input limitation required by § 63.487(g)(1) shall be determined by the owner or operator such that annual emissions for the batch front-end process vent remain less than the level specified in § 63.488(d). The batch mass input limitation required by § 63.487(f)(1) shall be determined by the owner or operator such that annual emissions remain at a level that ensures that the batch front-end process vent remains a Group 2 batch front-end process vent, given the actual annual flow rate for that batch front-end process vent determined according to § 63.488(e)(3). The batch mass input limitation shall be determined using the same basis, as described in § 63.488(a)(1), used to make the group determination (i.e., expected mix of products or highest-HAP recipe). The establishment of the batch mass input limitation is not dependent upon any past production or activity level.
              (1) If the expected mix of products serves as the basis for the batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be determined based on any foreseeable combination of products that the owner or operator expects to manufacture.
              (2) If the single highest-HAP recipe serves as the basis for the batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be determined based solely on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation.

              (8) If the total annual emissions from the batch front-end process vent during the group determination are less than the appropriate level specified in § 63.488(d), only the records in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section are required.
              (9) For each Group 2 batch front-end process vent that is exempt from the batch mass input limitation provisions because it meets the criteria of § 63.487(h), the records specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (ii) shall be maintained.
              (i) Documentation of the maximum design capacity of the EPPU; and
              (ii) The mass of HAP or material that can be charged annually to the batch unit operation at the maximum design capacity.

              Back-end process provisions—carbon disulfide limitations for styrene butadiene rubber by emulsion processes.
              (a) Owners or operators of sources subject to this subpart producing styrene butadiene rubber using an emulsion process shall operate the process such that the carbon disulfide concentration in each crumb dryer exhausts shall not exceed 45 ppmv.

              (1) The owner or operator shall develop standard operating procedures for the addition of sulfur containing shortstop agents to ensure that the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section is maintained. There shall be a standard operating procedure representing the production of every grade of styrene butadiene rubber produced at the affected source using a sulfur containing shortstop agent.
              
              (2) A validation of each standard operating procedure shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, to demonstrate compliance with the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (3) The owner or operator shall operate the process in accordance with a validated standard operating procedure at all times when styrene butadiene rubber is being produced using a sulfur containing shortstop agent. If a standard operating procedure is changed, it shall be re-validated.
              (4) Records specified in paragraph (d) of this section shall be maintained.
              (5) Reports shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
              (b) Crumb dryers that are vented to a combustion device are not subject to the provisions in this section.
              (c) The owner or operator shall validate each standard operating procedure to determine compliance with the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section using the testing procedures in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or engineering assessment, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator may choose to conduct a performance test, using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the carbon disulfide concentration limitation in paragraph (a) of this section. One test shall be conducted for each standard operating procedure.
              (i) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as required, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites.
              (ii) The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as required.
              (iii) To determine compliance with the carbon disulfide concentration limit in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall use Method 18 or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure carbon disulfide. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. The following procedures shall be used to calculate carbon disulfide concentration:
              (A) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour, in which either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15 minute intervals during the run.
              (B) The concentration of carbon disulfide shall be calculated using Equation 32.

              § 63.503
              Emissions averaging provisions.
              (a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing affected sources who seek to comply with § 63.483(b) by using emissions averaging rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.494, and 63.501.
              (1) The following emission point limitations apply to the use of these provisions:
              (i) All emission points included in an emissions average shall be from the same affected source. There may be an emissions average for each individual affected source located at a plant site.

              (ii)(A) If a plant site has only one affected source for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed to be included in the emission average is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions average.
              
              (B) If a plant site has two or more affected sources for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed in the emissions average for those affected sources is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions averages.
              (2) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be based on either organic HAP or TOC.
              (3) For the purposes of the provisions in this section, whenever Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is specified within the paragraphs of this section or is specified by reference through provisions outside this section, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
              (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
              (b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Emissions Averaging Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.506(e)(4) for all emission points to be included in an emissions average.
              (c) Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section describe the emission points that may be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section discusses the use of pollution prevention in generating emissions averaging credits.
              (1) Storage vessels, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, continuous front-end process vents, and process wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 2 emission points.
              (2) Storage vessels, continuous front-end process vents, and process wastewater steams that are determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies shall be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (3) Batch front-end process vents and aggregate batch vent streams that are determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled to a level more stringent than the applicable standard.
              (4) Back-end process operations that are controlled such that organic HAP emissions from the back-end process operation are less than would be achieved by meeting the residual organic HAP limits in § 63.494. For the purposes of the emission averaging provisions in this section, all back-end process operations at an affected facility shall be considered a single emission point.
              (5) The percent reduction for any storage vessel, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous front-end process vent, and process wastewater stream shall be determined using the procedures specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (i) For a Group 1 storage vessel, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous front-end process vent, or process wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure shall reduce emissions more than if the reference control technology or standard had been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.

              (ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 storage vessel, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous front-end process vent, or process wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology or standard, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls shall reduce emissions more than if the applicable reference control technology or standard had been applied instead of the pollution prevention measure.
              (d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:
              (1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 cannot be used to generate credits unless the level of control was increased after November 15, 1990. In this case, credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.
              (2) Group 1 emission points, identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that are controlled by a reference control technology cannot be used to generate credits unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (3) Emission points on nonoperating EPPU cannot be used to generate credits. EPPU that are shutdown cannot be used to generate credits or debits.
              (4) Maintenance wastewater cannot be used to generate credits. Wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units cannot be used to generate credits. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.
              (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart cannot be used to generate credits, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 to a level above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the emission point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the emission point may continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved emissions average.
              (e) For all emission points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform the following tasks:
              (1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology or standard for those emission points. The Group 1 emission points are identified in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.
              (2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 and Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.
              (3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator may choose to include more than the required number of credit-generating emission points in an emissions average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.
              (ii) The initial demonstration in the Emissions Averaging Plan or operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points shall be made under representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data shall be used for all debit and credit calculations.

              (4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.

              (5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.506(e)(6). Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.506(e)(6)(x)(C)(2).
              (f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions during the following periods:
              (1) [Reserved]
              (2) Emissions during periods of monitoring excursions, as defined in § 63.505 (g) or (h). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
              (i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.
              (ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.
              (iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section.
              (g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the applicable reference control technology or standard and the emissions allowed for the Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:
              (1) Source-wide debits shall be calculated using Equation 33. Debits and all terms of the equation are in units of megagrams per month (Mg/month):

                Cj = Concentration, ppmv, dry basis, of organic HAP j as measured by Method 18 or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
                Mj = Molecular weight of organic HAP j, gram per gram-mole.
                n = Number of organic HAP in stream.
              
              
              (A) The values of Q and Cj shall be determined during a performance test conducted under representative operating conditions. The values of Q and Cj shall be established in the Notification of Compliance Status and shall be updated as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

              (B) If there is a change in capacity utilization other than a change in monthly operating hours, or if any other change is made to the process or product recovery equipment or operation such that the previously measured values of Q and Cj are no longer representative, a new performance test shall be conducted to determine new representative values of Q and Cj. These new values shall be used to calculate debits and credits from the time of the change forward, and the new values shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.

              (iii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to calculate ECFEPViACTUAL:

              (A) If the continuous front-end process vent is not controlled by a control device or pollution prevention measure, ECFEPViACTUAL = ECFEPViu, where ECFEPViu is calculated according to the procedures contained in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

              (B) If the continuous front-end process vent is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 98-percent reduction, ECFEPViACTUAL is calculated using Equation 35.
              
                ER05SE96.033
              
              
                Where:

              (1) The percent reduction shall be measured according to the procedures in § 63.116 if a combustion control device is used. For a flare meeting the criteria in § 63.116(a), or a boiler or process heater meeting the criteria in § 63.116(b), the percent reduction shall be 98 percent. If a noncombustion control device is used, percent reduction shall be demonstrated by a performance test at the inlet and outlet of the device, or, if testing is not feasible, by a control design evaluation and documented engineering calculations.
              (2) For determining debits from Group 1 continuous front-end process vents, product recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and shall not be assigned a percent reduction in calculating ECFEPViACTUAL. The sampling site for measurement of uncontrolled emissions shall be after the final uncontrolled recovery device. However, as provided in § 63.113(a)(3), a Group 1 continuous front-end process vent may add sufficient product recovery to raise the TRE index value above 1.0, thereby becoming a Group 2 continuous front-end process vent. Such a continuous front-end process vent is not a Group 1 continuous front-end process vent and should, therefore, not be included in determining debits under this paragraph.
              (3) Procedures for calculating the percent reduction of pollution prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (3) Emissions from storage vessels shall be calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.150(g)(3).

              (6) Emissions from batch front-end process vents shall be calculated as follows:
              (i) EBFEPViu for each batch front-end process vent i shall be calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.488(b).

              (ii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to determine EBFEPViACTUAL:

              (A) If the batch front-end process vent is not controlled by a control device or pollution prevention measure, EBFEPViACTUAL = EBFEPViu, where EBFEPViu is calculated according to the procedures in § 63.488(b).

              (B) If the batch front-end process vent is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 90 percent reduction for the batch cycle, calculate EBFEPViACTUAL using Equation 38, where percent reduction is for the batch cycle.
              
                ER05SE96.035
              
              (1) The percent reduction for the batch cycle shall be measured according to the procedures in § 63.490(c)(2).
              (2) The percent reduction for control devices shall be calculated according to the procedures in § 63.490 (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii).

              (i) For purposes of determining aggregate batch vent stream flow rate, organic HAP concentrations, and temperature, the sampling site shall be before any control device and before discharge to the atmosphere. Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used for selection of the sampling site.
              (ii) EABViu for each aggregate batch vent i shall be calculated using Equation 39.
              
                ER05SE96.036

              (3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days of the submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish a Federal Register notice establishing a nominal efficiency for the control technology.
              (4) The Administrator may grant permission to take emission credits for use of the control technology. The Administrator may also impose requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the specified nominal efficiency.

              (ii) If, in reviewing the application, the permitting authority believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other sources, the permitting authority shall submit the information provided in the application to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall review the technology for broad applicability and may publish a Federal Register notice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting authority's approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology for the specific application.
              (6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines that the control technology is not different in use or design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny the application.
              (j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures for storage vessels, continuous front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, and wastewater streams:
              (1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice which meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions, while the same product is produced.
              (ii) Pollution prevention measures may include substitution of feedstocks that reduce organic HAP emissions; alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.
              (2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990, may be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
              (i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction is used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(7) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section is the percent difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.
              (ii) Equation 52 shall be used to calculate the percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.
              
                ER05SE96.049
              
              
                where:
                
                Percent reduction = Efficiency of pollution prevention measure (percent organic HAP reduction).
                EB = Monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, Mg/month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A), (j)(2)(ii)(B), and (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
                Epp = Monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, Mg/month, as determined for the most recent month, determined as specified in either paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) or (j)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.
                PB = Monthly production before the pollution prevention measure, Mg/month, during the same period over which EB is calculated.
                Ppp = Monthly production after the pollution prevention measure, Mg/month, as determined for the most recent month.
              
              

              (A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, EB, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the equations and procedures in paragraph (g)(2) of this section for continuous front-end process vents, paragraph (g)(3) of this section for storage vessels, paragraph (g)(6) of this section for batch front-end process vents, and paragraph (g)(7) of this section for aggregate batch vent streams.
              (B) For wastewater, EB shall be calculated according to § 63.150(j)(2)(ii)(B).

              (C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to September 5, 1996, records may be used to determine E B.

              (D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, Epp, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio may be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.
              (E) For wastewater, Epp shall be calculated according to § 63.150(j)(2)(ii)(E).
              (iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.
              (iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in emissions for each emission point shall be calculated.
              (v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section, used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology or standard, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of an affected source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
              (k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the emissions average will not result in greater hazard, or at the option of the Administrator, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.493, and 63.501.
              (1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
              (i) The Administrator may require owners and operators to use specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk determination.
              (ii) The demonstration and approval of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made according to any guidance that the Administrator makes available for use.
              (2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their operating permit application or in their Emissions Averaging Plan if an operating permit application has not yet been submitted.
              (3) An Emissions Averaging Plan that does not demonstrate hazard or risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the Emissions Averaging Plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the emissions average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.493, and 63.501.
              (4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall:
              (i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
              (ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and
              (iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such demonstrations.
              (l) For periods of monitoring excursions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of monitoring excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.506(e)(6).

              (2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures for demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.
              (3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the excursion and the other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.
              (4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.
              (m) For each emission point included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting equivalent to that required for Group 1 emission points complying with §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.493, and 63.501, as applicable. If back-end process operations are included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting equivalent to that required for back-end process operations complying with § 63.493. The specific requirements for continuous front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, storage vessels, back-end process operations, and wastewater are identified in paragraphs (m)(1) through (m)(6) of this section.

              (4) For back-end process operations included in an emissions average:
              (i) If stripping technology, and no control or recovery device, is used to reduce back-end process operation emissions, the owner or operator shall implement the following portions of this subpart:
              (A) Paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of § 63.495, paragraph (b) of § 63.498, and the applicable provisions of § 63.499, or
              (B) Paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of § 63.495, paragraph (c) of § 63.498, and the applicable provisions of § 63.499;

              § 63.504
              Additional requirements for performance testing.
              (a) Performance testing shall be conducted in accordance with § 63.7(a)(1), (a)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), (g), and (h), with the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section and the additions specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Sections 63.484 through 63.501 also contain specific testing requirements.
              (1) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions achievable during one of the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, without causing any of the situations described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section to occur. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (i) The 6-month period that ends 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status is due, according to § 63.506(e)(5); or the 6-month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3 months after the performance test.
              (ii) Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make product in excess of demand.
              (2) References in § 63.7(g) to the Notification of Compliance Status requirements in § 63.9(h) shall refer to the requirements in § 63.506(e)(5).
              (3) Because the site-specific test plans in § 63.7(c)(3) are not required, § 63.7(h)(4)(ii) is not applicable.

              (4) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the intent to conduct a performance test at least 30 days before the performance test is scheduled, to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
              (5) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), rather than according to the time periods in § 63.7(a)(2).
              (b) Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA approved methods specified in the applicable subpart or, if other test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the protocol in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.
              (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, if an owner or operator of an affected source uses a flare to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. The owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet organic HAP or TOC concentration. If a compliance demonstration has been conducted previously for a flare, using the techniques specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, that compliance demonstration may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if either no deliberate process changes have been made since the compliance demonstration, or the results of the compliance demonstration reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.
              (1) Conduct a visible emission test using the techniques specified in § 63.11(b)(4);
              (2) Determine the net heating value of the gas being combusted, using the techniques specified in § 63.11(b)(6); and
              (3) Determine the exit velocity using the techniques specified in either § 63.11(b)(7)(i) (and § 63.11(b)(7)(iii), where applicable) or § 63.11(b)(8), as appropriate.

              § 63.505
              Parameter monitoring levels and excursions.
              (a) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or operator of a control or recovery device that has one or more parameter monitoring level requirements specified under this subpart shall establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured parameter. If a performance test is required by this subpart for a control device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a performance test is not required by this subpart for a control device, the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring levels. When using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in § 63.506(e)(3)(vii) for review and approval, as part of the Precompliance Report.
              (1) The owner or operator shall operate control and recovery devices such that the daily average of monitored parameters remains above the minimum established level or below the maximum established level, except as otherwise stated in this subpart.
              (2) As specified in § 63.506(e)(5), all established levels, along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of Compliance Status.
              (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable provisions of subpart A, F, G, or H of this part.
              (b) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively on performance tests. In cases where a performance test is required by this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively on parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, as applicable.
              (1) [Reserved]
              (2) Back-end process operations using a control or recovery device to comply with §§ 63.493 through 63.500 and continuous front-end process vents. During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously monitored during the required 1-hour runs. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a minimum level.
              (3) Batch front-end process vents. The monitoring level(s) shall be established using the procedures specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The procedures specified in this paragraph (b)(3) may only be used if the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected to be controlled were tested, and monitoring data were collected, during the entire period in which emissions were vented to the control device, as specified in § 63.490(c)(1)(i). If the owner or operator chose to test only a portion of the batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled, the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section shall be used.
              (i) If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:
              (A) The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values measured during the required performance test.
              (B) If the level to be established is a maximum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average parameter values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the lowest parameter value in order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).
              (C) If the level to be established is a minimum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average parameter values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the highest parameter value in order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).
              (D) Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values measured during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled.
              (ii) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be determined as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
              (iii) The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of Compliance Status, as specified in § 63.506(e)(5). The definition shall include an identification of each batch emission episode and the information required to determine parameter monitoring compliance for partial batch cycles (i.e., when part of a batch cycle is accomplished during two different operating days).
              (4) Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams, the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (c) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a performance test is required by this subpart, or the owner or operator elects to do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and the owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (c), the owner or operator shall supplement the parameter values measured during the performance test with engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values.
              (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a performance test is not required by this subpart and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (d), the determination of the parameter monitoring level shall be based exclusively on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.
              (e) Demonstration of compliance with back-end process provisions using stripper parameter monitoring. If the owner or operator is demonstrating compliance with § 63.495 using stripper parameter monitoring, stripper parameter levels shall be established for each grade in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section. A single set of stripper parameter levels may be representative of multiple grades.
              (1) For each grade, the owner or operator shall calculate the residual organic HAP content using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The location of the sampling shall be in accordance with § 63.495(d).
              (ii) The residual organic HAP content in each sample is to be determined using Methods specified in § 63.495(e).
              (2) For each grade, the owner or operator shall establish stripper operating parameter levels that represent stripper operation during the residual organic HAP content determination in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The stripper operating parameters shall include, at a minimum, temperature, pressure, steaming rates (for steam strippers), and some parameter that is indicative of residence time.
              (3) After the initial determinations, an owner or operator may add a grade, with corresponding stripper parameter levels, using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section. The results of this determination shall be submitted in the next periodic report.
              (4) An owner or operator complying with the residual organic HAP limitations in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of § 63.494 using stripping, and demonstrating compliance by stripper parameter monitoring, shall redetermine the residual organic HAP content for all affected grades whenever process changes are made. For the purposes of this section, a process change is any action that would reasonably be expected to impair the performance of the stripping operation. For the purposes of this section, examples of process changes may include changes in production capacity or production rate, or removal or addition of equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, process changes do not include: Process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; or changes that reduce the residual organic HAP content of the elastomer.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Parameter monitoring excursion definitions. (1) With respect to storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring plan specifies continuous monitoring), continuous front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, back-end process operations complying with § 63.494(a)(1) through (3) through the use of control or recovery devices, and process wastewater streams, an excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.

              (ii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section, to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
              (iii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section, is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than two of the hours during the period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section.
              (iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data compression systems approved under § 63.506(g)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made during the hour.
              (v) The periods listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(v)(A) through (g)(1)(v)(E) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of control or recovery device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (A) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or
              (B) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.
              (2) With respect to batch front-end process vents, an excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in either paragraph (g)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (i) When the batch cycle daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the given parameters.
              (ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device during the operating day, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(A) through (g)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.
              (A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device.
              (B) Subtract the time during the periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments from the total amount of time determined in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, to obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient.
              (1) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
              (2) Start-ups;
              (3) Shutdowns; or
              (4) Malfunctions.
              (C) Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
              (D) If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for the operating day.

              (3) For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria, this is considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              
              (i) If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) or (g)(3)(i)(B) of this section is considered a single excursion for the control device.
              (A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over the duration of the filling period for the storage vessel, is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.
              (B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded, according to the storage vessel's monitoring plan, during the filling period for the storage vessel.
              (ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating requirement.
              (h) Excursion definitions for back-end operations complying through stripping. (1) With respect to back-end process operations complying through the use of stripping technology, and demonstrating compliance by sampling, an excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and (h)(1)(ii) of this section. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (i) When the monthly weighted average residual organic HAP content is above the applicable residual organic HAP limitation in § 63.494; or
              (ii) When less than 75 percent of the samples required in 1 month are taken and analyzed in accordance with the provisions of § 63.495(b).
              (2) With respect to back-end process operations complying through the use of stripping technology, and demonstrating compliance by stripper parameter monitoring, an excursion means one of the three cases listed in paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (h)(2)(ii), and (h)(2)(iii) of this section. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (i) When the monthly weighted average residual organic HAP content is above the applicable residual organic HAP limitation in § 63.494;
              (ii) When an owner or operator fails to sample and analyze the organic HAP content of a sample for a grade with an hourly average stripper operating parameter value not in accordance with the established monitoring parameter levels for that parameter; or
              (iii) When an owner or operator does not collect sufficient monitoring data for at least 75 percent of the grades or batches processed during a month. Stripper monitoring data are considered insufficient if monitoring parameters are obtained for less than 75 percent of the 15-minute periods during the processing of a grade, and a sample of that grade or batch is not taken and analyzed to determine the residual organic HAP content.
              (i) Excused excursions. A number of excused excursions shall be allowed for each control or recovery device for each semiannual period. The number of excused excursions for each semiannual period is specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(6) of this section. This paragraph applies to affected sources required to submit Periodic Reports semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-month period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
              (1) For the first semiannual period—six excused excursions.
              (2) For the second semiannual period—five excused excursions.
              (3) For the third semiannual period—four excused excursions.
              (4) For the fourth semiannual period—three excused excursions.
              (5) For the fifth semiannual period—two excused excursions.
              (6) For the sixth and all subsequent semiannual periods—one excused excursion.
              (j) Excursion definition for back-end operations subject to § 63.494(a)(4). An excursion means when the total mass of organic HAP emitted for any consecutive 12-month period divided by the total mass of elastomer produced during the 12-month period, determined in accordance with § 63.495(g), is greater than the applicable emission limitation, determined in accordance with § 63.494(a)(4)(i) through (iv) and submitted in accordance with § 63.499(f)(1).
              [62 FR 46925, Sept. 5, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 11547, Mar. 9, 1999; 65 FR 38074, June 19, 2000; 76 FR 22592, Apr. 21, 2011]
            
            
              § 63.506
              General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.
              (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on microfilm, computer, floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
              (2) If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of § 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those reports.
              (b) Subpart A requirements. The owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A as specified in Table 1 of this subpart. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
              (1) Malfunction records. Each owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart shall maintain records of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (i.e., process equipment), air pollution control equipment, or monitoring equipment. Each owner or operator shall maintain records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.483(a)(1), including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.
              (i) Records of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section.
              (A) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or control devices or recovery devices or continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this subpart during which excess emissions (as defined in § 63.480(j)(4)) occur.
              (B) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess emissions (as defined in § 63.480(j)(4)) occur, records reflecting whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing a control device to a backup control device, records shall be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
              (C) Records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section are not required if they pertain solely to Group 2 emission points that are not included in an emissions average.
              (ii) Reports of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. For the purposes of this subpart, the semiannual start-up, shutdown, and malfunction reports shall be submitted on the same schedule as the Periodic Reports required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section instead of the schedule specified in § 63.10(d)(5)(i). The reports shall include the information specified in § 63.10(d)(5)(i).
              (2) Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. For new affected sources, each owner or operator shall comply with the provisions in § 63.5 regarding construction and reconstruction, excluding the provisions specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(2), and (d)(3)(ii).
              (c) [Reserved]
              (d) Recordkeeping and documentation. Owners or operators required to keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section, unless an alternative recordkeeping system has been requested and approved as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to § 63.484(k) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section apply. As described in § 63.484(k), certain storage vessels are not required to keep continuous records as specified in this paragraph. Owners and operators of such storage vessels shall keep records as specified in the monitoring plan required by § 63.484(k). Paragraphs (d)(8) and (d)(9) of this section specify documentation requirements.
              (1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once every 15 minutes.
              (2) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average instead of all measured values. Owners or operators of batch front-end process vents shall record each measured data value.
              (3) Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for each operating day as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(ii) of this section, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this section.
              (i) The daily average value or batch cycle daily average shall be calculated as the average of all parameter values recorded during the operating day, except as specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. For batch front-end process vents, as specified in § 63.491(e)(2)(i), only parameter values measured during those batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that the owner or operator has chosen to control shall be used to calculate the average. The calculated average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous.
              (ii) The operating day shall be the period that the owner or operator specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status for purposes of determining daily average values or batch cycle daily average values of monitored parameters.
              (4)-(5) [Reserved]
              (6) Records required when all recorded values are within the established limits. If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and recording a daily average (or batch cycle daily average) for that operating day.
              (7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (d)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process or control device or recovery device operation when monitors are not operating.
              (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or

              (ii) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.
              
              (8) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this subpart, records documenting the completion of calibration checks, and records documenting the maintenance of continuous monitoring systems that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or that are specified in other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
              (9) The owner or operator of an affected source granted a waiver under § 63.10(f) shall maintain the information, if any, specified by the Administrator as a condition of the waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
              (e) Reporting and notification. In addition to the reports and notifications required by subpart A, as specified in Table 1 of this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall prepare and submit the reports listed in paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(8) of this section, as applicable. All reports required by this subpart, and the schedule for their submittal, are listed in Table 9 of this subpart.
              (1) Owners and operators shall not be in violation of the reporting requirements of this subpart for failing to submit information required to be included in a specified report if the owner or operator meets the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this section. Examples of circumstances where this paragraph may apply include information related to newly-added equipment or emission points, changes in the process, changes in equipment required or utilized for compliance with the requirements of this subpart, or changes in methods or equipment for monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting.
              (i) The information was not known in time for inclusion in the report specified by this subpart;
              (ii) The owner or operator has been diligent in obtaining the information; and
              (iii) The owner or operator submits a report according to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(A) through (e)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.
              (A) If this subpart expressly provides for supplements to the report in which the information is required, the owner or operator shall submit the information as a supplement to that report. The information shall be submitted no later than 60 days after it is obtained, unless otherwise specified in this subpart.
              (B) If this subpart does not expressly provide for supplements, but the owner or operator must submit a request for revision of an operating permit pursuant to part 70 or part 71, due to circumstances to which the information pertains, the owner or operator shall submit the information with the request for revision to the operating permit.
              (C) In any case not addressed by paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) or (e)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information with the first Periodic Report, as required by this subpart, which has a submission deadline at least 60 days after the information is obtained.
              (2) All reports required under this subpart shall be sent to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13. If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, reports may be submitted on electronic media.
              (3) Precompliance Report. Owners or operators of affected sources requesting an extension for compliance; requesting approval to use alternative monitoring parameters, alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping, or alternative controls; requesting approval to use engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, as described in § 63.488(b)(6)(i); wishing to establish parameter monitoring levels according to the procedures contained in § 63.505(c) or (d); shall submit a Precompliance Report according to the schedule described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The Precompliance Report shall contain the information specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) through (vii) of this section, as appropriate.
              (i) Submittal dates. The Precompliance Report shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than December 19, 2000. If a Precompliance Report was submitted prior to June 19, 2000 and no changes need to be made to that Precompliance Report, the owner or operator shall re-submit the earlier report or submit notification that the previously submitted report is still valid. Unless the Administrator objects to a request submitted in the Precompliance Report within 45 days after its receipt, the request shall be deemed approved. For new affected sources, the Precompliance Report shall be submitted to the Administrator with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Supplements to the Precompliance Report may be submitted as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ix) of this section.
              (ii) A request for an extension for compliance, as specified in § 63.481(e), may be submitted in the Precompliance Report. The request for a compliance extension shall include the data outlined in § 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D), as required in § 63.481(e)(1).
              (iii) The alternative monitoring parameter information required in paragraph (f) of this section shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report if, for any emission point, the owner or operator of an affected source seeks to comply through the use of a control technique other than those for which monitoring parameters are specified in this subpart or in subpart G of this part, or seeks to comply by monitoring a different parameter than those specified in this subpart or in subpart G of this part.
              (iv) If the affected source seeks to comply using alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit a request for approval in the Precompliance Report.
              (v) The owner or operator shall report the intent to use alternative controls to comply with the provisions of this subpart in the Precompliance Report. The Administrator may deem alternative controls to be equivalent to the controls required by the standard, under the procedures outlined in § 63.6(g).
              (vi) If a request for approval to use engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, as described in § 63.488(b)(6)(i)(C) is being made, the information required by § 63.488(b)(6)(iii)(B) shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report.
              (vii) If an owner or operator establishes parameter monitoring levels according to the procedures contained in § 63.505(c) or (d), the following information shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report:
              (A) Identification of which procedures (i.e., § 63.505(c) or (d)) are to be used; and
              (B) A description of how the parameter monitoring level is to be established. If the procedures in § 63.505(c) are to be used, a description of how performance test data will be used shall be included.
              (viii) [Reserved]
              (ix) Supplements to the Precompliance Report may be submitted as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ix)(A), or (e)(3)(ix)(B) of this section. Unless the Administrator objects to a request submitted in a supplement to the Precompliance Report within 45 days after its receipt, the request shall be deemed approved.
              (A) Supplements to the Precompliance Report may be submitted to clarify or modify information previously submitted.
              (B) Supplements to the Precompliance Report may be submitted to request approval to use alternative monitoring parameters, as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section; to use alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping, as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section; to use alternative controls, as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section; to use engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section; or to establish parameter monitoring levels according to the procedures contained in § 63.505(c) or (d), as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section.
              (4) Emissions Averaging Plan. For all existing affected sources using emissions averaging, an Emissions Averaging Plan shall be submitted for approval according to the schedule and procedures described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. The Emissions Averaging Plan shall contain the information specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, unless the information required in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section is submitted with an operating permit application. An owner or operator of an affected source who submits an operating permit application instead of an Emissions Averaging Plan shall submit the information specified in paragraph (e)(8) of this section. In addition, a supplement to the Emissions Averaging Plan, as required under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section, is to be submitted whenever additional alternative controls or operating scenarios may be used to comply with this subpart. Updates to the Emissions Averaging Plan shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section.
              (i) Submittal and approval. The Emissions Averaging Plan shall be submitted no later than September 19, 2000, and is subject to Administrator approval. If an Emissions Averaging Plan was submitted prior to June 19, 2000 and no changes need to be made to that Emissions Averaging Plan, the owner or operator shall re-submit the earlier plan or submit notification that the previously submitted plan is still valid. The Administrator shall determine within 120 days whether the Emissions Averaging Plan submitted presents sufficient information. The Administrator shall either approve the Emissions Averaging Plan, request changes, or request that the owner or operator submit additional information. Once the Administrator receives sufficient information, the Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or request changes to the plan within 120 days.
              (ii) Information required. The Emissions Averaging Plan shall contain the information listed in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(A) through (e)(4)(ii)(N) of this section for all emission points included in an emissions average.
              (A) The required information shall include the identification of all emission points and process back-end operations in the planned emissions average and, where applicable, notation of whether each storage vessel, continuous front-end process vent, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vents stream, and process wastewater stream is a Group 1 or Group 2 emission point, as defined in § 63.482 or as designated under § 63.503(c)(2).
              (B) The required information shall include the projected emission debits and credits for each emission point and the sum for the emission points involved in the average calculated according to § 63.503. The projected credits shall be greater than or equal to the projected debits, as required under § 63.503(e)(3).
              (C) The required information shall include the specific control technology or pollution prevention measure that will be used for each emission point included in the average and date of application or expected date of application.
              (D) The required information shall include the specific identification of each emission point affected by a pollution prevention measure. To be considered a pollution prevention measure, the criteria in § 63.503(j)(1) shall be met. If the same pollution prevention measure reduces or eliminates emissions from multiple emission points in the average, the owner or operator shall identify each of these emission points.
              (E) The required information shall include a statement that the compliance demonstration, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions in § 63.503(m), (n), and (o) that are applicable to each emission point in the emissions average will be implemented beginning on or before the date of compliance.

              (F) The required information shall include documentation of the data listed in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(F)(1) through (e)(4)(ii)(F)(5) of this section for each storage vessel and continuous front-end process vent included in the average.
              (1) The required documentation shall include the values of the parameters used to determine whether the emission point is Group 1 or Group 2. Where a TRE index value is used for continuous front-end process vent group determination, the estimated or measured values of the parameters used in the TRE equation in § 63.115(d) and the resulting TRE index value shall be submitted.
              
              (2) The required documentation shall include the estimated values of all parameters needed for input to the emission debit and credit calculations in § 63.503(g) and (h). These parameter values shall be specified in the affected source's Emissions Averaging Plan (or operating permit) as enforceable operating conditions. Changes to these parameters shall be reported in an update to the Emissions Averaging Plan, as required by paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B)(2) of this section.
              (3) The required documentation shall include the estimated percent reduction if a control technology achieving a lower percent reduction than the efficiency of the applicable reference control technology or standard is or will be applied to the emission point.

              (ii) The information specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, Precompliance Report, as applicable.
              (f) Alternative monitoring parameters. The owner or operator of an affected source who has been directed by any section of this subpart, or any section of another subpart referenced by this subpart, that expressly references this paragraph (f) or § 63.151(f) to set unique monitoring parameters, or who requests approval to monitor a different parameter than those listed in § 63.484 for storage vessels, § 63.114 for continuous front-end process vents, § 63.489 for batch front-end process vents and aggregate batch vent streams, § 63.497 for back-end process operations, or § 63.143 for process wastewater shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section in the Precompliance Report, as required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record required by paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.
              (1) The required information shall include a description of the parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the recovery device, control device, or pollution prevention measure is operated in conformance with its design and achieves the specified emission limit, percent reduction, or nominal efficiency, and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).
              (2) The required information shall include a description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter indicates proper operation, the schedule for this demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish a level for the monitored parameter as part of the Notification of Compliance Status report required in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, unless this information has already been included in the operating permit application.
              (3) The required information shall include a description of the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system, to include the frequency and content of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. Further, the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system shall be included if either condition in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section is met:
              (i) If monitoring and recordkeeping is not continuous, or
              (ii) If reports of daily average values will not be included in Periodic Reports when the monitored parameter value is above the maximum level or below the minimum level as established in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status.
              (g) Alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping. An owner or operator choosing not to implement the continuous parameter operating and recordkeeping provisions listed in § 63.485 for continuous front-end process vents, § 63.486 for batch front-end process vents and aggregate batch vent streams, § 63.493 for back-end process operations, and § 63.501 for process wastewater, may instead request approval to use alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section. Requests shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, if not already included in the operating permit application, and shall contain the information specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (1) The provisions in § 63.8(f)(5)(i) shall govern the review and approval of requests.
              (2) An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter values at least once every 15 minutes and that does not generate continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system with less frequent monitoring, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The requested system shall include manual reading and recording of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than once per hour. Daily average or batch cycle daily average values shall be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.
              (ii) The request shall contain:
              (A) A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping system;
              (B) Documentation that the affected source does not have an automated monitoring and recording system;
              (C) Justification for requesting an alternative monitoring and recordkeeping system; and

              (D) Demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction that the proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or recovery device operating conditions, considering typical variability of the specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter being monitored.
              (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated data compression recording system that does not record monitored operating parameter values at a set frequency, but that records all values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The requested system shall be designed to:
              (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during every 15 minute period;
              (B) Except for the monitoring of batch front-end process vents, record at least four values each hour during periods of operation;
              (C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
              (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
              (E) Calculate daily average or batch cycle daily average values of the monitored operating parameter based on all measured data; and
              (F) If the daily average is not an excursion, as defined in § 63.505 (g) or (h), the data for that operating day may be converted to hourly average values and the four or more individual records for each hour in the operating day may be discarded.
              (ii) The request shall contain:
              (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression recording system, including the criteria used to determine which monitored values are recorded and retained;
              (B) The method for calculating daily averages and batch cycle daily averages; and
              (C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
              (4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in § 63.8(f)(4).
              (h) Reduced recordkeeping program. For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section as alternatives to the continuous operating parameter monitoring and recordkeeping provisions that would otherwise apply under this subpart. The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record required by paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average or the batch cycle daily average value, and is not required to retain more frequent monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(vi) of this section are met. An owner or operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(xii) of this section, or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, as specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ix) of this section.
              (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of normal operation (e.g., a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.

              (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this running average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (h)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;
              (B) The running average is based on at least six one-hour average values; and
              (C) The running average reflects a period of normal operation.
              (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of normal operation, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
              (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.
              (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (h)(1)(v)(C) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
              (A) Upon initial installation.
              (B) Annually after initial installation.
              (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.
              (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
              (A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
              (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
              (C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
              (D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current. The current description shall, at all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.

              (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average or batch cycle daily average value, for any operating day when the daily average or batch cycle daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance date was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
              (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average or batch cycle daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as specified in paragraph (e)(6)(x) of this section. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.
              (ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily average or batch cycle daily average values as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average or batch cycle daily average value for each operating day and shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average or batch cycle daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, for the duration specified in paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of normal operation.
              (iv) For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, an excursion means that the daily average or batch cycle daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2)(iv)(A) and (h)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.
              (A) [Reserved]
              (B) An excused excursion, as described in § 63.505(i), shall not be considered an excursion for the purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

              (i)(1) As of January 1, 2012, and within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test, as defined in § 63.2 and as required in this subpart, you must submit performance test data, except opacity data, electronically to EPA's Central Data Exchange by using the Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/ert tool.html/) or other compatible electronic spreadsheet. Only data collected using test methods compatible with ERT are subject to this requirement to be submitted electronically into EPA's WebFIRE database.
              (2) All reports required by this subpart not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) of this section must be sent to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13. If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, these reports may be submitted on electronic media. The Administrator retains the right to require submittal of reports subject to paragraph (i)(1) of this section in paper format.

              § 63.520
              Applicability and designation of sources.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to all existing, new, and reconstructed manufacturers of basic liquid epoxy resins (BLR) and manufacturers of wet strength resins (WSR) that are located at a plant site that is a major source, as defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act. Research and development facilities, as defined in § 63.522, are exempt from the provisions of this subpart. The affected source is also defined in § 63.522. If a change occurs to an existing source that does not constitute reconstruction then the additions have to meet the existing source requirements of the MACT standards. Any reconstruction of an existing source, or construction of a new source, must meet the new source standard. Affected sources are also subject to certain requirements of subpart A of this part, as specified in Table 1 of this subpart.

              (b) New and reconstructed sources subject to this subpart shall be in compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart upon startup.
            
            
              § 63.522
              Definitions.
              Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or any official designee of the Administrator.
              
                Affected source means all HAP emission points within a facility that are related to the production of BLR or WSR, including process vents, storage tanks, wastewater systems, and equipment leaks.
              
                Basic liquid epoxy resins (BLR) means resins made by reacting epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to form diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBPA).
              
                Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that may be associated with a single unit operation. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flow rate equal to the rate of the charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vessel vapor space. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process operations.
              
                Batch process refers to a discontinuous process involving the bulk movement of material through sequential manufacturing steps. Mass, temperature, concentration, and other properties of a system vary with time. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not typically occur simultaneously in a batch process.
              
                Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device or back into the process.
              
                Continuous process means a process where the inputs and outputs flow continuously throughout the duration of the process. Continuous processes are typically steady-state.
              
                Drain system means the system used to convey wastewater streams from a process unit, product storage tank, or feed storage tank to a waste management unit. The term includes all process drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations, down to the receiving waste management unit. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from all other drain systems, is excluded from this definition.
              
                Equipment leaks means emissions of hazardous air pollutants from a connector, pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, or instrumentation system in organic hazardous air pollutant service.
              
                Process vent means a point of emission from a unit operation. Typical process vents include condenser vents, vacuum pumps, steam ejectors, and atmospheric vents from reactors and other process vessels.
              
                Production-based emission rate means a ratio of the amount of HAP emitted to the amount of BLR or WSR produced.
              
                Research and development facility means laboratory operations whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products, where the operations are under the close supervision of technically trained personnel, and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale, except in a de minimis manner.
              
                Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store liquids that contain one or more HAP compounds.
              
                Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and recycle materials. There may be several emission episodes within a single unit operation.
              
                Waste management unit means any component, piece of equipment, structure, or transport mechanism used in storing, treating, or disposing of wastewater streams, or conveying wastewater between storage, treatment, or disposal operations.
              
                Wastewater means aqueous liquid waste streams exiting equipment at an affected source.
              
                Wastewater system means a system made up of a drain system and one or more waste management units.
              
                Wet strength resins (WSR) means polyamide/ epichlorohydrin condensates which are used to increase the tensile strength of paper products.

              (a) Owners or operators of existing affected BLR sources shall operate sources such that the rate of emissions of hazardous air pollutants from all process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems combined shall not exceed 130 pounds per 1 million pounds of BLR produced.
              (b) Owners or operators of new or reconstructed affected BLR sources shall reduce uncontrolled emissions from the sum of uncontrolled process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems by 98 percent, or limit the total emissions from these emission points to 5,000 pounds per year.
              (1) For process vents, uncontrolled emissions are defined as gaseous emission streams past the last recovery device.
              (2) For storage tanks, uncontrolled emissions are defined as emissions calculated according to the methodology specified in § 63.150(g)(3).
              (3) For wastewater systems, uncontrolled emissions are the total amount of HAP discharged to the drain system.

              (1) Limit the total emissions of hazardous air pollutants from all process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems to 7 pounds per 1 million pounds of wet strength resins produced; or
              (2) Comply with the requirements of subpart H of this part to control emissions from equipment leaks.
            
            
              § 63.525
              Compliance and performance testing.
              (a) The owner or operator of any existing affected BLR source shall, in order to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission limit, determine the emission rate from all process vent, storage tank, and wastewater system emission points using the methods described below. Compliance tests shall be performed under normal operating conditions.
              (1) The owner or operator shall use the EPA Test Methods from 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, listed in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, to determine emissions from process vents. Testing of process vents on equipment operating as part of a continuous process will consist of conducting three 1-hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. Organic HAP or TOC concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of each 1-hour test run, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. If the flow of gaseous emissions is intermittent, determination of emissions from process vents shall be performed according to the methods specified in paragraph (e) of this section. For process vents with continuous gas streams, the emission rate used to determine compliance shall be the average emission rate of the 3 test runs. For process vents with intermittent emission streams, the calculated emission rate or the emission rate from a single test run may be used to determine compliance.
              (i) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is a pitot tube. A traverse shall be conducted before and after each 1-hour sampling period. No traverse is necessary when using Method 2A or 2D to determine flow rate.
              (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for the determination of gas stream volumetric flow rate. If Method 2 or 2C is used, the velocity measurements shall be made at a single point, in conjunction with the traverse, to establish an average velocity across the stack.
              (iii) Method 25A and/or Methods 18 and 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the concentration of HAP in the streams.
              (iv) Initial determination of de minimis status for process vents may be made by engineering assessment, as specified in § 63.526(a)(1)(iv).
              (2) Emissions from wastewater treatment systems shall be determined in accordance with the methods described in 40 CFR part 63, appendix C.
              (3) Emissions from storage tanks shall be calculated in accordance with the methods specified in § 63.150(g)(3).
              (b) The owner or operator of any existing affected BLR source shall determine a production-based emission rate for each emission point by dividing the emission rate of each emission point by the BLR production rate of the source. The production rate shall be based on normal operations.
              (1) The production-based emission rate for process vents shall be calculated by dividing the average emission rate the average production rate.
              (2) The production-based emission rate for storage tanks shall be calculated by dividing annual emissions for each storage tank emission point by the production rate for a one-year period. The production rate shall be calculated using the same data used to calculate the production-based emission rate in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, converted to an annual rate.

              (3) The production-based emission rate for wastewater systems shall be calculated by dividing annual emissions for each wastewater system emission point by the production rate for one-year period. The production rate shall be calculated using the same data used to calculate the production-based emission rate in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, converted to an annual rate.

              (c) The owner or operator of an existing affected BLR source shall calculate the total emissions per product produced by summing the production-based emissions for all process vent, storage tank, and wastewater system emission points according to the following equation:
              
              E=Σ PV + Σ ST + Σ WW
              
              
                where:
                
                E = emissions, pounds (lb) HAP per million (MM) lb product;
                PV = process vent emissions, lb HAP/MM lb product;
                ST = storage tank emissions, lb HAP/MM lb product; and
                WW = wastewater system emissions, lb HAP/MM lb product.
              
              
              The source is in compliance with the standard for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems if the sum of the equation is less than the applicable emission limit from § 63.523(a).
              (d) The owner or operator of any new or reconstructed affected BLR source shall demonstrate compliance using the methods described in this section.
              (1) Any owner or operator who elects to comply with § 63.523(b) by achieving 98 percent control of emissions from process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems shall demonstrate compliance according to the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator shall perform testing as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine controlled and uncontrolled emissions from process vents.

              (ii) The owner or operator shall calculate controlled and uncontrolled emissions from storage tanks in accordance with the methods specified in § 63.150(g)(3).
              (iii) The owner or operator shall determine controlled and uncontrolled emissions from wastewater systems using the methodology of 40 CFR part 63, appendix C. Uncontrolled emission calculations shall be consistent with the definition of uncontrolled wastewater system emissions in § 63.523(b)(3).
              (iv) The owner or operator shall calculate the percent reduction in emissions from process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems combined. The affected source is in compliance if the emission reduction is greater than or equal to 98 percent.
              (2) Any owner or operator who elects to comply with § 63.523(b) by limiting HAP emissions from process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems to 5,000 pounds per year or less shall demonstrate compliance according to the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Emissions from process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems shall be determined according to paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section. Emissions shall be converted to annual emissions. Annual emission calculations shall reflect production levels representative of normal operating conditions.

              (1) Emissions of HAP reactor process vents shall be calculated for each batch emission episode according to the methodologies described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
              (i) Emissions from vapor displacement due to transfer of material into or out of the reactor shall be calculated according to the following equation:
              
                ER08MR95.002
              
              
                where:
                
                E = mass emission rate;
                yi = saturated mole fraction of HAP in the vapor phase;

                V = volume of gas displaced from the vessel;
                
                R = ideal gas law constant;

              (ii) Emissions from reactor purging shall be calculated using the methodology described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, except that for purge flow rates greater than 100 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm), the mole fraction of HAP will be assumed to be 25 percent of the saturated value.
              (iii) Emissions caused by heating of the reactor vessel shall be calculated according to the following methodology:
              
                ER08MR95.003
              
              
                where:
                
                E = mass of HAP vapor displaced from the vessel being heated up;
                (Pi)Tn = partial pressure of each HAP in the vessel headspace at initial (n = 1) and final (n = 2) temperature;
                Pa1 = initial gas pressure in the vessel;
                Pa2 = final gas pressure; and
                MWHAP = the average molecular weight of HAP present in the vessel.
              
              
              The moles of gas displaced is represented by:
              
                ER08MR95.004
              
              
                where:
                
                Δη = number of lb-moles of gas displaced;
                V = volume of free space in the vessel;
                R = ideal gas law constant;
                Pa1 = initial gas pressure in the vessel;
                Pa2 = final gas pressure;

              The initial pressure of the noncondensable gas in the vessel shall be calculated according to the following equation:
              
                ER08MR95.005

                where n is the number of different HAP compounds in the emission stream.
              
              

              (2) Emissions of HAP from process vents may be measured directly. The EPA Test Methods listed in paragraph (e)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, from 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 63.524 by direct measurement. Testing shall be performed for every batch emission episode of the unit operation. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured at 15-minute intervals, or at least once during each batch emission episode. Organic HAP or TOC concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of each episode, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. Test conditions shall represent the normal operating conditions under which the data used to calculate the production rate are taken.
              
              (i) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is a pitot tube. A traverse shall be conducted before and after each sampling period. No traverse is necessary when using Method 2A or 2D.
              (ii) Method 2,2A, 2C or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for the determination of gas stream volumetric flow rate.

              (iv) The owner or operator may choose to perform tests only during those periods of the episode in which the emission rate for the entire episode can be determined, or when the emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the episode. The owner or operator who chooses either of these options must develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances, and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used provided the results are still relevant to the current process vent stream conditions.
              (v) For batch emission episodes of duration greater than 8 hours, the owner or operator is required to perform a maximum of 8 hours of testing. The test period must include the period of time in which the emission rate is predicted by the emission profile to be greater than average emission rate for the batch emission episode.
              (f) The owner or operator of any affected WSR source that chooses to comply with the emissions limit for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems shall calculate emissions from storage tanks in accordance with the methods specified in § 63.150(g)(3).

              (1) The owner or operator shall calculate an average emission rate per batch as the average of the results from the performance tests or calculations. The production-based emission rate shall be calculated by dividing the emissions per batch by the average production per batch.
              (2) Compliance shall be determined according to the methodology described in paragraph (c) of this section. The source is in compliance with the standard for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems if the sum of the equation in paragraph (c) of this section is less than the applicable emission limit from § 63.524.
              (i) The owner or operator of any affected BLR source or any affected WSR source that chooses to comply with the requirements of subpart H of this part must demonstrate the ability of its specific program to meet the compliance requirements therein to achieve initial compliance.

              Monitoring requirements.

              (a) The owner or operator of any existing, new, or reconstructed affected BLR source shall provide evidence of continued compliance with the standard. During the initial compliance demonstration, maximum or minimum operating parameters, as appropriate, shall be established for processes and control devices that will indicate the source is in compliance. If the operating parameter to be established is a maximum, the value of the parameter shall be the average of the maximum values from each of the three test runs. If the operating parameter to be established is a minimum, the value of the parameter shall be the average of the minimum values from each of the three test runs. Parameter values for process vents with intermittent emission streams shall be determined as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The owner or operator shall operate processes and control devices within these parameters to ensure continued compliance with the standard. A de minimis level is specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Monitoring parameters are specified for various process vent control scenarios in paragraphs (a) (2) through (6) of this section.
              (1) For affected BLR sources, uncontrolled emission points emitting less than one pound per year of HAP are not subject to the monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) (2) through (6) of this section. The owner or operator shall use the methods specified in § 63.525(a), as applicable, or as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, to demonstrate which emission points satisfy the de minimis criteria, to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
              (i) For the purpose of determining de minimis status for emission points, engineering assessment may be used to determine process vent stream flow rate and/or concentration for the representative operating conditions expected to yield the highest flow rate and concentration. Engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the following:
              (A) Previous test results provided the tests are representative of current operating practices at the process unit.
              (B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the process under representative operating conditions.
              (C) Maximum flow rate, HAP emission rate, concentration, or other relevant parameter specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent.
              (D) Design analysis based on accepted chemical engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Use of material balances based on process stoichiometry to estimate maximum organic HAP concentrations,
              (2) Estimation of maximum flow rate based on physical equipment design such as pump or blower capacities,
              (3) Estimation of HAP concentrations based on saturation conditions.
              (ii) All data, assumptions, and procedures used in the engineering assessment shall be documented in accordance with § 63.527(c).
              (2) For affected sources using water scrubbers, the owner or operator shall establish a minimum scrubber water flow rate as a site-specific operating parameter which must be measured and recorded every 15 minutes. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance if the scrubber water flow rate, averaged over any continuous 24-hour period, is below the minimum value established during the initial compliance demonstration.
              (3) For affected sources using condensers, the owner or operator shall establish the maximum condenser outlet gas temperature as a site-specific operating parameter which must be measured and recorded every 15 minutes. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance if the condenser outlet gas temperature, averaged over any continuous 24-hour period, is greater than the maximum value established during the initial compliance demonstration.
              (4) For affected sources using carbon adsorbers or having uncontrolled process vents, the owner or operator shall establish a maximum outlet HAP concentration as the site-specific operating parameter which must be measured and recorded every 15 minutes. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance if the outlet HAP concentration, averaged over any continuous 24-hour period, is greater than the maximum value established during the initial compliance demonstration.

              (5) For affected sources using flares, the presence of the pilot flame shall be monitored every 15 minutes. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance upon loss of pilot flame.
              (6) Wastewater system parameters to be monitored are the parameters specified under 40 CFR part 414, subpart E. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance with this subpart W if it is found to be out of compliance with 40 CFR part 414, subpart E.
              (b) The owner or operator of any existing, new, or reconstructed affected WSR source that chooses to comply with the emission limit for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems shall provide evidence of continued compliance with the standard. As part of the initial compliance demonstrations for batch process vents, test data or compliance calculations shall be used to establish a maximum or minimum level of a relevant operating parameter for each unit operation. The parameter value for each unit operation shall represent the worst case value of the operating parameter from all episodes in the unit operation. The owner or operator shall operate processes and control devices within these parameters to ensure continued compliance with the standard.
              (1) For batch process vents, the level shall be established in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section if compliance testing is performed.
              (i) If testing is used to demonstrate initial compliance, the appropriate parameter shall be monitored during all batch emission episodes in the unit operation.
              (ii) An average monitored parameter value shall be determined for each of the batch emission episodes in the unit operation.
              (iii) If the level to be established for the unit operation is a maximum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average parameter values determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (iv) If the level to be established for the unit operation is a minimum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average parameter values determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (2) Affected sources with condensers on process vents shall establish the maximum condenser outlet gas temperature as a site-specific operating parameter, which must be measured every 15 minutes, or at least once for batch emission episodes less than 15 minutes in duration. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance if the maximum condenser outlet gas temperature, averaged over the duration of the batch emission episode or unit operation, is greater than the value established during the initial compliance demonstration.
              (3) For affected sources using water scrubbers, the owner or operator shall establish a minimum scrubber water flow rate as a site-specific operating parameter which must be measured and recorded every 15 minutes, or at least once for batch emission episodes less than 15 minutes in duration. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance if the scrubber water flow rate, averaged over the duration of the batch emission episode or unit operation, is below the minimum flow rate established during the initial compliance demonstration.
              (4) For affected sources using carbon adsorbers or having uncontrolled process vents, the owner or operator shall establish a maximum outlet HAP concentration as the site-specific operating parameter which must be measured and recorded every 15 minutes, or at least once for batch emission episodes of duration shorter than 15 minutes. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance if the outlet HAP concentration, averaged over the duration of the batch emission episode or unit operation, is greater than the value established during the initial compliance demonstration.
              (5) For affected sources using flares, the presence of the pilot flame shall be monitored every 15 minutes, or at least once for batch emission episodes less than 15 minutes in duration. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance upon loss of pilot flame.

              (6) Wastewater system parameters to be monitored are the parameters specified by 40 CFR part 414, subpart E. The affected source will be considered to be out of compliance with this subpart W if it is found to be out of compliance with 40 CFR part 414, subpart E.
              (c) Periods of time when monitoring measurements exceed the parameter values do not constitute a violation if they occur during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction, and the facility is operated in accordance with § 63.6(e)(1).
              (d) The owner or operator of any affected WSR source that chooses to comply with the requirements of subpart H of this part shall meet the monitoring requirements of subpart H of this part.

              (c) The owner or operator of any affected BLR source, as well the owner or operator of any affected WSR source that chooses to comply with the emission limit for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems, who demonstrates that certain process vents are below the de minimis cutoff for continuous monitoring specified in § 63.526(a)(1)(i), shall maintain up-to-date, readily accessible records of the following information to document that a HAP emission rate of less than one pound per year is maintained:
              (1) The information used to determine de minimis status for each de minimis process vent, as specified in § 63.526(a)(1)(i);
              (2) Any process changes as defined in § 63.115(e) of subpart G of this part that increase the HAP emission rate;
              (3) Any recalculation or measurement of the HAP emission rate pursuant to § 63.115(e) of subpart G of this part; and
              (4) Whether or not the HAP emission rate increases to one pound per year or greater as a result of the process change.
              (d) The owner or operator of any affected BLR source, as well as the owner or operator of any affected WSR source who elects to implement the leak detection and repair program specified in subpart H of this part, shall implement the recordkeeping requirements outlined therein. All records shall be retained for a period of 5 years, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 63.10(b)(1).
              (e) Any excursion from the required monitoring parameter, unless otherwise excused, shall be considered a violation of the emission standard.
            
            
              
              § 63.528
              Reporting requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of any affected BLR source, as well as the owner or operator of any affected WSR source that elects to comply with the emission limit for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems, shall comply with the reporting requirements of applicable paragraphs of § 63.10 of subpart A of this part, as specified in the General Provisions applicability table in this subpart. The owner or operator shall also submit to the Administrator, as part of the quarterly excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report and summary report required by § 63.10(e)(3) of subpart A of this part, the following recorded information.
              (1) Reports of monitoring data, including 15-minute monitoring values as well as daily average values or per-unit operation average values, as applicable, of monitored parameters for all operating days or unit operations when the average values were outside the ranges established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit.
              (2) Reports of the duration of periods when monitoring data is not collected for each excursion caused by insufficient monitoring data. An excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device.
              (i) When the period of control device operation is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
              (ii) When the period of control device operation is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than one of the hours during the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data.
              (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.
              (3) Whenever a process change, as defined in § 63.115(e) of subpart G of this part, is made that causes the emission rate from a de minimis emission point to become a process vent with an emission rate of one pound per year or greater, the owner or operator shall submit a report within 180 calendar days after the process change. The report may be submitted as part of the next summary report required under § 63.10(e)(3) of subpart A of this part. The report shall include:
              (i) A description of the process change; and
              (ii) The results of the recalculation of the emission rate.
              (b) The owner or operator of any affected BLR source, as well as the owner or operator of any affected WSR source who elects to implement the leak detection and repair program specified in subpart H of this part, shall implement the reporting requirements outlined therein. Copies of all reports shall be retained as records for a period of 5 years, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 63.10(b)(1).
              (c) The owner or operator of any affected BLR source, as well as the owner or operator of any affected WSR source that elects to comply with the emission limit for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems shall include records of wastewater system monitoring parameters in the Notification of Compliance Status and summary reports required by subpart A of this part.
            
            
              § 63.529
              Implementation and enforcement.

              (a) This subpart can be implemented and enforced by the U.S. EPA, or a delegated authority such as the applicable State, local, or Tribal agency. If the U.S. EPA Administrator has delegated authority to a State, local, or Tribal agency, then that agency, in addition to the U.S. EPA, has the authority to implement and enforce this subpart. Contact the applicable U.S. EPA Regional Office to find out if implementation and enforcement of this subpart is delegated to a State, local, or Tribal agency.
              
              (b) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority of this subpart to a State, local, or Tribal agency under subpart E of this part, the authorities contained in paragraph (c) of this section are retained by the Administrator of U.S. EPA and cannot be transferred to the State, local, or Tribal agency.
              (c) The authorities that cannot be delegated to State, local, or Tribal agencies are as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) Approval of alternatives to the requirements in §§ 63.520, 63.521, 63.523, and 63.524. Where these standards reference another rule, the cited provisions in that rule will be delegated according to the delegation provisions of that rule.
              (2) Approval of major alternatives to test methods for under § 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
              (3) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring under § 63.8(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
              (4) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting under § 63.10(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.

              Definitions.
              Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:
              
                Affected source means any of the following sources at a secondary lead smelter: Blast, reverberatory, rotary, and electric furnaces; refining kettles; agglomerating furnaces; dryers; process fugitive emissions sources; buildings containing lead bearing materials; and fugitive dust sources.
              
                Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
              
                Agglomerating furnace means a furnace used to melt into a solid mass flue dust that is collected from a baghouse.
              
                Bag leak detection system means an instrument that is capable of monitoring particulate matter (dust) loadings in the exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag failures. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, transmittance or other effect to monitor relative particulate matter loadings.
              
                Battery breaking area means the plant location at which lead-acid batteries are broken, crushed, or disassembled and separated into components.
              
                Blast furnace means a smelting furnace consisting of a vertical cylinder atop a crucible, into which lead-bearing charge materials are introduced at the top of the furnace and combustion air is introduced through tuyeres at the bottom of the cylinder, and that uses coke as a fuel source and that is operated at such a temperature in the combustion zone (greater than 980 Celsius) that lead compounds are chemically reduced to elemental lead metal.
              
                Blast furnace charging location means the physical opening through which raw materials are introduced into a blast furnace.
              
                Collocated blast furnace and reverberatory furnace means operation at the same location of a blast furnace and a reverberatory furnace where the vent streams of the furnaces are mixed before cooling, with the volumetric flow rate discharged from the blast furnace being equal to or less than that discharged from the reverberatory furnace.
              
                Dryer means a chamber that is heated and that is used to remove moisture from lead-bearing materials before they are charged to a smelting furnace.
              
                Dryer transition equipment means the junction between a dryer and the charge hopper or conveyor, or the junction between the dryer and the smelting furnace feed chute or hopper located at the ends of the dryer.
              
                Electric furnace means a smelting furnace consisting of a vessel into which reverberatory furnace slag is introduced and that uses electrical energy to heat the reverberatory furnace slag to such a temperature (greater than 980 Celsius) that lead compounds are reduced to elemental lead metal.
              
                Fugitive dust source means a stationary source of hazardous air pollutant emissions at a secondary lead smelter that is not associated with a specific process or process fugitive vent or stack. Fugitive dust sources include, but are not limited to, roadways, storage piles, lead bearing material handling transfer points, lead bearing material transport areas, lead bearing material storage areas, other lead bearing material process areas, and buildings.
              
                Furnace and refining/casting area means any area of a secondary lead smelter in which:
              (1) Smelting furnaces are located;
              (2) Refining operations occur; or
              (3) Casting operations occur.
              
                Lead alloy means an alloy in which the predominant component is lead.
              
                Lead bearing material means material with a lead content equal to or greater than 5 mg/l as measured by EPA Method 1311 (Under Method 1311, only materials with at least 100 ppm lead will be considered to be lead bearing).
              
                Leeward wall means the furthest exterior wall of a total enclosure that is opposite the windward wall.
              
                Maintenance activity means any of the following routine maintenance and repair activities that could generate fugitive lead dust:
              (1) Replacement or repair of refractory, or any internal or external part of equipment used to process, handle or control lead-containing materials.
              (2) Replacement of any duct section used to convey lead-containing exhaust.

              § 63.543
              What are my standards for process vents?
              (a) For existing sources, you must maintain the concentration of lead compounds in any process vent gas at or below 1.0 milligrams of lead per dry standard cubic meter (0.00043 grains of lead per dry standard cubic foot). You must maintain the flow-weighted average concentration of lead compounds in vent gases from a secondary lead smelting facility at or below 0.20 milligrams of lead per dry standard cubic meter (0.000087 grains of lead per dry standard cubic foot).
              (1) You must demonstrate compliance with the flow weighted average emissions limit on a 12-month rolling average basis, calculated monthly using the most recent test data available.
              (2) Until 12 monthly weighted average emissions rates have been accumulated, calculate only the monthly average weighted emissions rate.
              (3) You must use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the flow-weighted average concentration of lead compounds from process vents:
              
                ER05JA12.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                CFWA = Flow-weighted average concentration of all process vents.
                n = Number of process vents.
                Fi = Flow rate from process vent i in dry standard cubic feet per minute, as measured during the most recent compliance test.
                Ci = Concentration of lead in process vent i, as measured during the most recent compliance test.
              
              
              (4) Each month, you must use the concentration of lead and flow rate obtained during the most recent compliance test performed prior to or during that month to perform the calculation using Equation 1 of this section.
              (5) If a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) is used to measure the concentration of lead in a vent, the monthly average lead concentration and monthly average flow rate must be used rather than the most recent compliance test data.
              (b) For new sources that begin construction or reconstruction after May 19, 2011 you must maintain the concentration of lead compounds in any process vent gas at or below 0.20 milligrams of lead per dry standard cubic meter (0.000087 grains of lead per dry standard cubic foot).
              (c) You must meet the applicable emissions limits for total hydrocarbons and dioxins and furans from furnace sources specified in Table 2 of this subpart. There are no standards for dioxins and furans during periods of startup and shutdown.

              (d) If you combine furnace emissions from multiple types of furnaces and these furnaces do not meet the definition of collocated blast and reverberatory furnaces, you must calculate your emissions limit for the combined furnace stream using Equation 2 of this section.
              
                ER05JA12.001
              
              
                Where:
                CEL = Flow-weighted average emissions limit (concentration) of combined furnace vents.
                n = Number of furnace vents.
                Fi = Flow rate from furnace vent i in dry standard cubic feet per minute.
                CEli = Emissions limit (concentration) of pollutant in furnace vent i as specified in Table 2 of this subpart.
              
              
              (e) If you combine furnace emissions with the furnace charging process fugitive emissions and discharge them to the atmosphere through a common emissions point, you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable total hydrocarbons concentration limit specified in paragraph (c) of this section at a location downstream from the point at which the two emissions streams are combined.
              (f) If you do not combine the furnace charging process fugitive emissions with the furnace process emissions, and discharge such emissions to the atmosphere through separate emissions points, you must maintain the total hydrocarbons concentration in the exhaust gas at or below 20 parts per million by volume, expressed as propane.
              (g) Following the initial performance or compliance test to demonstrate compliance with the lead emissions limits specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must conduct performance tests according to the schedule in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.
              (1) Conduct an annual performance test for lead compounds from each process vent (no later than 12 calendar months following the previous compliance test), unless you install and operate a CEMS meeting the requirements of § 63.8.
              (2) If an annual compliance test demonstrates that a process vent emitted lead compounds at 0.10 milligram of lead per dry standard cubic meter or less during the time of the annual compliance test, you may submit a written request to the Administrator applying for an extension of up to 24 calendar months from the previous compliance test to conduct the next compliance test for lead compounds.
              (h) Following the initial performance or compliance test to demonstrate compliance with the total hydrocarbons emissions limits in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section, you must conduct an annual performance test for total hydrocarbons emissions from each process vent that has established limits for total hydrocarbons (no later than 12 calendar months following the previous compliance test), unless you install and operate a CEMS meeting the requirements of § 63.8. If an annual compliance test demonstrates that a process vent emitted total hydrocarbons at less than 50 percent of the allowable limit during the time of the annual compliance test, you may submit a written request to the Administrator applying for an extension of up to 24 calendar months from the previous compliance test to conduct the next compliance test for total hydrocarbons.

              (i) Following the initial performance or compliance test to demonstrate compliance with the dioxins and furans emissions limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section, you must conduct a performance test for dioxins and furans emissions from each process vent that has established limits for dioxins and furans at least once every 6 years following the previous compliance test.
              (j) You must conduct the performance tests specified in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section under maximum representative operating conditions for the process. During the performance test, you may operate the control device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
              (k) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (l) If you own or operate a unit subject to emission limits in Table 2 of this subpart, you must minimize the unit's startup and shutdown periods following the manufacturer's recommended procedures, if available. You must develop and follow standard operating procedures designed to minimize emissions of total hydrocarbon for each startup or shutdown scenario anticipated. You must submit a signed statement in the Notification of Compliance Status report that indicates that you conducted startups and shutdowns according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures, if available, and the standard operating procedures designed to minimize emissions of total hydrocarbons.
              (m) In addition to complying with the applicable emissions limits for dioxins and furans listed in Table 2 to this subpart, you must operate a process to separate plastic battery casing materials from all automotive batteries prior to introducing feed into a furnace.

              Implementation and enforcement.
              (a) This subpart can be implemented and enforced by the U.S. EPA, or a delegated authority such as the applicable State, local, or tribal agency. If the U.S. EPA Administrator has delegated authority to a State, local, or tribal agency, then that agency, in addition to the U.S. EPA, has the authority to implement and enforce this subpart. Contact the applicable U.S. EPA Regional Office to find out if this subpart is delegated to a State, local, or tribal agency.
              (b) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority of this subpart to a State, local, or tribal agency under subpart E of this part, the authorities contained in paragraph (c) of this section are retained by the Administrator of U.S. EPA and cannot be transferred to the State, local, or tribal agency.
              (c) The authorities that cannot be delegated to State, local, or tribal agencies are as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) Approval of alternatives to the requirements in §§ 63.541, 63.543 through 63.544, § 63.545, and § 63.546.
              (2) Approval of major alternatives to test methods under § 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
              (3) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring under § 63.8(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
              (4) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting under § 63.10(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
            
            
              § 63.552
              Affirmative defense to civil penalties for exceedance of emissions limit during malfunction.
              In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (a) Affirmative defense. To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (1) The excess emissions:
              (i) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner.
              (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices.
              (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for.
              (iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance.
              (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emissions limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs.
              (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions.
              (4) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.
              (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health.
              (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices.

              (7) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs.
              
              (8) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions.
              (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (b) Notification. The owner or operator of the affected source experiencing an exceedance of its emissions limit(s) during a malfunction, shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile transmission as soon as possible, but no later than two business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense, shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45-day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

              (b) Reasonably available control technology (RACT) standards. (1) The provisions of this subpart pertaining to RACT standards in § 63.562(c) and (d) of this subpart are applicable to sources with throughput of 10 M barrels or 200 M barrels, as that term is defined in § 63.561, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) Sources with throughput less than 10 M barrels and 200 M barrels, as that term is defined in § 63.561, are not subject to the emissions standards in § 63.562(c) and (d).
              (c) General Provisions applicability. Owners or operators of affected sources, as that term is defined in § 63.561, of this subpart must comply with the requirements of subpart A of this part in accordance with the provisions for applicability of subpart A to this subpart in Table 1 of this section.
              (d) Exemptions from MACT and RACT standards. (1) This subpart does not apply to emissions resulting from marine tank vessel loading operations, as that term is defined in § 63.561, of commodities with vapor pressures less than 10.3 kilopascals (kPa) (1.5 pounds per square inch, absolute) (psia) at standard conditions, 20 °C and 760 millimeters Hg (mm Hg).
              (2) The provisions of this subpart pertaining to the MACT standards in § 63.562(b)(2), (3) and (4) and to the RACT standards in § 63.562(c)(3) and (4) do not apply to marine tank vessel loading operations where emissions are reduced by using a vapor balancing system, as that term is defined in § 63.561. The provisions pertaining to the vapor collection system, ship-to-shore compatibility, and vapor tightness of marine tank vessels in § 63.562(b)(1) and (c)(2) do apply.
              (3) The provisions of this subpart pertaining to the MACT standards in § 63.562(b)(2), (3), and (4) do not apply to marine tank vessel loading operations that are contiguous with refinery operations at sources subject to and complying with subpart CC of this part, National Emissions Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from Petroleum Refineries, except to the extent that any such provisions of this subpart are made applicable by subpart CC of this part.

              (4) The provisions of this subpart pertaining to the MACT standards in § 63.562(b) and (d) do not apply to benzene emissions from marine tank vessel loading operations that are subject to and complying with 40 CFR part 61, subpart BB, National Emissions Standards for Benzene Emissions from Benzene Transfer Operations, except that benzene emissions or other HAP emissions (i.e., nonbenzene HAP emissions) from marine tank vessel loading operations that are not subject to subpart BB are subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (5) The provisions of this subpart pertaining to the MACT standards in § 63.562(b) and (d) do not apply to marine tank vessel loading operations at loading berths that only transfer liquids containing organic HAP as impurities, as that term is defined in § 63.561.
              (6) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to marine tank vessel loading operations at existing offshore loading terminals, as that term is defined in § 63.561, however existing offshore loading terminals must meet the submerged fill standards of 46 CFR 153.282.
              (7) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to ballasting operations, as that term is defined in § 63.561.
              (e) Compliance dates—(1) MACT standards compliance dates, except the Valdez Marine Terminal (VMT) source.

                Affected source means a source with emissions of 10 or 25 tons, a new source with emissions less than 10 and 25 tons, a new major source offshore loading terminal, a source with throughput of 10 M barrels or 200 M barrels, or the VMT source, that is subject to the emissions standards in § 63.562.
              
                Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or a defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
              
                Air pollution control device or control device means a combustion device or vapor recovery device.
              
                Ballasting operations means the introduction of ballast water into a cargo tank of a tankship or oceangoing barge.
              
                Baseline operating parameter means a minimum or maximum value of a process parameter, established for a control device during a performance test where the control device is meeting the required emissions reduction or established as the manufacturer recommended operating parameter, that, if achieved by itself or in combination with one or more other operating parameters, determines if a control device is operating properly.
              
                Boiler means a device that combusts any fuel and produces steam or heats water or any other heat transfer medium. This term includes any duct burner that combusts fuel and is part of a combined cycle system.
              
                Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device used to change the position of a valve (e.g., from open to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal.
              
                Combustion device means all equipment, including, but not limited to, thermal incinerators, catalytic incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters used for combustion or destruction of organic vapors.
              
                Commenced means, with respect to construction of an air pollution control device, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction.
              
                Commodity means a distinct product that a source loads onto marine tank vessels.

                Crude oil means a naturally occurring mixture consisting predominantly of hydrocarbons and/or sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen derivatives of hydrocarbons that is removed from the earth in a liquid state or is capable of being so removed.
              
                Exceedance or Variance means, with respect to parametric monitoring, the operating parameter of the air pollution control device that is monitored as an indication of proper operation of the control device is outside the acceptable range or limits for the baseline parameter given in § 63.563(b)(4) through (9).
              
                Excess emissions means, with respect to emissions monitoring, the concentration of the outlet stream of the air pollution control device is outside the acceptable range or limits for the baseline concentration given in § 63.563(b)(4) through (9).
              
                Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas flow is present in a line or vent system.

Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
              (1) The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards by evaluating an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements.
              (2) The owner or operator of an affected source shall develop a written operation and maintenance plan that describes in detail a program of corrective action for varying (i.e., exceeding baseline parameters) air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, based on monitoring requirements in § 63.564, used to comply with these emissions standards. The plan shall also identify all routine or otherwise predictable continuous monitoring system (thermocouples, pressure transducers, continuous emissions monitors (CEMS), etc.) variances.
              (i) The plan shall specify procedures (preventive maintenance) to be followed to ensure that pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment functions properly and variances of the control equipment and monitoring equipment are minimal.

              (ii) The plan shall identify all operating parameters to be monitored and recorded for the air pollution control device as indicators of proper operation and shall establish the frequency at which the parameters will be monitored (see § 63.564).
              (iii) Owners or operators of affected sources shall incorporate a standardized inspection schedule for each component of the control device used to comply with the emissions standards in § 63.562(b), (c), and (d). To satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, the owner or operator may use the inspection schedule recommended by the vendor of the control system or any other technical publication regarding the operation of the control system.
              (iv) Owners or operators shall develop and implement a continuous monitoring system (CMS) quality control program. The owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request a site-specific performance evaluation test plan for the CMS performance evaluation required in § 63.8(e) of subpart A of this part. Each quality control program shall include, at a minimum, a written protocol that describes procedures for initial and any subsequent calibration of the CMS; determination and adjustment of the calibration drift of the CMS; preventive maintenance of the CMS, including spare parts inventory; data recording, calculations, and reporting; and accuracy audit procedures, including sampling and analysis methods. The owner or operation shall maintain records of the procedures that are part of the quality control program developed and implemented for CMS.
              (3) Based on the results of the determination made under paragraph (e)(2), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the operation and maintenance plan for that source. Revisions may be required if the plan:
              (i) Does not address a variance of the air pollution control equipment or monitoring equipment that has occurred that increases emissions;
              (ii) Fails to provide for operation during a variance of the air pollution control equipment or the monitoring equipment in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; or
              (iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting a variance of the air pollution control equipment or monitoring equipment as soon as reasonable.
              (4) If the operation and maintenance plan fails to address or inadequately addresses a variance event at the time the plan was initially developed, the owner or operator shall revise the operation and maintenance plan within 45 working days after such an event occurs. The revised plan shall include procedures for operating and maintaining the air pollution control equipment or monitoring equipment during similar variance events and a program for corrective action for such events.
              (5) The operation and maintenance plan shall be developed by the source's compliance date. The owner or operator shall keep the written operation and maintenance plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator for the life of the source. In addition, if the operation and maintenance plan is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the plan on record to be made available for inspection upon request by the Administrator for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan.
              (6) To satisfy the requirements of the operation and maintenance plan, the owner or operator may use the source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) plan, or other existing plans provided the alternative plans meet the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.
              (7) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the respondent fails to meet its burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.

              (i) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (A) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;
              (B) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;
              (C) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;
              (D) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
              (E) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;
              (F) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;
              (G) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;
              (H) At all times, the affected facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (I) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (ii) Notification. The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

              § 63.563
              Compliance and performance testing.
              (a) The following procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the emissions limits under § 63.562(b)(1), (c)(2), and (d)(1):
              (1) Vent stream by-pass requirements for the terminal's vapor collection system. (i) In accordance with § 63.562(b)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), and (d)(1)(i), each valve in the terminal's vapor collection system that would route displaced vapors to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, shall be secured closed during marine tank vessel loading operations either by using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration, or the by-pass line from the valve shall be equipped with a flow indicator, except for those valves used for pressure/vacuum relief, analyzers, instrumentation devices, sampling, and venting for maintenance. Marine tank vessel loading operations shall not be performed with open by-pass lines.
              (ii) Repairs shall be made to valves, car-seals, or closure mechanisms no later than 15 days after a change in the position of the valve or a break in the car-seal or closure mechanism is detected or no later than prior to the next marine tank vessel loading operation, whichever is later.
              (2) Ship-to-shore compatibility of vapor collection systems. Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, marine tank vessel loading operations must be performed only if the marine tank vessel's vapor collection equipment is compatible to the terminal's vapor collection system; marine tank vessel loading operations must be performed only when the marine tank vessel's vapor collection equipment is connected to the terminal's vapor collection system, as required in § 63.562(b)(1)(ii), (c)(2)(ii), and (d)(1)(ii).
              (3) Pressure/vacuum settings for the marine tank vessel's vapor collection equipment. During the initial performance test required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source shall demonstrate compliance with operating pressure requirements of 33 CFR 154.814 using the procedures in § 63.565(b).
              (4) Vapor-tightness requirements of the marine vessel. The owner or operator of an affected source shall use the procedures in paragraph (a)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section to ensure that marine tank vessels are vapor tight, as required in § 63.562(b)(1)(iii), (c)(2)(iii), and (d)(1)(iii).
              (i) Pressure test documentation for determining vapor tightness of the marine vessel. The owner or operator of a marine tank vessel, who loads commodities containing HAP not determined to be exempt under § 63.560(d) at an affected source, shall provide a copy of the vapor-tightness pressure test documentation described in § 63.567(i) for each marine tank vessel prior to loading. The date of the test listed in the documentation must be within the preceding 12 months, and the test must be conducted in accordance with the procedures in § 63.565(c)(1). Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the affected source must check vapor-tightness pressure test documentation for marine tank vessels loaded at positive pressure.
              (ii) Leak test documentation for determining vapor tightness of the marine vessel. If no documentation of the vapor tightness pressure test as described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section is available, the owner or operator of a marine tank vessel, who loads commodities containing HAP not determined to be exempt under § 63.560(d) at an affected source, shall provide the leak test documentation described in § 63.567(i) for each marine tank vessel prior to loading. The date of the test listed in the documentation must be within the preceding 12 months, and the test must be conducted in accordance with the procedures in § 63.565(c)(2). If the marine tank vessel has failed its most recent vapor-tightness leak test at that terminal, the owner or operator of the non-vapor-tight marine tank vessel shall provide documentation that the leaks detected during the previous vapor-tightness test have been repaired and documented with a successful vapor-tightness leak test described in § 63.565(c)(2) conducted during loading. If the owner or operator of the marine tank vessel can document that repair is technically infeasible without cleaning and gas freeing or dry-docking the vessel, the owner or operator of the affected source may load the marine tank vessel. Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, an affected source must check the vapor-tightness leak test documentation for marine tank vessels loaded at positive pressure.
              (iii) Leak test performed during loading using Method 21 for determining vapor tightness of the marine vessel. If no documentation of vapor tightness as described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section is available, the owner or operator of a marine tank vessel, who loads commodities containing HAP not determined to be exempt under § 63.560(d) at an affected source, shall perform a leak test of the marine tank vessel during marine tank vessel loading operation using the procedures described in § 63.565(c)(2).
              
              (A) If no leak is detected, the owner or operator of a marine tank vessel shall complete the documentation described in § 63.567(i) prior to departure of the vessel.
              (B) If a leak is detected, the owner or operator of the marine tank vessel shall document the vapor-tightness failure for the marine tank vessel prior to departure of the vessel. The leaking component shall be repaired prior to the next marine tank vessel loading operation at a controlled terminal unless the repair is technically infeasible without cleaning and gas freeing or dry-docking the vessel. If the owner or operator of the vessel provides documentation that repair of such equipment is technically infeasible without cleaning and gas freeing or dry-docking the vessel, the equipment responsible for the leak will be excluded from future Method 21 tests until repairs are effected. A copy of this documentation shall be maintained by the owner or operator of the affected source. Repair of the equipment responsible for the leak shall occur the next time the vessel is cleaned and gas freed or dry-docked. For repairs that are technically feasible without dry-docking the vessel, the owner or operator of the affected source shall not load the vessel again unless the marine tank vessel owner or operator can document that the equipment responsible for the leak has been repaired.
              (iv) Negative pressure loading. The owner or operator of an affected source shall ensure that a marine tank vessel is loaded with the product tank below atmospheric pressure (i.e., at negative gauge pressure). The pressure shall be measured between the facility's vapor connection and its manual isolation valve, and the measured pressure must be below atmospheric pressure. Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, marine tank vessel loading operations for nonvapor-tight vessels must be performed below atmospheric pressure (i.e., at negative gauge pressure) in the product tank.
              (b) Compliance determination for affected sources. The following procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the emissions limits under § 63.562(b), (c), and (d).
              (1) Initial performance test. An initial performance test shall be conducted using the procedures listed in § 63.7 of subpart A of this part according to the applicability in Table 1 of § 63.560, the procedures listed in this section, and the test methods listed in § 63.565. The initial performance test shall be conducted within 180 days after the compliance date for the specific affected source. During this performance test, sources subject to MACT standards under § 63.562(b)(2), (3), (4), and (5), and (d)(2) shall determine the reduction of HAP emissions, as VOC, for all combustion or recovery devices other than flares. Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests. Sources subject to RACT standards under § 63.562(c)(3), (4), and (5), and (d)(2) shall determine the reduction of VOC emissions for all combustion or recovery devices other than flares.
              (2) Performance test exemptions. An initial performance test required in this section and in § 63.565(d) and the continuous monitoring in § 63.564(e) is not required in the following cases:
              (i) When a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 Megawatts or less is used to comply with § 63.562(b)(2), (3), or (4), (c)(3) or (4), or (d)(2) and the vent stream is used as the primary fuel or with the primary fuel;
              (ii) When a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 Megawatts or greater is used to comply with § 63.562(b)(2), (3) or (4), (c)(3) or (4), or (d)(2); or
              (iii) When a boiler subject to 40 CFR part 266, subpart H, “Hazardous Waste Burned in Industrial Furnaces,” that has demonstrated 99.99 percent destruction or recovery efficiency is used to comply with § 63.562(b)(2), (3), or (4), (c)(3) or (4), or (d)(2).
              (3) Operation and maintenance inspections. If the 3-hour or 3-cycle block average operating parameters in paragraphs (b)(4) through (9) of this section, outside the acceptable operating ranges, are measured and recorded, i.e., variances of the pollution control device or monitoring equipment, the owner or operator of the affected source shall perform an unscheduled inspection of the control device and monitoring equipment and review of the parameter monitoring data. The owner or operator of the affected source shall perform an inspection and review when total parameter variance time for the control device is greater than 10 percent of the operating time for marine tank vessel loading operations on a 30-day, rolling-average basis. The inspection and review shall be conducted within 24 hours after passing the allowable variance time of 10 percent. The inspection checklist from the requirements of § 63.562(e)(2)(iii) and the monitoring data from requirements in §§ 63.562(e)(2)(ii) and 63.564 should be used to identify any maintenance problems that may be associated with the variance. The unscheduled inspection should encompass all components of the control device and monitoring equipment that can be inspected while in operation. If any maintenance problem is identified during the inspection, the owner or operator of the affected source must take corrective action (e.g., adjustments to operating controls, etc.) as soon as practicable. If no immediate maintenance problems are identified from the inspection performed while the equipment is operating, a complete inspection in accordance with § 63.562(e)(2) must be conducted prior to the next marine tank vessel loading operation and corrective action (e.g., replacement of defective parts) must be taken as soon as practicable for any maintenance problem identified during the complete inspection.
              (4) Combustion device, except flare. During the initial performance test required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the efficiency of and/or the outlet VOC concentration from the combustion device used to comply with § 63.562(b)(2), (3), and (4), (c)(3) and (4), and (d)(2) using the test methods in § 63.565(d). The owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section.
              (i) Outlet VOC concentration limit for required percent combustion efficiency. The owner or operator shall establish as an operating parameter the baseline VOC concentration using the procedures described in § 63.565(g).

              (5) Flare. During the initial performance test required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall establish that the flare used to comply with the emissions standards in § 63.562(b)(2), (3), and (4), (c)(3) and (4), and (d)(2) is in compliance with the design requirements for flares cited in § 63.565(e). Following the date on which the initial determination of compliance is established, the facility shall operate with the presence of a pilot flame in the flare, as determined in § 63.564(f).
              (6) Carbon adsorber. During the initial performance test required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the efficiency of and/or the outlet VOC concentration from the recovery device used to comply with § 63.562(b)(2), (3), (4), and (5), (c)(3), (4), and (5), and (d)(2) using the test methods in § 63.565(d). The owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (b)(6)(i) as well as either paragraph (b)(6)(ii) or (iii) of this section. The owner or operator of affected sources complying with paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section shall conduct a performance test once each year.
              
              (i) Compliance determination for carbon bed regeneration. Desorbed hydrocarbons from regeneration of the off-line carbon bed shall be vented to the on-line carbon bed.

              (iv) Submit a notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.
              (5) Additional initial notification requirements. (i) The owner or operator of sources subject to § 63.562(b)(2), (3), and (4), MACT standards, shall also include in the initial notification report required by paragraph (b)(2) and (3) the 24-month annual average or the annual actual HAP emissions from marine tank vessel loading operations, as appropriate, at all loading berths, as calculated according to the procedures in § 63.565(l). Emissions will be reported by commodity and type of marine tank vessel (barge or tanker) loaded.
              (ii) As an alternative to reporting the information in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the source may submit documentation showing that all HAP-containing marine tank vessel loading operations, not exempt by § 63.560(d), occurred using vapor tight vessels that comply with the procedures of § 63.563(a) and that the emissions were routed to control devices meeting the requirements specified in § 63.563(b).
              (c) Request for extension of compliance. If the owner or operator has installed BACT or technology to meet LAER consistent with § 63.6(i)(5) of subpart A of this part, he/she may submit to the Administrator (or State with an approved permit program) a request for an extension of compliance as specified in § 63.6(i)(4)(i)(B), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of subpart A of this part.
              (d) Reporting for performance testing of flares. The owner or operator of a source required to conduct an opacity performance test shall report the opacity results and other information required by § 63.565(e) and § 63.11 of subpart A of this part with the notification of compliance status.
              (e) Summary reports and excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports—(1) Schedule for summary report and excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports. Excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances are defined in § 63.563(b). The owner or operator of a source subject to these emissions standards that is required to install a CMS shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report and/or a summary report to the Administrator once each year, except, when the source experiences excess emissions, the source shall comply with a semi-annual reporting format until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is approved.
              (2) Request to reduce frequency of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports. An owner or operator who is required to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance and summary reports on a semi-annual basis may reduce the frequency of reporting to annual if the following conditions are met:
              (i) For 1 full year the sources's excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports continually demonstrate that the source is in compliance; and
              (ii) The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and subpart A of this part.
              (3) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance and summary reports required may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgement about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.
              (4) Content and submittal dates for excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports. All excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports and all summary reports, if required per paragraph (e)(5) and (6) of this section, shall be delivered or postmarked within 30 days following the end of each calendar year, or within 30 days following the end of each six month period, if appropriate. Written reports of excess emissions or exceedances of process or control system parameters shall include all information required in § 63.10(c)(5) through (13) of subpart A of this part as applicable in Table 1 of § 63.560 and information from any calibration tests in which the monitoring equipment is not in compliance with PS 8 or other methods used for accuracy testing of temperature, pressure, or flow monitoring devices. The written report shall also include the name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report. When no excess emissions or exceedances have occurred or monitoring equipment has not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted, such information shall be stated in the report. This information will be kept for a minimum of 5 years and made readily available to the Administrator or delegated State authority upon request.

              (5) If the total duration of excess emissions or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is less than 5 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, and CMS downtime for the reporting period is less than 10 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, only the summary report of § 63.10(e)(3)(vi) of subpart A of this part shall be submitted, and the full excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report of paragraph (e)(4) of this section need not be submitted unless required by the Administrator.
              (6) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, or the total CMS downtime for the reporting period is 10 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, both the summary report of § 63.10(e)(3)(vi) of subpart A of this part and the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report of paragraph (e)(4) of this section shall be submitted.
              (f) Vapor collection system of the terminal. Each owner or operator of an affected source shall submit with the initial performance test and maintain in an accessible location on site an engineering report describing in detail the vent system, or vapor collection system, used to vent each vent stream to a control device. This report shall include all valves and vent pipes that could vent the stream to the atmosphere, thereby bypassing the control device, and identify which valves are car-sealed opened and which valves are car-sealed closed.
              (g) If a vent system, or vapor collection system, containing valves that could divert the emission stream away from the control device is used, each owner or operator of an affected source shall keep for at least 5 years up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of:
              (1) All periods when flow bypassing the control device is indicated if flow indicators are installed under § 63.563(a)(1) and § 63.564(b), and
              (2) All times when maintenance is performed on car-sealed valves, when the car-seal is broken, and when the valve position is changed (i.e., from open to closed for valves in the vent piping to the control device and from closed to open for valves that vent the stream directly or indirectly to the atmosphere bypassing the control device) if valves are monitored under § 63.564(b).
              (h) The owner or operator of an affected source shall keep the vapor-tightness documentation required under § 63.563(a)(4) on file at the source in a permanent form available for inspection.
              (i) Vapor tightness test documentation for marine tank vessels. The owner or operator of an affected source shall maintain a documentation file for each marine tank vessel loaded at that source to reflect current test results as determined by the appropriate method in § 63.565(c)(1) and (2). Updates to this documentation file shall be made at least once per year. The owner or operator shall include, as a minimum, the following information in this documentation:
              (1) Test title;
