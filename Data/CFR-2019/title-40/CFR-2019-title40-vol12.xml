      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(1) You must monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device that you use as specified in Table 3 to this subpart and establish the applicable limit or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, determine the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test.</P>

              <P>(A) The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber and of the flow rate of the absorber liquid to each absorber in the process absorbing system, or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, is ±20 percent of the baseline average value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.</P>

              <P>(B) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you may establish allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber, or secondary voltage for an electrostatic precipitator, for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart using the procedures described in this paragraph. You must establish the allowable ranges based on the baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests, or the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph. You must conduct all performance tests using the methods specified in § 63.606. You must certify that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the <PRTPAGE P="18"/>performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, you must determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges.</P>
              <P>(2) You must monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 4 to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) You must comply with the calibration and quality control requirements that are applicable to the operating parameter(s) you monitor as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) If you use a non-regenerative adsorption system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

              <P>(e) If you use a non-regenerative adsorption system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Determine the adsorber bed life (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the expected life of the sorbent in the adsorption system) using the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If the adsorber bed is expected (designed) to have a life of less than 2 years, determine the outlet concentration of mercury on a quarterly basis until breakthrough occurs for the first three adsorber bed change-outs. The adsorber bed life shall equal the average length of time between each of the three change-outs.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the adsorber bed is expected (designed) to have a life of 2 years or greater, determine the outlet concentration of mercury on a semi-annual basis until breakthrough occurs for the first two adsorber bed change-outs. The adsorber bed life must equal the average length of time between each of the two change-outs.</P>
              <P>(iii) If more than one adsorber is operated in parallel, or there are several identical operating lines controlled by adsorbers, you may determine the adsorber bed life by measuring the outlet concentration of mercury from one of the adsorbers or adsorber systems rather than determining the bed life for each adsorber.</P>
              <P>(iv) The adsorber or adsorber system you select for the adsorber bed life test must have the highest expected inlet gas mercury concentration and the highest operating rate of any adsorber in operation at the affected source. During the test to determine adsorber bed life, you must use the fuel that contains the highest level of mercury in any fuel-burning unit associated with the adsorption system being tested.</P>
              <P>(2) You must replace the sorbent in each adsorber on or before the end of the adsorbent bed life, calculated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) You must re-establish the adsorber bed life if the sorbent is replaced with a different brand or type, or if any process changes are made that would lead to a shorter bed lifetime.</P>
              <P>(f) Beginning August 19, 2016, if you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, then the fabric filter must be equipped with a bag leak detection system that is installed, calibrated, maintained, and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Install a bag leak detection sensor(s) in a position(s) that will be representative of the relative or absolute particulate matter loadings for each exhaust stack, roof vent, or compartment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for a positive-pressure fabric filter) of the fabric filter.</P>
              <P>(2) Use a bag leak detection system certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic feet) or less.</P>

              <P>(3) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously <PRTPAGE P="19"/>record the output signal from the system sensor.</P>
              <P>(4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will trigger an alarm when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located such that the alert is observed readily by plant operating personnel.</P>
              <P>(5) Install a bag leak detection system in each compartment or cell for positive-pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments or cells to a common stack. Install a bag leak detector downstream of the fabric filter if a negative-pressure or induced-air filter system is used. If multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</P>
              <P>(6) Calibration of the bag leak detection system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output level by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.</P>
              <P>(7) After initial adjustment, you must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time except as established in your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.608(c). In no event may the sensitivity be increased more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete inspection of the fabric filter system that demonstrates that the system is in good operating condition.</P>

              <P>(8) Operate and maintain each fabric filter and bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, it is considered an operating parameter exceedance. Calculate the alarm time (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> time that the alarm sounds) as specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that corrective action is not required, the alarm duration is not counted in the alarm time calculation.</P>
              <P>(ii) If corrective action is required, each alarm time is counted as a minimum of 1 hour.</P>
              <P>(iii) If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.</P>
              <P>(9) If the alarm on a bag leak detection system is triggered, you must initiate procedures within 1 hour of an alarm to identify the cause of the alarm and then initiate corrective action, as specified in § 63.608(d)(2), no later than 48 hours after an alarm. Failure to take these actions within the prescribed time periods is considered a violation.</P>
              <P>(10) Retain records of any bag leak detection system alarm, including the date, time, duration, and the percent of the total operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds, with a brief explanation of the cause of the alarm, the corrective action taken, and the schedule and duration of the corrective action.</P>
              <P>(g) If you choose to directly monitor mercury emissions instead of using CPMS as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, then you must install and operate a mercury CEMS in accordance with Performance Specification 12A of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, or a sorbent trap-based integrated monitoring system in accordance with Performance Specification 12B of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. You must continuously monitor mercury emissions as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The span value for any mercury CEMS must include the intended upper limit of the mercury concentration measurement range during normal operation, which may be exceeded during other short-term conditions lasting less than 24 consecutive operating hours. However, the span should be at least equivalent to approximately two times the emissions standard. You may round the span value to the nearest multiple of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of total mercury.</P>

              <P>(2) You must operate and maintain each mercury CEMS or sorbent trap-based integrated monitoring system <PRTPAGE P="20"/>according to the quality assurance requirements specified in Procedure 5 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) You must conduct relative accuracy testing of mercury monitoring systems, as specified in Performance Specification 12A, Performance Specification 12B, or Procedure 5 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, at normal operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(4) If you use a mercury CEMS, you must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the exhaust gas flow rate to the atmosphere according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.608(c).</P>

              <P>(vi) Shutting down the process controlled by the fabric filter.</P>
              <P>(e) If you use blower design capacity to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section calculations showing how you determined the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber based on the blower's specifications (including any adjustments you made for pressure drop).</P>
              <P>(f) If you use a regression model to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section the calculations that were used to develop the regression model, including the calculations you use to convert amperage of the blower to brake horsepower. You must describe any constants included in the equations (e.g., efficiency, power factor), and describe how these constants were determined. If you want to change a constant in your calculation, then you must conduct a regression model verification to confirm the new value of the constant. In addition, the site-specific monitoring plan must be updated annually to reflect the data used in the annual regression model verification that is described in Table 3 to this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Operating and monitoring requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For each phosphate fertilizer process line (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), or granular triple superphosphate process line subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system (CMS) according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.628(c). The CMS must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range and must determine and permanently record the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing material fed to the process.</P>
              <P>(2) Maintain a daily record of equivalent P<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">5</E> feed. Calculate the equivalent P<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">5</E> feed by determining the total mass rate in metric ton/hour of phosphorus bearing feed using the procedures specified in § 63.626(f)(3).</P>

              <P>(b) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must maintain an accurate record of the mass of granular triple superphosphate in storage to permit the determination of the amount of equivalent P<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">5</E> stored.</P>
              <P>(c) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Maintain a daily record of total equivalent P<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">5</E> stored by multiplying the percentage P<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">5</E> content, as determined by § 63.626(f)(3)(ii), by the total mass of granular triple superphosphate stored as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Develop for approval by the Administrator a site-specific methodology including sufficient recordkeeping for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with § 63.622(b).</P>
              <P>(d) If you use a control device(s) to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you must install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) You must monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device that you use as specified in Table 3 to this subpart and establish the applicable limit or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, determine the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you use an absorber to comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you monitor pressure drop across the absorber, you must establish allowable ranges using the methodology specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber and of the flow rate of the absorber liquid to each absorber in the process absorbing system, or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, is ±20 percent of the baseline average value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the <PRTPAGE P="36"/>adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.</P>
              <P>(B) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you may establish allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart using the procedures described in this paragraph. You must establish the allowable ranges based on the baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests or the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph. You must conduct all performance tests using the methods specified in § 63.626. You must certify that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, you must determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges.</P>
              <P>(2) You must monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 4 to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) You must comply with the calibration and quality control requirements that are applicable to the operating parameter(s) you monitor as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) If you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, the system must meet the requirements for fabric filters specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Beginning August 19, 2016, if you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, then the fabric filter must be equipped with a bag leak detection system that is installed, calibrated, maintained and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (10) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Install a bag leak detection sensor(s) in a position(s) that will be representative of the relative or absolute particulate matter loadings for each exhaust stack, roof vent, or compartment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for a positive-pressure fabric filter) of the fabric filter.</P>
              <P>(2) Use a bag leak detection system certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic feet) or less.</P>
              <P>(3) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the system sensor.</P>
              <P>(4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will trigger an alarm when an increase in relative particulate material emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located such that the alert is observed readily by plant operating personnel.</P>
              <P>(5) Install a bag leak detection system in each compartment or cell for positive-pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments or cells to a common stack. Install a bag leak detector downstream of the fabric filter if a negative-pressure or induced-air filter is used. If multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</P>
              <P>(6) Calibration of the bag leak detection system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output level by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.</P>
              <P>(7) After initial adjustment, you must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time, except as established in your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.628(c). In no event may the sensitivity be increased more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete inspection of the fabric filter system that demonstrates that the system is in good operating condition.</P>

              <P>(8) Operate and maintain each fabric filter and bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month <PRTPAGE P="37"/>period, it is considered an operating parameter exceedance.

              <P>(vi) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c), (e)(1), (e)(2)(i).</P>

              <P>(2) You must include a schedule for conducting initial and subsequent performance evaluations in the site-specific monitoring plan.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
              </P>

              <P>(3) You must keep the site-specific monitoring plan on site for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If you revise the site-specific monitoring plan, you must keep previous (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> superseded) versions of the plan on site to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. You must include the program of corrective action required under § 63.8(d)(2) in the plan.</P>
              <P>(d) For each bag leak detection system installed to comply with the requirements specified in § 63.625(e), you must include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> calibrations), including how the alarm set-point will be established.</P>
              <P>(2) A corrective action plan describing corrective actions to be taken and the timing of those actions when the bag leak detection alarm sounds. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the actions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other conditions that may cause an increase in regulated material emissions.</P>
              <P>(ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.</P>
              <P>(iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.</P>

              <P>(vi) Shutting down the process controlled by the fabric filter.</P>
              <P>(e) If you use blower design capacity to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section calculations showing how you determined the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber based on the blower's specifications (including any adjustments you made for pressure drop).</P>
              <P>(f) If you use a regression model to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section the calculations that were used to develop the regression model, including the calculations you use to convert amperage of the blower to brake horsepower. You must describe any constants included in the equations (e.g., efficiency, power factor), and describe how these constants were determined. If you want to change a constant in your calculation, then you must conduct a regression model verification to confirm the new value of the constant. In addition, the site-specific monitoring plan must be updated annually to reflect the data used in the annual regression model verification that is described in Table 3 to this subpart.</P>

              <P>(7) All storage vessels and equipment leaks associated with a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station classified under Standard Industrial Classification code 2911 located within a contiguous area and under common control with a refinery meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(8) All heat exchange systems, as defined in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(9) All releases associated with the decoking operations of a delayed coking unit, as defined in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) The affected source subject to this subpart does not include the emission points listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Stormwater from segregated stormwater sewers;</P>
              <P>(2) Spills;</P>
              <P>(3) Any pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, or instrumentation system that is intended to operate in organic hazardous air pollutant service, as defined in § 63.641 of this subpart, for less than 300 hours during the calendar year;</P>
              <P>(4) Catalytic cracking unit and catalytic reformer catalyst regeneration vents, and sulfur plant vents; and</P>
              <P>(5) Emission points routed to a fuel gas system, as defined in § 63.641, provided that on and after January 30, 2019, any flares receiving gas from that fuel gas system are subject to § 63.670. No other testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting is required for refinery fuel gas systems or emission points routed to refinery fuel gas systems.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator of a storage vessel constructed on or before August 18, 1994, shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section to determine whether a storage vessel is part of a source to which this subpart applies. The owner or operator of a storage vessel constructed after August 18, 1994, shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2)(i), and (e)(2)(ii) of this section to determine whether a storage vessel is part of a source to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(1) Where a storage vessel is used exclusively by a process unit, the storage vessel shall be considered part of that process unit.</P>
              <P>(i) If the process unit is a petroleum refining process unit subject to this subpart, then the storage vessel is part of the affected source to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the process unit is not subject to this subpart, then the storage vessel is not part of the affected source to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(2) If a storage vessel is not dedicated to a single process unit, then the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If a storage vessel is shared among process units and one of the process units has the predominant use, as determined by paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, then the storage vessel is part of that process unit.</P>

              <P>(A) If the greatest input on a volume basis into the storage vessel is from a process unit that is located on the same plant site, then that process unit has the predominant use.<PRTPAGE P="51"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) If the greatest input on a volume basis into the storage vessel is provided from a process unit that is not located on the same plant site, then the predominant use shall be the process unit that receives the greatest amount of material on a volume basis from the storage vessel at the same plant site.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a storage vessel is shared among process units so that there is no single predominant use, and at least one of those process units is a petroleum refining process unit subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be considered to be part of the petroleum refining process unit that is subject to this subpart. If more than one petroleum refining process unit is subject to this subpart, the owner or operator may assign the storage vessel to any of the petroleum refining process units subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then the applicability of this subpart shall be determined based on the utilization of that storage vessel during the year preceding August 18, 1995. This determination shall be reported as specified in § 63.655(h)(6)(ii).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emissions averaging provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.642(g) by using emissions averaging according to § 63.642(l) rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651. Existing marine tank vessel loading operations located at the Valdez Marine Terminal source may not comply with the standard by using emissions averaging.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.653(d) for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan shall identify all emission points to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.641) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average.</P>
              <P>(c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point:</P>
              <P>(1) Group 2 emission points;</P>

              <P>(2) Group 1 storage vessels, Group 1 wastewater streams, Group 1 gasoline <PRTPAGE P="84"/>loading racks, Group 1 marine tank vessels, and Group 1 miscellaneous process vents that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percentages of reduction for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead.</P>
              <P>(d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:</P>
              <P>(1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990;</P>
              <P>(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting only the specifications stated in the reference control technology definition in § 63.641 (i.e., that meets the specifications of § 63.119(b) of subpart G but does not have controlled fittings per § 63.119 (b)(5) and (b)(6) of subpart G) applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control;</P>
              <P>(3) Emission points on shutdown process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits;</P>
              <P>(4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. Group 1 wastewater streams cannot be left undercontrolled or uncontrolled to generate debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms “wastewater” and “wastewater stream” are used to mean process wastewater; and</P>
              <P>(5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.</P>
              <P>(e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.</P>

              <P>(2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section <PRTPAGE P="85"/>may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.</P>
              <P>(3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(ii) After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations.</P>
              <P>(4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.</P>
              <P>(5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.655(g)(8). Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.655(g)(8)(iii).</P>
              <P>(f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following:</P>
              <P>(1) More than 20 individual emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) For emission points for which continuous monitors are used, periods of excess emissions as defined in § 63.655(g)(6)(i). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.</P>
              <P>(ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section to demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned.</P>
              <P>(g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:</P>

              <P>(ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: Substitution of feedstocks that reduce HAP emissions, alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment, equipment modifications; housekeeping measures, and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.</P>
              <P>(2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990 can be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percentage of reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(4) of this section is the difference in percentage between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.</P>
              <P>(ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the percentage of reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.</P>

The owner or operator of an affected heat exchange system may choose to comply with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for some heat exchange systems at the petroleum refinery and comply with paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for other heat exchange systems. However, for each affected heat exchange system, the owner or operator of an affected heat exchange system must elect one monitoring alternative that will apply at all times. If the owner or operator intends to change the monitoring alternative that applies to a heat exchange system, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of such a change. All “leaks” identified prior to changing monitoring alternatives must be repaired. The monitoring frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section also apply to the inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system, if monitoring of the inlet water feed is elected as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) Determine the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring location is an individual cooling tower riser, determine the total cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. Volumetric flow measurements may be used and converted to mass flow rates using the density of water at the specific monitoring location temperature or using the default density of water at 25 degrees Celsius, which is 997 kilograms per cubic meter or 8.32 pounds per gallon.</P>
              <P>(iii) For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of the leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring interval by multiplying the leak concentration in the cooling water, ppmw, determined in (g)(4)(i) of this section, by the mass flow rate of the cooling water determined in (g)(4)(ii) of this section and by the duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on the day the repair would have had to be completed if the repair had not been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the of the current monitoring event.</P>
              <P>(iv) For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval by the leak concentration and cooling water flow rates determined for the last monitoring event prior to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the time of the re-monitoring event that verified that the leak was repaired.</P>

              <P>(10)(i) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) in the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator <PRTPAGE P="121"/>in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date(s) and time(s) the CDX or CEDRI were unavailable when you attempted to access it in the 5 business days prior to the submission deadline; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(ii) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this paragraph, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.</P>

Upon approval of the site-specific monitoring plan, the background sampler(s) should be operated co-currently with the routine samplers.</P>

              <P>(3) If there are 19 or fewer monitoring locations, the owner or operator shall collect at least one co-located duplicate sample per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. If there are 20 or more monitoring locations, the owner or operator shall collect at least two co-located duplicate samples per sampling period and <PRTPAGE P="131"/>at least one field blank per sampling period. The co-located duplicates may be collected at any of the perimeter sampling.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall follow the procedure in Section 9.6 of Method 325B of appendix A of this part to determine the detection limit of benzene for each sampler used to collect samples, background samples (if the owner or operator elects to do so), co-located samples and blanks.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator shall collect and record meteorological data according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) If a near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section or if an alternative test method is used that provides time-resolved measurements, the owner or operator shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Use an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) Collect and record hourly average meteorological data, including temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction and calculate daily unit vector wind direction and daily sigma theta.</P>
              <P>(2) For cases other than those specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall collect and record sampling period average temperature and barometric pressure using either an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part or, alternatively, using data from a United States Weather Service (USWS) meteorological station provided the USWS meteorological station is within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of the refinery.</P>
              <P>(3) If an on-site meteorological station is used, the owner or operator shall follow the calibration and standardization procedures for meteorological measurements in EPA-454/B-08-002 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator shall use a sampling period and sampling frequency as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling period.</E> A 14-day sampling period shall be used, unless a shorter sampling period is determined to be necessary under paragraph (g) or (i) of this section. A sampling period is defined as the period during which sampling tube is deployed at a specific sampling location with the diffusive sampling end cap in-place and does not include the time required to analyze the sample. For the purpose of this subpart, a 14-day sampling period may be no shorter than 13 calendar days and no longer than 15 calendar days, but the routine sampling period shall be 14 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Base sampling frequency.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the frequency of sample collection shall be once each contiguous 14-day sampling period, such that the beginning of the next 14-day sampling period begins immediately upon the completion of the previous 14-day sampling period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative sampling frequency for burden reduction.</E> When an individual monitor consistently achieves results at or below 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the owner or operator may elect to use the applicable minimum sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for that monitoring site. When calculating Δc for the monitoring period when using this alternative for burden reduction, zero shall be substituted for the sample result for the monitoring site for any period where a sample is not taken.</P>

              <P>(i) If every sample at a monitoring site is at or below 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> for 2 years (52 consecutive samples), every other sampling period can be skipped for that monitoring site, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> sampling will occur approximately once per month.</P>

              <P>(ii) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> for 2 years (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 26 consecutive “monthly” samples), five 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that monitoring site following each period of sampling, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> sampling will occur approximately once per quarter.</P>

              <P>(iii) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> for 2 years (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 8 consecutive quarterly samples), twelve 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that monitoring site <PRTPAGE P="132"/>following each period of sampling, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> sampling will occur twice a year.</P>

              <P>(iv) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> for 2 years (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 4 consecutive semiannual samples), only one sample per year is required for that monitoring site. For yearly sampling, samples shall occur at least 10 months but no more than 14 months apart.</P>

              <P>(v) If at any time a sample for a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section returns a result that is above 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the sampling site must return to the original sampling requirements of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for one quarter (six 14-day sampling periods). If every sample collected during this quarter is at or below 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> , the owner or operator may revert back to the reduced monitoring schedule applicable for that monitoring site prior to the sample reading exceeding 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> If any sample collected during this quarter is above 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, that monitoring site must return to the original sampling requirements of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for a minimum of two years. The burden reduction requirements can be used again for that monitoring site once the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section are met again, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> after 52 contiguous 14-day samples with no results above 0.9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> .</P>
              <P>(f) Within 45 days of completion of each sampling period, the owner or operator shall determine whether the results are above or below the action level as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall determine the facility impact on the benzene concentration (Δc) for each 14-day sampling period according to either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) Except when near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the highest and lowest sample results for benzene concentrations from the sample pool and calculate Δc as the difference in these concentrations. Co-located samples must be averaged together for the purposes of determining the benzene concentration for that sampling location, and, if applicable, for determining Δc. The owner or operator shall adhere to the following procedures when one or more samples for the sampling period are below the method detection limit for benzene:</P>
              <P>(A) If the lowest detected value of benzene is below detection, the owner or operator shall use zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.</P>
              <P>(B) If all sample results are below the method detection limit, the owner or operator shall use the method detection limit as the highest sample result and zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.</P>
              <P>(ii) When near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine Δc using the calculation protocols outlined in the approved site-specific monitoring plan and in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall calculate the annual average Δc based on the average of the 26 most recent 14-day sampling periods. The owner or operator shall update this annual average value after receiving the results of each subsequent 14-day sampling period.</P>
              <P>(3) The action level for benzene is 9 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) on an annual average basis. If the annual average Δc value for benzene is less than or equal to 9 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the concentration is below the action level. If the annual average Δc value for benzene is greater than 9 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the concentration is above the action level, and the owner or operator shall conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

              <P>(g) Within 5 days of determining that the action level has been exceeded for any annual average Δc and no longer than 50 days after completion of the sampling period, the owner or operator shall initiate a root cause analysis to determine the cause of such exceedance and to determine appropriate corrective action, such as those described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section. The root cause analysis and initial corrective action analysis shall <PRTPAGE P="133"/>be completed and initial corrective actions taken no later than 45 days after determining there is an exceedance. Root cause analysis and corrective action may include, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Leak inspection using Method 21 of part 60, appendix A-7 of this chapter and repairing any leaks found.</P>
              <P>(2) Leak inspection using optical gas imaging and repairing any leaks found.</P>
              <P>(3) Visual inspection to determine the cause of the high benzene emissions and implementing repairs to reduce the level of emissions.</P>

              <P>(4) Employing progressively more frequent sampling, analysis and meteorology (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> using shorter sampling periods for Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A of this part, or using active sampling techniques).</P>
              <P>(h) If, upon completion of the corrective action analysis and corrective actions such as those described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Δc value for the next 14-day sampling period for which the sampling start time begins after the completion of the corrective actions is greater than 9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> or if all corrective action measures identified require more than 45 days to implement, the owner or operator shall develop a corrective action plan that describes the corrective action(s) completed to date, additional measures that the owner or operator proposes to employ to reduce fenceline concentrations below the action level, and a schedule for completion of these measures. The owner or operator shall submit the corrective action plan to the Administrator within 60 days after receiving the analytical results indicating that the Δc value for the 14-day sampling period following the completion of the initial corrective action is greater than 9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> or, if no initial corrective actions were identified, no later than 60 days following the completion of the corrective action analysis required in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) An owner or operator may request approval from the Administrator for a site-specific monitoring plan to account for offsite upwind sources or onsite sources excluded under § 63.640(g) according to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall prepare and submit a site-specific monitoring plan and receive approval of the site-specific monitoring plan prior to using the near-field source alternative calculation for determining Δc provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The site-specific monitoring plan shall include, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The procedures in Section 12 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part are not required, but may be used, if applicable, when determining near-field source contributions.</P>
              <P>(i) Identification of the near-field source or sources. For onsite sources, documentation that the onsite source is excluded under § 63.640(g) and identification of the specific provision in § 63.640(g) that applies to the source.</P>
              <P>(ii) Location of the additional monitoring stations that shall be used to determine the uniform background concentration and the near-field source concentration contribution.</P>
              <P>(iii) Identification of the fenceline monitoring locations impacted by the near-field source. If more than one near-field source is present, identify the near-field source or sources that are expected to contribute to the concentration at that monitoring location.</P>
              <P>(iv) A description of (including sample calculations illustrating) the planned data reduction and calculations to determine the near-field source concentration contribution for each monitoring location.</P>
              <P>(v) If more frequent monitoring or a monitoring station other than a passive diffusive tube monitoring station is proposed, provide a detailed description of the measurement methods, measurement frequency, and recording frequency for determining the uniform background or near-field source concentration contribution.</P>
              <P>(2) When an approved site-specific monitoring plan is used, the owner or operator shall determine Δc for comparison with the 9 µg/m<SU>3</SU> action level using the requirements specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(C) An explanation of the conditions that ensure that the flare gas net heating value is consistent and, if flare gas net heating value is expected to vary (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> due to product loading of different material), the conditions expected to produce the flare gas with the lowest net heating value;</P>
              <P>(D) The supporting test results from sampling the requested flare gas stream/system for the net heating value. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily measurement values (14 grab samples) for frequently operated flare gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. If the flare gas stream composition can vary, samples must be taken during those conditions expected to result in lowest net heating value identified in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(C) of this section. The owner or operator shall determine net heating value for the gas stream using either gas composition analysis or net heating value monitor (with optional hydrogen concentration analyzer) according to the method provided in paragraph (l) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(E) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of net heating values expected for the flare gas stream/system going to the affected flare (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “the samples are representative of typical operating conditions of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare” or “the samples are representative of conditions expected to yield the lowest net heating value of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare”).</P>
              <P>(F) The net heating value to be used for all flows of the flare vent gas from the flare gas stream/system covered in the application. A single net heating value must be assigned to the flare vent gas either by selecting the lowest net heating value measured in the sampling program or by determining the 95th percent confidence interval on the mean value of all samples collected using the t-distribution statistic (which is 1.943 for 7 grab samples or 1.771 for 14 grab samples).</P>
              <P>(ii) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (j)(6)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="142"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is still within the range of net heating values included in the original application, the owner or operator shall determine the net heating value on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application is still appropriate.</P>
              <P>(B) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is lower than the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).</P>

              <P>(C) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value has greater variability in the flare gas stream/system such the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin monitoring the composition or net heat content of the flare vent gas stream using the methods in this section (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> grab samples every 8 hours until such time a continuous monitor, if elected, is installed).</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Calculation methods for cumulative flow rates and determining compliance with Vtip operating limits</E>. The owner or operator shall determine V<E T="52">tip</E> on a 15-minute block average basis according to the following requirements.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall use design and engineering principles to determine the unobstructed cross sectional area of the flare tip. The unobstructed cross sectional area of the flare tip is the total tip area that vent gas can pass through. This area does not include any stability tabs, stability rings, and upper steam or air tubes because flare vent gas does not exit through them.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall determine the cumulative volumetric flow of flare vent gas for each 15-minute block average period using the data from the continuous flow monitoring system required in paragraph (i) of this section according to the following requirements, as applicable. If desired, the cumulative flow rate for a 15-minute block period only needs to include flow during those periods when regulated material is sent to the flare, but owners or operators may elect to calculate the cumulative flow rates across the entire 15-minute block period for any 15-minute block period where there is regulated material flow to the flare.</P>
              <P>(i) Use set 15-minute time periods starting at 12 midnight to 12:15 a.m., 12:15 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. and so on concluding at 11:45 p.m. to midnight when calculating 15-minute block average flow volumes.</P>

              <P>(ii) If continuous pressure/temperature monitoring system(s) and engineering calculations are used as allowed under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, at a minimum, determine the 15-minute block average temperature and pressure from the monitoring system and use those values to perform the engineering calculations to determine the cumulative flow over the 15-minute block average period. Alternatively, the owner or operator may divide the 15-minute block average period into equal duration subperiods(<E T="03">e.g.</E>, three 5-minute periods) and determine the average temperature and pressure for each subperiod, perform engineering calculations to determine the flow for each subperiod, then add the volumetric flows for the subperiods to determine the cumulative volumetric flow of vent gas for the 15-minute block average period.</P>
              <P>(3) The 15-minute block average V<E T="52">tip</E> shall be calculated using the following equation.</P>

For the purpose of this requirement, use the time that the results become available rather than the time the sample was collected. For example, if a sample is collected at 12:25 a.m. and the analysis is completed at 12:38 a.m., the results are available at 12:38 a.m. and these results would be used to determine compliance during the 15-minute block period from 12:45 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.</P>

              <P>(4) A root cause analysis and corrective action analysis must be completed as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after a flare flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. Special circumstances affecting the number of root cause <PRTPAGE P="149"/>analyses and/or corrective action analyses are provided in paragraphs (o)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single continuous flare flow event that meets both of the criteria in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single continuous flare flow event regardless of the number of 15-minute block periods in which the flare tip velocity was exceeded or the number of 2 hour periods that contain more the 5 minutes of visible emissions.</P>

              <P>(iii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single event that causes two or more flares that are operated in series (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> cascaded flare systems) to have a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single event that causes two or more flares to have a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, regardless of the configuration of the flares, if the root cause is reasonably expected to be a force majeure event, as defined in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(v) Except as provided in paragraphs (o)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section, if more than one flare has a flow event that meets the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section during the same time period, an initial root cause analysis shall be conducted separately for each flare that has a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. If the initial root cause analysis indicates that the flow events have the same root cause(s), the initially separate root cause analyses may be recorded as a single root cause analysis and a single corrective action analysis may be conducted.</P>
              <P>(5) Each owner or operator of a flare required to conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis as specified in paragraphs (o)(3) and (4) of this section shall implement the corrective action(s) identified in the corrective action analysis in accordance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (o)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>

For the purpose of this requirement, a single root cause analysis conducted for an event that met both of the criteria in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section would be counted as an event under each of the separate criteria counts for that flare. Additionally, if a single root cause analysis was conducted for an event that caused multiple flares to meet the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, that event would count as an event for each of the flares for each criteria in paragraph (o)(3) of this section that was met during that event.

              <P>(1) The quality assurance requirements are in table 13 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) The calibration gases must meet one of the following options:</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator must use a calibration gas or multiple gases that include all of compounds listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) through (K) of this section that may be reasonably expected to exist in the flare gas stream and optionally include any of the compounds listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(L) through (O) of this section. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, the owner or operator must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases.</P>
              <P>(A) Hydrogen.</P>

              <P>(H) iso-Butane.</P>

              <P>(I) Butene (general). It is not necessary to separately speciate butene <PRTPAGE P="155"/>isomers, but the net heating value of trans-butene must be used for co-eluting butene isomers.</P>
              <P>(J) 1,3-Butadiene. It is not necessary to separately speciate butadiene isomers, but you must use the response factor and net heating value of 1,3-butadiene for co-eluting butadiene isomers.</P>
              <P>(K) n-Pentane. Use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify all C5+ hydrocarbons.</P>
              <P>(L) Acetylene (optional).</P>

An off-site material management unit is a tank, container, surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system used to manage off-site material. For the purpose of implementing the standards under this subpart, a unit that meets the definition of a tank or container but also is equipped with a vent that serves as a process vent for any of the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section is not an off-site material management unit but instead is a process vent and is to be included in the appropriate affected source group under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Examples of such a unit may include, but are not limited to, a distillate receiver vessel, a primary condenser, a bottoms receiver vessel, a surge control tank, a separator tank, and a hot well.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Process vents.</E> For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located <PRTPAGE P="168"/>at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of process equipment associated with the process vents for the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Distillation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Distillation means a process, either batch or continuous, separating one or more off-site material feed streams into two or more exit streams having different component concentrations from those in the feed stream or streams. The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and vapor phases as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) Fractionation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Fractionation means a liquid mixture separation process or method used to separate a mixture of several volatile components of different boiling points in successive stages, each stage removing from the mixture some proportion of one of the components.</P>
              <P>(iii) Thin-film evaporation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Thin-film evaporation means a liquid mixture separation process or method that uses a heating surface consisting of a large diameter tube that may be either straight or tapered, horizontal or vertical. Liquid is spread on the tube wall by a rotating assembly of blades that maintain a close clearance from the wall or actually ride on the film of liquid on the wall.</P>
              <P>(iv) Solvent extraction process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Solvent extraction means a separation process or method in which a solid or a solution is contacted with a liquid solvent (the material and the solvent being relatively insoluble in each other) to preferentially dissolve and transfer one or more components into the solvent.</P>
              <P>(v) Steam stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Steam stripping means a liquid mixture separation process or method in which vaporization of the volatile components of a liquid mixture occurs by the introduction of steam directly into the process.</P>
              <P>(vi) Gas stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Gas stripping means a desorption process or method used to transfer one or more volatile components from a liquid mixture into a gas stream either with or without the application of heat to the liquid. Packed towers, spray towers, and bubble-cap, sieve, or valve-type plate towers are examples of the process configurations used for contacting the gas and a liquid.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Equipment leaks.</E> For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of equipment components for which each component meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If any one of these conditions do not apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the affected source for equipment leaks.</P>
              <P>(i) The equipment component is a pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system;</P>
              <P>(ii) The equipment component contains or contacts off-site material having a total HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or more during a calendar year in off-site material service, as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Facility-wide exemption.</E> The owner or operator of affected sources subject to this subpart is exempted from the requirements of §§ 63.682 through 63.699 of this subpart in situations when the total annual quantity of the HAP that is contained in the off-site material received at the plant site is less than 1 megagram per year. For a plant site to be exempted under the provisions of this paragraph (d), the owner or operator must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator must prepare an initial determination of the <PRTPAGE P="169"/>total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site. This determination is based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart as determined at the point-of-delivery for each off-site material stream.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator must prepare a new determination whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the off-site material received at the plant site could cause the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site to exceed the limit of 1 megagram per year.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator must maintain documentation to support the owner's or operator's determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site. This documentation must include the basis and data used for determining the HAP content of the off-site material.</P>

              <P>(i) Documentation shall be prepared that presents the information used as the basis for the owner's or operator's knowledge of the off-site material stream's average VOHAP concentration.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Calculations.</E> The average VOHAP concentration (C<AC T="8"/>) a mass-weighted basis shall be calculated by using the results for all samples analyzed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the following equation. An owner or operator using a test method that provides species-specific chemical concentrations may adjust the measured concentrations to the corresponding concentration values which would be obtained had the off-site material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the off-site material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (f<E T="52">m305</E>) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.</P>

Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.</P>
              <P>(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 8.1.1 of Method 21 shall be for the weighted average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit at the time of monitoring, not for each individual organic constituent.</P>
              <P>(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</P>
              <P>(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (k)(8)(i) or (k)(8)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if either of the conditions specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) or (c)(3)(ii)(B) occurs. In this case, the owner or operator must repair the defect the next time the process or unit that vents to the closed-vent system is shutdown. Repair of the defect must be completed before the process or unit resumes operation.</P>
              <P>(A) Completion of the repair is technically infeasible without the shutdown of the process or unit that vents to the closed-vent system.</P>
              <P>(B) The owner or operator determines that the air emissions resulting from the repair of the defect within the specified period would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result by delaying the repair until the next time the process or unit that vents to the closed-vent system is shutdown.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(2) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the cover. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(5) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="214"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) The owner or operator shall repair all detected defects as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator shall make first efforts at repair of the defect no later than 5 calendar days after detection and repair shall be completed as soon as possible but no later than 45 calendar days after detection except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary removal from service of the transfer system and no alternative transfer system is available at the site to accept the material normally handled by the system. In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time the process or unit that is generating the material handled by the transfer system stops operation. Repair of the defect must be completed before the process or unit resumes operation.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Control device monitoring requirements.</E> For each control device required under § 63.693 to be monitored in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (e), the owner or operator must ensure that each control device operates properly by monitoring the control device in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) A continuous parameter monitoring system must be used to measure the operating parameter or parameters specified for the control device in § 63.693(d) through § 63.693(g) of this subpart as applicable to the type and design of the control device. The continuous parameter monitoring system must meet the following specifications and requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The continuous parameter monitoring system must measure either an instantaneous value at least once every 15 minutes or an average value for intervals of 15 minutes or less and continuously record either:</P>
              <P>(A) Each measured data value; or</P>
              <P>(B) Each block average value for each 1-hour period or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average instead of all measured values.</P>
              <P>(ii) The monitoring system must be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide reasonable assurance that the monitoring equipment is operating properly.</P>
              <P>(2) Using the data recorded by the monitoring system, the owner or operator must calculate the daily average value for each monitored operating parameter for each operating day. If operation of the control device is continuous, the operating day is a 24-hour period. If control device operation is not continuous, the operating day is the total number of hours of control device operation per 24-hour period. Valid data points must be available for 75 percent of the operating hours in an operating day to compute the daily average.</P>
              <P>(3) For each monitored operating parameter, the owner or operator must establish a minimum operating parameter value or a maximum operating parameter value, as appropriate, to define the range of conditions at which the control device must be operated to continuously achieve the applicable performance requirements specified in § 63.693(b)(2) of this subpart. Each minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) If the owner or operator conducts a performance test to demonstrate control device performance, then the minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established based on values measured during the performance test and supplemented, as necessary, by the control device design specifications, manufacturer recommendations, or other applicable information.<PRTPAGE P="215"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner or operator uses a control device design analysis to demonstrate control device performance, then the minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established based on the control device design analysis and supplemented, as necessary, by the control device manufacturer recommendations or other applicable information.</P>
              <P>(4) A deviation for a given control device is determined to have occurred when the monitoring data or lack of monitoring data result in any one of the criteria specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section being met. When multiple operating parameters are monitored for the same control device and during the same operating day more than one of these operating parameters meets a deviation criterion specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, then a single deviation is determined to have occurred for the control device for that operating day.</P>
              <P>(i) A deviation occurs when the daily average value of a monitored operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit (or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit) established for the operating parameter in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) A deviation occurs when the period of control device operation is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and the monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours. Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.</P>
              <P>(iii) A deviation occurs when the period of control device operation is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than 1 of the hours during the period does not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data. Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.</P>
              <P>(5) For each deviation, except when the deviation occurs during periods of non-operation of the unit or the process that is vented to the control device (resulting in cessation of HAP emissions to which the monitoring applies), the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied control in a manner that achieves the required operating parameter limits. Failure to achieve the required operating parameter limits is a violation of this standard.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Alternative inspection and monitoring interval.</E> Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a piece of air pollution control equipment in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as “unsafe to inspect and monitor.” The documentation must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A <PRTPAGE P="216"/>copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of this subpart apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) Each new and existing magnetic tape manufacturing operation located at a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions; and</P>

              <P>(2) A magnetic tape manufacturing operation for which the owner or operator chooses to use the provisions of § 63.703(b) and (h) to obtain a Federally enforceable limit on its potential to emit HAP.

              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanatory Note:</HD>
                <P>A reason the owner or operator would make the choice described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is if the plant site, without this limit, would be a major source. The owner or operator could use this limit, which would establish the potential to emit from magnetic tape manufacturing operations, in conjunction with the potential to emit from the other HAP emission points at the stationary source, to be an area source. Note, however, that an owner or operator is not required to use the provisions in § 63.703(b) and (h) to determine the potential to emit HAP from magnetic tape manufacturing operations.</P>
              </NOTE>

              <P>(2) Any coating operation that produces a quantity of magnetic tape that is 1 percent or less of total production (in terms of total square footage coated) from that coating operation in any 12-month period.</P>
              <P>(c) The affected source subject to this standard is the magnetic tape manufacturing operation, as defined in § 63.702.</P>

              <P>(2) Within 2 years after the effective date of the standard, if a new add-on air pollution control device is not needed to comply with § 63.703(c) or (g) of these standards.</P>
              <P>(e) The compliance date for an owner or operator of a new affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart is immediately upon startup of the affected source.</P>
              <P>(f) The provisions of this subpart apply during periods of startup and shutdown, and whenever magnetic tape manufacturing operations are taking place.</P>

              <P>(g) Owners or operators of affected sources subject to the provisions of this subpart shall also comply with the requirements of subpart A as identified in Table 1, according to the applicability of subpart A to such sources.<PRTPAGE P="227"/>

              <SECTNO>§ 63.760</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Applicability and designation of affected source.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart applies to the owners and operators of the emission points, specified in paragraph (b) of this section that are located at oil and natural gas production facilities that meet the specified criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Facilities that are major or area sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) as defined in § 63.761. Emissions for major source determination purposes can be estimated using the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, calculated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use the facility's design maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput to estimate the maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with § 63.10(b)(3). A facility that is determined to be an area source, but subsequently increases its emissions or its potential to emit above the major source levels, and becomes a major source, must comply thereafter with all provisions of this subpart applicable to a major source starting on the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.</P>

              <P>(i) If the owner or operator documents, to the Administrator's satisfaction, a decline in annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, each year for the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput used to determine maximum potential emissions according to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. In all <PRTPAGE P="313"/>other circumstances, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum throughput used to determine whether a facility is a major source in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the average of the annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput for the 3 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</P>
              <P>(B) The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the highest annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput over the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual facility natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput each year and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput increases above the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for other parameters used to calculate emissions as the maximum for the period over which the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Parameters, other than glycol circulation rate, shall be based on either highest measured values or annual average. For estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol dehydration units, the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation shall be the unit's maximum rate under its physical and operational design consistent with the definition of potential to emit in § 63.2.</P>
              <P>(2) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store hydrocarbon liquids.</P>
              <P>(3) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store natural gas prior to the point at which natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category or is delivered to a final end user. For the purposes of this subpart, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the natural gas processing plant, when present. If no natural gas processing plant is present, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the point of custody transfer.</P>
              <P>(b) The affected sources for major sources are listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for area sources in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) For area sources, the affected source includes each triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration unit located at a facility that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) Any source that determines it is not a major source but has actual emissions of 5 tons per year or more of a single HAP, or 12.5 tons per year or more of a combination of HAP (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 50 percent of the major source thresholds), shall update its major source determination within 1 year of the prior <PRTPAGE P="314"/>determination or October 15, 2012, whichever is later, and each year thereafter, using gas composition data measured during the preceding 12 months.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner and operator of a facility that does not contain an affected source as specified in paragraph (b) of this section are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> The facilities listed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this subpart. Records shall be maintained as required in § 63.10(b)(3).</P>

              <P>(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Report.</E> The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 63.781</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to shipbuilding and ship repair operations at any facility that is a major source.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings used in volumes of less than 200 liters (52.8 gallons) per year, provided the total volume of coating exempt under this paragraph does not exceed 1,000 liters per year (264 gallons per year) at any facility. Coatings exempt under this paragraph shall be clearly labeled as “low-usage exempt,” and the volume of each such coating applied shall be maintained in the facility's records.</P>
              <P>(c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings applied with hand-held, nonrefillable, aerosol containers or to unsaturated polyester resin (i.e., fiberglass lay-up) coatings. Coatings applied to suitably prepared fiberglass surfaces for protective or decorative purposes are subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) If you are authorized in accordance with 40 CFR 63.783(c) to use an add-on control system as an alternative means of limiting emissions from coating operations, in response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available in response to claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) The excess emissions:</P>
              <P>(A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and</P>
              <P>(B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and</P>

              <P>(C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and<PRTPAGE P="361"/>
              </P>
              <P>(D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; and</P>
              <P>(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health; and</P>
              <P>(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and</P>
              <P>(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</P>
              <P>(viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.</P>

              <P>(a) No owner or operator of any existing or new affected source shall cause or allow the application of any coating to a ship with an as-applied VOHAP content exceeding the applicable limit given in Table 2 of this subpart, as determined by the procedures described in § 63.785 (c)(1) through (c)(4). For the compliance procedures described in § 63.785 (c)(1) through (c)(3), VOC shall be used as a surrogate for VOHAP, and Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used as the definitive measure for determining compliance. For the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(4), an alternative test method capable of measuring independent VOHAP shall be used to determine compliance. The method must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) Each owner or operator of a new or existing affected source shall ensure that:</P>

              <P>(1) At all times the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether <PRTPAGE P="365"/>such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>
              <P>(2) All handling and transfer of VOHAP-containing materials to and from containers, tanks, vats, drums, and piping systems is conducted in a manner that minimizes spills.</P>
              <P>(3) All containers, tanks, vats, drums, and piping systems are free of cracks, holes, and other defects and remain closed unless materials are being added to or removed from them.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval of alternative means of limiting emissions.</E> (1) The owner or operator of an affected source may apply to the Administrator for permission to use an alternative means (such as an add-on control system) of limiting emissions from coating operations. The application must include:</P>
              <P>(i) An engineering material balance evaluation that provides a comparison of the emissions that would be achieved using the alternative means to those that would result from using coatings that comply with the limits in Table 2 of this subpart, or the results from an emission test that accurately measures the capture efficiency and control device efficiency achieved by the control system and the composition of the associated coatings so that the emissions comparison can be made;</P>
              <P>(ii) A proposed monitoring protocol that includes operating parameter values to be monitored for compliance and an explanation of how the operating parameter values will be established through a performance test; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Details of appropriate recordkeeping and reporting procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator shall approve the alternative means of limiting emissions if, in the Administrator's judgment, postcontrol emissions of VOHAP per volume applied solids will be no greater than those from the use of coatings that comply with the limits in Table 2 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may condition approval on operation, maintenance, and monitoring requirements to ensure that emissions from the source are no greater than those that would otherwise result from this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test methods and procedures.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) For the compliance procedures described in § 63.785(c) (1) through (c)(3), <PRTPAGE P="370"/>Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is the definitive method for determining the VOC content of coatings, as supplied or as applied. When a coating or thinner contains exempt compounds that are volatile HAP or VOHAP, the owner or operator shall ensure, when determining the VOC content of a coating, that the mass of these exempt compounds is included.</P>
              <P>(b) For the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(4), the Administrator must approve the test method for determining the VOHAP content of coatings and thinners. As part of the approval, the test method must meet the specified accuracy limits indicated below for sensitivity, duplicates, repeatability, and reproducibility coefficient of variation each determined at the 95 percent confidence limit. Each percentage value below is the corresponding coefficient of variation multiplied by 2.8 as in the ASTM Method E180-93: Standard Practice for Determining the Precision of ASTM Methods for Analysis and Testing of Industrial Chemicals (incorporation by reference—see § 63.14).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sensitivity.</E> The overall sensitivity must be sufficient to identify and calculate at least one mass percent of the compounds of interest based on the original sample. The sensitivity is defined as ten times the noise level as specified in ASTM Method D3257-93: Standard Test Methods for Aromatics in Mineral Spirits by Gas Chromatography (incorporation by reference—see § 63.14). In determining the sensitivity, the level of sample dilution must be factored in.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Repeatability.</E> First, at the 0.1-5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if duplicates vary by more than 6 percent relative and/or day to day variation of mean duplicates by the same analyst exceeds 10 percent relative. Second, at greater than 5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if duplicates vary by more than 5 percent relative and/or day to day variation of duplicates by the same analyst exceeds 5 percent relative.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reproducibility.</E> First, at the 0.1-5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if lab to lab variation exceeds 60 percent relative. Second, at greater than 5 percent range the results would be suspect if lab to lab variation exceeds 20 percent relative.</P>
              <P>(4) Any test method should include information on the apparatus, reagents and materials, analytical procedure, procedure for identification and confirmation of the volatile species in the mixture being analyzed, precision and bias, and other details to be reported. The reporting should also include information on quality assurance (QA) auditing.</P>
              <P>(5) Multiple and different analytical techniques must be used for positive identification if the components in a mixture under analysis are not known. In such cases a single column gas chromatograph (GC) may not be adequate. A combination of equipment may be needed such as a GC/mass spectrometer or GC/infrared system. (If a GC method is used, the operator must use practices in ASTM Method E260-91 or 96: Standard Practice for Gas Chromatography [incorporation by reference—see § 63.14].)</P>
              <P>(c) A coating manufacturer or the owner or operator of an affected source may use batch formulation data as a test method in lieu of Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to certify the as-supplied VOC content of a coating if the manufacturer or the owner or operator has determined that batch formulation data have a consistent and quantitatively known relationship to Method 24 results. This determination shall consider the role of cure volatiles, which may cause emissions to exceed an amount based solely upon coating formulation data. Notwithstanding such determination, in the event of conflicting results, Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall take precedence.</P>

              <P>(d) Each owner or operator of an affected source shall use or ensure that the manufacturer uses the form and procedures mentioned in appendix A of this subpart to determine values for the thinner and coating parameters used in Equations 1 and 2 of this subpart. The owner or operator shall ensure that the coating/thinner manufacturer (or supplier) provides information on the VOC and VOHAP contents of the coatings/thinners and the procedure(s) used to determine these values.<PRTPAGE P="371"/>
              </P>

              <P>(a) The affected source to which this subpart applies is each facility that is engaged, either in part or in whole, in the manufacture of wood furniture or wood furniture components and that is located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, § 63.2. The owner or operator of a source that meets the definition for an incidental wood furniture manufacturer shall maintain purchase or usage records demonstrating that the source meets the definition in § 63.801 of this subpart, but the source shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) A source that complies with the limits and criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section is an area source for the purposes of this subpart and is not subject to any other provision of this rule, provided that: In the case of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), finishing materials, adhesives, cleaning solvents and washoff solvents used for wood furniture or wood furniture component manufacturing operations account for at least 90 percent of annual HAP emissions at the plant site, and if the plant site has HAP emissions that do not originate from the listed materials, the owner or operator shall keep any records necessary to demonstrate that the 90 percent criterion is being met. A source that initially relies on the limits and criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) to become an area source, but subsequently exceeds the relevant limit (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants below major source levels), becomes a major source and must comply thereafter with all applicable provisions of this subpart starting on the applicable compliance date in § 63.800. Nothing in this paragraph (b) is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator of the source uses no more than 250 gallons per month, for every month, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials at the source, including materials used for source categories other than wood furniture (surface coating), but excluding materials used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility, or the use of toxic chemicals contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion). The owner or operator shall maintain records of the total gallons of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials used each month, and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. These records shall be maintained for five years.</P>

              <P>(h) New affected sources must comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon startup or by December 7, 1995, whichever is later. New area sources that become major sources shall comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.</P>
              <P>(i) Reconstructed affected sources are subject to the requirements for new affected sources. The costs associated with the purchase and installation of air pollution control equipment (e.g., incinerators, carbon adsorbers, etc.) are not considered in determining whether the facility has been reconstructed, unless the control equipment is required as part of the process (e.g., product recovery). Additionally, the costs of retrofitting and replacement of equipment that is installed specifically to comply with this subpart are not considered reconstruction costs. For example, an affected source may convert to waterborne coatings to meet the requirements of this subpart. At most facilities, this conversion will require the replacement of existing storage tanks, mix equipment, and transfer lines. The cost of replacing the equipment is not considered in determining whether the facility has been reconstructed.</P>

              <P>(j) If the owner or operator, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.804, uses a control system as a means of limiting emissions, in response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this <PRTPAGE P="381"/>subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the respondent fails to meet its burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owner or operator must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) The excess emissions:</P>
              <P>(A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and</P>
              <P>(B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and</P>
              <P>(C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and</P>
              <P>(D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and</P>
              <P>(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and</P>
              <P>(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and</P>
              <P>(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</P>
              <P>(viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) Each new and existing facility that is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP), as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, at which publication rotogravure, product and packaging rotogravure, or wide-web flexographic printing presses are operated, and</P>
              <P>(2) Each new and existing facility at which publication rotogravure, product and packaging rotogravure, or wide-web flexographic printing presses are operated for which the owner or operator chooses to commit to and meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section for purposes of establishing the facility to be an area source of HAP with respect to this subpart. A facility which establishes area source status through some other mechanism, as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, is not subject to the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) Use less than 9.1 Mg (10 tons) per each rolling 12-month period of each HAP at the facility, including materials used for source categories or purposes other than printing and publishing, and</P>

              <P>(ii) Use less than 22.7 Mg (25 tons) per each rolling 12-month period of any <PRTPAGE P="411"/>combination of HAP at the facility, including materials used for source categories or purposes other than printing and publishing.</P>
              <P>(3) Each facility for which the owner or operator chooses to commit to and meets the criteria stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be considered an area source, and is subject only to the provisions of §§ 63.829(d) and 63.830(b)(1) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) Each facility for which the owner or operator commits to the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may exclude material used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining electric, propane, gasoline and diesel powered motor vehicles operated by the facility, and the use of HAP contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion).</P>
              <P>(5) Each facility for which the owner or operator commits to the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to become an area source, but subsequently exceeds either of the thresholds in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for any rolling 12-month period (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep its potential to emit HAP below major source levels), shall be considered in violation of its commitment for that 12-month period and shall be considered a major source of HAP beginning the first month after the end of the 12-month period in which either of the HAP-use thresholds was exceeded. As a major source of HAP, each such facility would be subject to the provisions of this subpart as noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and would no longer be eligible to use the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, even if in subsequent 12-month periods the facility uses less HAP than the thresholds in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section who chooses to no longer be subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall notify the Administrator of such change. If, by no longer being subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the facility at which the affected source is located becomes a major source:</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator of an existing source must continue to comply with the HAP usage provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the source is in compliance with all relevant requirements for existing affected sources under this subpart;</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator of a new source must continue to comply with the HAP usage provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the source is in compliance with all relevant requirements for new affected sources under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(7) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a facility from establishing area source status by limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart does not apply to research or laboratory equipment.</P>
              <P>(c) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>

              <P>(i) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; <PRTPAGE P="412"/>and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;</P>
              <P>(iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;</P>
              <P>(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;</P>
              <P>(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;</P>
              <P>(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation, if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;</P>
              <P>(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;</P>
              <P>(viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(ix) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.</P>

              <P>(a) Each owner or operator of any publication rotogravure printing affected source that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with these requirements on and after the compliance dates as specified in § 63.826 of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) Each publication rotogravure affected source shall limit emissions of organic HAP to no more than eight percent of the total volatile matter used each month. The emission limitation may be achieved by overall control of at least 92 percent of organic HAP used, by substitution of non-HAP materials for organic HAP, or by a combination of capture and control technologies and substitution of materials. To demonstrate compliance, each <PRTPAGE P="419"/>owner or operator shall follow the procedure in paragraph (b)(1) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by a solvent recovery device, the procedure in paragraph (b)(2) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by an oxidizer, and the procedure in paragraph (b)(3) of this section when no control device is used.</P>
              <P>(1) Each owner or operator using a solvent recovery device to control emissions shall demonstrate compliance by showing that the HAP emission limitation is achieved by following the procedures in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Perform a liquid-liquid material balance for each month as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Measure the mass of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by the affected source during the month.</P>
              <P>(B) Determine the organic HAP content of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent and other material used by the affected source during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(C) Determine the volatile matter content, including water, of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by the affected source during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(c)(1).</P>

              <FP>For the purposes of this calculation, the mass fraction of organic HAP present in the recovered volatile matter is assumed to be equal to the mass fraction of organic HAP present in the volatile matter used.</FP>

              <P>(ii) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:</P>

              <P>(A) Install continuous emission monitors to collect the data necessary to calculate the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream entering and the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device for each month such that the percent control efficiency (E) of the solvent recovery device can be calculated for the month. This requires continuous emission monitoring of the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device, the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device, and the volumetric gas flow rate through the solvent recovery device. A single continuous volumetric gas flow measurement should be sufficient for a solvent recovery device since the inlet and outlet volumetric gas flow rates for a solvent recovery device are essentially equal. Each month's individual inlet concentration values and corresponding individual gas flow rate values are multiplied and then summed to get the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device for the month. Each month's individual outlet <PRTPAGE P="420"/>concentration values and corresponding individual gas flow rate values are multiplied and then summed to get the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device for the month.</P>
              <P>(B) Determine the percent capture efficiency (F) of the capture system according to § 63.827(e).</P>

              <P>(E) The affected source is in compliance with the requirement for the month if R<E T="52">e</E> is at least 92 percent, and the capture device is operated at an average value greater than, or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5) for each three-hour period.</P>
              <P>(2) Each owner or operator using an oxidizer to control emissions shall demonstrate compliance by showing that the HAP emission limitation is achieved by following the procedure in either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Demonstrate initial compliance through performance tests and continuing compliance through continuous monitoring as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Determine the oxidizer destruction efficiency (E) using the procedure in § 63.827(d).</P>

Demonstration of continuing compliance is achieved by continuous monitoring of an appropriate oxidizer operating parameter in accordance with § 63.828(a)(4), and by continuous monitoring of an appropriate capture system monitoring parameter in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5). The affected source is in continuing compliance if the capture device is operated at an average value greater than or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5), and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) if an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer is used, the average combustion temperature for all three-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average combustion temperature established under § 63.827(d), or</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart KK of Part 63—Data Quality Objective and Lower Confidence Limit Approaches for Alternative Capture Efficiency Protocols and Test Methods</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Introduction</HD>
              <P>1.1 Alternative capture efficiency (CE) protocols and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality objective (DQO) approach or the lower confidence limit (LCL) approach are acceptable under § 63.827(f). The general criteria for alternative CE protocols and test methods to qualify under either the DQO or LCL approach are described in section 2. The DQO approach and criteria specific to the DQO approach are described in section 3. The LCL approach and criteria specific to the LCL approach are described in section 4. The recommended reporting for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in section 5. The recommended recordkeeping for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in section 6.</P>
              <P>1.2 Although the Procedures L, G.1, G.2, F.1, and F.2 in § 52.741 of part 52 were developed for TTE and BE testing, the same procedures can also be used in an alternative CE protocol. For example, a traditional liquid/gas mass balance CE protocol could employ Procedure L to measure liquid VOC input and Procedure G.1 to measure captured VOC.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. General Criteria for DQO and LCL Approaches</HD>

              <P>2.1 The following general criteria must be met for an alternative capture efficiency protocol and test methods to qualify under the DQO or LCL approach.<PRTPAGE P="442"/>
              </P>
              <P>2.2 An alternative CE protocol must consist of at least three valid test runs. Each test run must be at least 20 minutes long. No test run can be longer than 24 hours.</P>
              <P>2.3 All test runs must be separate and independent. For example, liquid VOC input and output must be determined independently for each run. The final liquid VOC sample from one run cannot be the initial sample for another run. In addition, liquid input for an entire day cannot be apportioned among test runs based on production.</P>
              <P>2.4 Composite liquid samples cannot be used to obtain an “average composition” for a test run. For example, separate initial and final coating samples must be taken and analyzed for each run; initial and final samples cannot be combined prior to analysis to derive an “average composition” for the test run.</P>
              <P>2.5 All individual test runs that result in a CE of greater than 105 percent are invalid and must be discarded.</P>
              <P>2.6 If the source can demonstrate to the regulatory agency that a test run should not be considered due to an identified testing or analysis error such as spillage of part of the sample during shipping or an upset or improper operating conditions that is not considered part of normal operation then the test result for that individual test run may be discarded. This limited exception allows sources to discard as “outliers” certain individual test runs without replacing them with a valid test run as long as the facility has at least three valid test runs to use when calculating its DQO or LCL. This exception is limited solely to test runs involving the types of errors identified above.</P>
              <P>2.7 All valid test runs that are conducted must be included in the average CE determination. The individual test run CE results and average CE results cannot be truncated (i.e., 105 percent cannot be reported as 100 + percent) for purposes of meeting general or specific criteria for either the DQO or the LCL. If the DQO is satisfied and the average CE is greater than 100, then 100 percent CE must be considered the result of the test.</P>
              <P>2.8 Alternative test methods for measuring VOC concentration must include a three-point calibration of the gas analysis instrument in the expected concentration range.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Data Quality Objective Approach</HD>
              <P>3.1 The purpose of the DQO is to allow sources to use alternative CE protocols and test methods while ensuring reasonable precision consistent with pertinent requirements of the Clean Air Act. In addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific DQO criterion is that the width of the two-sided 95 percent confidence interval of the mean measured value must be less than or equal to 10 percent of the mean measured value (see Figure 1). This ensures that 95 percent of the time, when the DQO is met, the actual CE value will be ±5 percent of the mean measured value (assuming that the test protocol is unbiased).</P>

              <P>3.10 Based on these results, the specific DQO criterion is satisfied. Since all of the general criteria were also satisfied, the average CE from the nine test runs can be used to determine compliance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Lower Confidence Limit Approach</HD>
              <P>4.1 The purpose of the LCL approach is to provide sources, that may be performing much better than their applicable regulatory requirement, a screening option by which they can demonstrate compliance. The approach uses less precise methods and avoids additional test runs which might otherwise be needed to meet the specific DQO criterion while still being assured of correctly demonstrating compliance. It is designed to reduce “false positive” or so called “Type II errors” which may erroneously indicate compliance where more variable test methods are employed. Because it encourages CE performance greater than that required in exchange for reduced compliance demonstration burden, the sources that successfully use the LCL approach could produce emission reductions beyond allowable emissions. Thus, it could provide additional benefits to the environment as well.</P>
              <P>4.2 The LCL approach compares the 80 percent (two-sided) LCL for the mean measured CE value to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. In addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific LCL criteria are that either the LCL be greater than or equal to the applicable CE regulatory requirement or that the specific DQO criterion is met. A more detailed description of the LCL approach follows:</P>
              <P>4.3 A source conducts an initial series of at least three runs. The owner or operator may choose to conduct additional test runs during the initial test if desired.</P>
              <P>4.4 If all of the general criteria are met and the specific DQO criterion is met, then the average CE value is used to determine compliance.</P>
              <P>4.5 If the data meet all of the general criteria, but do not meet the specific DQO criterion; and the average CE, using all valid test runs, is above 100 percent then the test sequence cannot be used to calculate the LCL. At this point the facility has the option of (a) conducting more test runs in hopes of meeting the DQO or of bringing the average CE for all test runs below 100 percent so the LCL can be used or (b) discarding all previous test data and retesting.</P>
              <P>4.6 The purpose of the requirement in Section 4.5 is to protect against protocols and test methods which may be inherently biased high. This is important because it is impossible to have an actual CE greater than 100 percent and the LCL approach only looks at the lower end variability of the test results. This is different from the DQO which allows average CE values up to 105 percent because the DQO sets both upper and lower limits on test variability.</P>
              <P>4.7 If at any point during testing the results meet the DQO, the average CE can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulatory requirement. Similarly, if the average CE is below 100 percent then the LCL can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulatory requirement without regard to the DQO.</P>
              <P>4.8 The LCL is calculated at an 80 percent (two-sided) confidence level as follows using Equation 11:</P>

                <MID>ER24MY06.006</MID>
              </MATH>
              <FP>Where:</FP>
              
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">LC<E T="52">1</E> = LCL at an 80-percent (two-sided) confidence level.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">n = Number of valid test runs.</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">x<E T="52">avg</E> = Average measured CE value (calculated from all valid test runs).</FP>
              
              <P>4.9 The resulting LC<E T="52">1</E> is compared to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. If LC<E T="52">1</E> exceeds (i.e., is higher than) the applicable regulatory requirement, then a facility is in initial compliance. However, if the LC<E T="52">1</E> is below the CE requirement, then the facility must conduct additional test runs. After this point the test results will be evaluated not only looking at the LCL, but also the DQO of ±5 percent of the mean at a 95 percent confidence level. If the test results with the additional test runs meet the DQO before the LCL exceeds the applicable CE regulatory requirement, then the average CE value will be compared to the applicable CE regulatory requirement for determination of compliance.<PRTPAGE P="445"/>
              </P>

              <P>4.10 If there is no specific CE requirement in the applicable regulation, then the applicable CE regulatory requirement is determined based on the applicable regulation and an acceptable destruction efficiency test. If the applicable regulation requires daily compliance and the latest CE compliance demonstration was made using the LCL approach, then the calculated LC<E T="52">1</E> will be the highest CE value which a facility is allowed to claim until another CE demonstration test is conducted. This last requirement is necessary to assure both sufficiently reliable test results in all circumstances and the potential environmental benefits referenced above.</P>

              <P>(ii) Correlate the results of the two methods (the applicable test method results and the alternative monitoring <PRTPAGE P="463"/>method results) and establish an emission limit for the alternative monitoring system that corresponds to the applicable emission limit.</P>
              <P>(5) The owner or operator shall submit the results required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and all supporting documentation to the applicable regulatory authority for review and approval.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Electronic reporting.</E> (1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test following the procedure specified in either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) For data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site (<E T="03">https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/electronic-reporting-tool-ert</E>) at the time of the test, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). (CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (<E T="03">https://cdx.epa.gov/</E>).) Performance test data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file format consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site. If the owner or operator claims that some of the performance test information being submitted is confidential business information (CBI), the owner or operator must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (d)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(ii) For data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site at the time of the test, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13 unless the Administrator agrees to or specifies an alternative reporting method.</P>

              <P>(2) The owner or operator must submit the notifications required in § 63.9(b) and § 63.9(h) (including any information specified in § 63.867(b)) and semiannual reports to the EPA via the CEDRI. (CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's CDX (<E T="03">https://cdx.epa.gov</E>).) You must upload an electronic copy of each notification in CEDRI beginning with any notification specified in this paragraph that is required after October 11, 2019. The owner or operator must use the appropriate electronic report in CEDRI for this subpart listed on the CEDRI Web site (<E T="03">https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/compliance-and-emissions-data-reporting-interface-cedri</E>) for semiannual reports. If the reporting form specific to this subpart is not available in CEDRI at the time that the report is due, you must submit the report to the Administrator at all the appropriate addresses listed in § 63.13. Once the form has been available in CEDRI for 1 <PRTPAGE P="494"/>year, you must begin submitting all subsequent reports via CEDRI. The reports must be submitted by the deadlines specified in this subpart, regardless of the method in which the reports are submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(4) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards—Tank fixed roof.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and controlling air emissions from a tank using a fixed roof. This section does not apply to a fixed-roof tank that is also equipped with an internal floating roof.</P>
              <P>(b) The tank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications:</P>
              <P>(1) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid in the tank. The fixed roof may be a separate cover installed on the tank (e.g., a removable cover mounted on an open-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural design (e.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a hatch).</P>
              <P>(2) The fixed roof shall be installed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof edge and the tank wall.</P>
              <P>(3) Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the fixed roof, shall be either:</P>
              <P>(i) equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the opening and the closure device; or</P>
              <P>(ii) connected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device. The control device shall remove or destroy organics in the vent stream, and shall be operating whenever regulated material is managed in the tank.</P>
              <P>(4) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the liquid or its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the tank on which the fixed roof is installed.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever a regulated-material is in the tank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed position except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the following times:</P>

              <P>(i) To provide access to the tank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the tank, or when a worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the tank.<PRTPAGE P="506"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of tank.</P>
              <P>(2) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with the tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</P>
              <P>(3) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.901 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator shall inspect the air emission control equipment in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.906(a) of this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test methods and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.</P>
              <P>(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.</P>
              <P>(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.</P>
              <P>(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</P>
              <P>(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>

              <P>(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the <PRTPAGE P="507"/>configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Inspection and monitoring requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Owners and operators that use a tank equipped with a fixed roof in accordance with the provisions of § 63.902 of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the tank wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the fixed roof. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.907 (a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall repair all detected defects as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall make first efforts at repair of the defect no later than 5 calendar days after detection and repair shall be completed as soon as possible but no later than 45 calendar days after detection except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary removal from service of the tank and no alternative tank capacity is available at the site to accept the regulated material normally managed in the tank. In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time alternative tank capacity becomes available and the tank can be emptied or temporarily removed from <PRTPAGE P="508"/>service, as necessary to complete the repair.</P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.907(b) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative inspection and monitoring interval.</E> Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a fixed roof in accordance with this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as “unsafe to inspect and monitor.” The documentation must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.</P>

              <P>(a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and required to control air emissions from containers using Container Level 1 controls.</P>
              <P>(b) A container using Container Level 1 controls is one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A container that meets the applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous materials for transportation as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A container equipped with a cover and closure devices that form a continuous barrier over the container openings such that when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position there are no visible holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container. The cover may be a separate cover installed on the container (e.g., a lid on a drum, a suitably secured tarp on a roll-off box) or may be an integral part of the container structural design (e.g., a bulk cargo container equipped with a screw-type cap).</P>
              <P>(3) An open-top container in which an organic vapor-suppressing barrier is placed on or over the regulated-material in the container such that no regulated-material is exposed to the atmosphere. One example of such a barrier is application of a suitable organic-vapor suppressing foam.</P>
              <P>(c) A container used to meet the requirements of either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section shall be equipped with covers and closure devices, as applicable to the container, that are composed of suitable materials to minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere and to maintain the equipment integrity for as long as it is in service. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the cover and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of contact with the material or its vapor managed in the container; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for container on which the cover is installed.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever a regulated-material is in a container using Container Level 1 controls, the owner or operator shall install all covers and closure devices for the container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed position except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of adding material to the container as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case when the container is filled to the intended final level in one continuous operation, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material intermittently are added to the container over a period of time, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon either: the container being filled to the intended final level; the completion of a batch loading after which no additional material will be added to the container within 15 minutes; the person performing the loading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container; or the shutdown of the process generating the material being added to the container, whichever condition occurs first.</P>
              <P>(2) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of removing material from the container as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart may be open to the atmosphere at any time (e.g., covers and closure devices are not required to be secured in the closed position on an empty container).</P>

              <P>(ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are removed from the container but the container does not meet the conditions to be an empty container as defined in <PRTPAGE P="511"/>§ 63.921 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal after which no additional material will be removed from the container within 15 minutes, or the person performing the unloading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, whichever condition occurs first.</P>
              <P>(3) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed when access inside the container is needed to perform routine activities other than transfer of regulated-material. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to measure the depth of or sample the material in the container, or when a worker needs to open a manhole hatch to access equipment inside the container. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable to the container.</P>
              <P>(4) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the container internal pressure in accordance with the container design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the container internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on container manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the container as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</P>
              <P>(5) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator shall inspect containers using Container Level 1 controls in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.926(a) of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) Procedures for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.</P>
              <P>(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.</P>
              <P>(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.</P>
              <P>(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</P>
              <P>(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable <PRTPAGE P="515"/>value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(b) Procedure for determining a container to be vapor-tight for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The test shall be performed in accordance with Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) A pressure measurement device shall be used that has a precision of ±2.5 mm water and that is capable of measuring above the pressure at which the container is to be tested for vapor tightness.</P>
              <P>(3) If the test results determined by Method 27 indicate that the container sustains a pressure change less than or equal to 750 Pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 Pascals, then the container is determined to be vapor-tight.</P>

              <P>(1) In the case when a regulated-material already is in the container at the time the owner or operator first accepts possession of the container at the facility site and the container is not emptied (i.e., does not meet the conditions for an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart) within 24 hours after the container has been accepted at the facility site, the container and its cover and closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position. This inspection of the container must be conducted on or before the date that the container is accepted at the facility (i.e., the date that the container becomes subject to the standards under this subpart). For the purpose of this requirement, the date of acceptance is the date of signature of the facility owner or operator on the manifest or shipping papers accompanying the container. If a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) In the case when a container filled or partially filled with regulated-material remains unopened at the facility site for a period of 1 year or more, the container and its cover and closure devices shall be visually inspected by the owner or operator initially and thereafter, at least once every calendar year, to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position. If a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="516"/>

              <SUBJECT>Test methods and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.</P>
              <P>(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.</P>
              <P>(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.</P>
              <P>(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</P>
              <P>(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>

              <P>(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument <PRTPAGE P="521"/>probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>

              <P>(F) To measure inlet and outlet concentrations of total organic regulated material, use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or ASTM D6420-99, under the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>) of this section. In conducting the performance test, collect and analyze samples as specified in Method 18 or ASTM D6420-99. You must collect samples simultaneously at the inlet and outlet of the control device. If the performance test is for a combustion control device, you must first determine which regulated material compounds are present in the inlet gas stream (i.e., uncontrolled emissions) using process knowledge or the screening procedure described in Method 18. Quantify the emissions for the regulated material compounds present in the inlet gas stream for both the inlet and outlet gas streams for the combustion device.</P>
              <P>(G) To determine inlet and outlet concentrations of TOC, use Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Measure the total gaseous non-methane organic (TGNMO) concentration of the inlet and outlet vent streams using the procedures of Method 25. Use the TGNMO concentration in Equations 4 and 5 of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(H) Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used instead of Method 25 to measure inlet and outlet concentrations of TOC if the condition in either paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(H)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section is met.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control would result in exhaust TGNMO concentrations of 50 parts per million by volume or less.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Because of the high efficiency of the control device, the anticipated TGNMO concentration of the control device exhaust is 50 parts per million by volume or less, regardless of the inlet concentration.</P>

              <P>(I) If the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains formaldehyde, you must conduct emissions testing according to paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(I)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If you elect to comply with a percent reduction requirement and formaldehyde is the principal regulated material compound (i.e., greater than 50 percent of the regulated material compounds in the stream by volume), you must use Method 316 or 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, to measure formaldehyde at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Use the percent reduction in formaldehyde as a surrogate for the percent reduction in total regulated material emissions.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If you elect to comply with an outlet total organic regulated material concentration or TOC concentration limit, and the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains greater than 10 percent (by volume) formaldehyde, you must use Method 316 or 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, to separately determine the formaldehyde concentration. Calculate the total organic regulated material concentration or TOC concentration by totaling the formaldehyde emissions measured using Method 316 or 320 and the other regulated material compound emissions measured using Method 18 or 25/25A.</P>

              <P>(3) An owner or operator using a halogen scrubber or other halogen reduction device to control process vent and transfer rack halogenated vent <PRTPAGE P="552"/>streams in compliance with a referencing subpart, who is required to conduct a performance test to determine compliance with a control efficiency or emission limit for hydrogen halides and halogens, shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For an owner or operator determining compliance with the percent reduction of total hydrogen halides and halogens, sampling sites shall be located at the inlet and outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device used to reduce halogen emissions. For an owner or operator determining compliance with a kilogram per hour outlet emission limit for total hydrogen halides and halogens, the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, Method 26 or Method 26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the concentration, in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter, of total hydrogen halides and halogens that may be present in the vent stream. The mass emissions of each hydrogen halide and halogen compound shall be calculated from the measured concentrations and the gas stream flow rate.</P>
              <P>(iii) To determine compliance with the percent removal efficiency, the mass emissions for any hydrogen halides and halogens present at the inlet of the halogen reduction device shall be summed together. The mass emissions of the compounds present at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device shall be summed together. Percent reduction shall be determined by comparison of the summed inlet and outlet measurements.</P>
              <P>(iv) To demonstrate compliance with a kilogram per hour outlet emission limit, the test results must show that the mass emission rate of total hydrogen halides and halogens measured at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device is below the kilogram per hour outlet emission limit specified in a referencing subpart.</P>

The current description shall be retained on-site at all times or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. <PRTPAGE P="557"/>The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after being superseded. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring were required and/or approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(A) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i). The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.</P>

The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section for the duration specified in a referencing subpart. For any week, if compliance with paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) For the purposes of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a) and maintains the records specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) An excused excursion, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii), does not count toward the number of excursions for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) One excused excursion for each control device or recovery device for each semiannual period is allowed. If a source has developed a startup, shutdown and malfunction plan, and a monitored parameter is outside its established range or monitoring data are not collected during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)) or during periods of nonoperation of the process unit or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which monitoring applies), then the excursion is not a violation and, in cases where continuous monitoring is required, the excursion does not count as the excused excursion for determining compliance.</P>

The leak identification on a connector in gas/vapor or light liquid service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in § 63.1008(b) and no leak has been detected during that monitoring.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other equipment.</E> The identification that has been placed, pursuant to § 63.1004(e), on equipment determined to have a leak, except for a valve in gas/vapor or light liquid service, may be removed after it is repaired.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Delay of repair.</E> Delay of repair can be used as specified in any of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the facts that explain any delay of repairs and, where appropriate, why the repair was technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown.</P>
              <P>(1) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a process unit or affected facility shutdown within 15 days after a leak is detected. Repair of this equipment shall occur as soon as practical, but not later than by the end of the next process unit or affected facility shutdown, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in regulated material service.</P>

              <P>(i) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and</P>
              <P>(ii) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed, or recovered in a control or recovery device, or routed to a fuel gas system or process complying with § 63.1015 or § 63.1002(b) of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Delay of repair for pumps is allowed if the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) are met.</P>
              <P>(i) Repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a new system that the owner or operator has determined will provide better performance or one of the specifications of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(A) A dual mechanical seal system that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(1) will be installed,</P>
              <P>(B) A pump that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(2) will be installed; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Repair is to be completed as soon as practical, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.</P>

              <P>(5) Delay of repair beyond a process unit or affected facility shutdown will be allowed for a valve if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit or affected facility shutdown, and valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the second process unit or affected facility shutdown will not be allowed unless the third process unit or affected facility shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the <PRTPAGE P="575"/>first process unit or affected facility shutdown.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unsafe-to-repair connectors.</E> Any connector that is designated, as described in § 63.1003(d), as an unsafe-to-repair connector is exempt from the requirements of § 63.1008(c), and paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Leak repair records.</E> For each leak detected, the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section shall be recorded and maintained pursuant to the referencing subpart.</P>

              <P>(i) The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. The written procedures may be included as part of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, as required by the referencing subpart for the source, or may be part of a separate document that is maintained at the plant site. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.</P>
              <P>(ii) If delay of repair was caused by depletion of stocked parts, there must be documentation that the spare parts were sufficiently stocked on site before depletion and the reason for depletion.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Monitoring method.</E> The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in § 63.1004(b) and (c).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Instrument reading that defines a leak.</E> The instrument reading that defines a leak is 10,000 parts per million or greater.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Monitoring period.</E> (i) Each valve shall be monitored monthly to detect leaks, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(4) of this section. An owner or operator may otherwise elect to comply with one of the alternative standards in paragraphs (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) Any valve for which a leak is not detected for 2 successive months may be monitored the same month (first, second, or third month) of every quarter, beginning with the next quarter, until a leak is detected. The first quarterly monitoring shall occur less than 3 months following the last monthly monitoring.</P>
              <P>(B) If a leak is detected, the valve shall be monitored monthly until a leak is not detected for 2 successive months.</P>

              <P>(i) A compliance demonstration for each affected facility or process unit or affected facility complying with this alternative shall be conducted initially upon designation, annually, and at other times requested by the Administrator. For each such demonstration, all valves in gas and vapor and light liquid service within the affected facility or process unit shall be monitored within 1 week by the methods specified in § 63.1004(b). If an instrument reading exceeds the equipment leak level specified in the referencing subpart, a leak is detected. The leak percentage shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator decides no longer to comply with this alternative, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator in writing that the work practice standard described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will be followed.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Skip period alternatives.</E> An owner or operator may elect to comply with one of the alternative work practices specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) or (b)(6)(ii) of this section.

Before using either skip period alternative, the owner or operator shall initially comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart that meets the criteria of either § 63.1004(b)(1) through (b)(5), or § 63.1004(b)(6), may be used to initially qualify for skip period alternatives.</P>
              <P>(i) After 2 consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percent of valves leaking equal to or less than 2.0 as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator may begin to monitor for leaks once every 6 months.</P>
              <P>(ii) After 5 consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percent of valves leaking equal to or less than 2.0 as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator may begin to monitor for leaks once every year.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the percent of valves leaking is greater than 2.0, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, but can elect to comply with paragraph (b)(6) of this section if future percent of valves leaking is again equal to or less than 2.0.</P>
              <P>(iv) The owner or operator shall keep a record of the monitoring schedule and the percent of valves found leaking during each monitoring period.</P>

Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the same basis and this shall be the basis used for comparison with the subgrouping criteria specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The percent of valves leaking shall be determined by dividing the sum of valves found leaking during current monitoring and valves for which repair has been delayed by the total number of valves subject to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Leak repair.</E> (1) If a leak is determined pursuant to paragraph (b), (e)(1), or (e)(2) of this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the procedures in § 63.1005, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(2) After a leak determined pursuant to paragraph (b) or (e)(2) of this section has been repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least once within the first 3 months after its repair. The monitoring required by this paragraph <PRTPAGE P="577"/>is in addition to the monitoring required to satisfy the definition of repair.</P>
              <P>(i) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in § 63.1004(b) and (c), as appropriate, to determine whether the valve has resumed leaking.</P>
              <P>(ii) Periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, if the timing of the monitoring period coincides with the time specified in this paragraph. Alternatively, other monitoring may be performed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, regardless of whether the timing of the monitoring period for periodic monitoring coincides with the time specified in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a leak is detected by monitoring that is conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall follow the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, to determine whether that valve must be counted as a leaking valve for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) If the owner or operator elected to use periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve.</P>
              <P>(B) If the owner or operator elected to use other monitoring, prior to the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section, to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.</P>

              <P>(A) Tests the valve for operation with emissions less than 500 parts per million above background as determined by the method specified in § 63.1004(c) initially upon designation, annually, and at other times requested by the Administrator, and</P>
              <P>(B) Records the dates of each compliance demonstration, the background level measured during each compliance test, and the maximum instrument reading measured at the equipment during each compliance test.</P>
              <P>(ii) A valve may not be designated or operated for no detectable emissions, as described in § 63.1003(e), if the valve has an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million above background.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test methods and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.</P>
              <P>(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.</P>
              <P>(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.</P>
              <P>(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and</P>
              <P>(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>

              <P>(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of <PRTPAGE P="625"/>the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(b) Procedure for performing floating roof seal gap measurements for the purpose of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall determine the total surface area of gaps in the primary seal and in the secondary seal individually.</P>
              <P>(2) The seal gap measurements shall be performed at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof supports.</P>
              <P>(3) Seal gaps, if any, shall be measured around the entire perimeter of the floating roof in each place where 0.32-centimeter (cm) (<FR>1/8</FR> inch) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the separator and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.</P>
              <P>(4) For a seal gap measured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the gap surface area shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the separator wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.</P>
              <P>(5) The total gap area shall be calculated by adding the gap surface areas determined for each identified gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually, and then dividing the sum for each seal type by the nominal perimeter of the separator basin. These total gap areas for the primary seal and secondary seal then are compared to the respective standards for the seal type as specified in § 63.1043(b)(2) of this subpart.</P>

Any of the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section constitutes inspection failure. Identification of holes or tears in the rim seal is required only for the seal that is visible from the top of the storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(3) Seal gap inspections for EFR's shall determine the presence and size of gaps between the rim seals and the wall of the storage vessel by the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Any exceedance of the gap requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(3)(iii) of this section constitutes inspection failure.</P>
              <P>(i) Rim seals shall be measured for gaps at one or more levels while the EFR is floating, as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) through (d)(3)(i)(F) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The inspector shall hold a 0.32 centimeter (<FR>1/8</FR> inch) diameter probe vertically against the inside of the storage vessel wall, just above the rim seal, and attempt to slide the probe down between the seal and the vessel wall. Each location where the probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the vessel wall constitutes a gap.</P>

              <P>(B) The length of each gap shall be determined by inserting the probe into the gap (vertically) and sliding the probe along the vessel wall in each direction as far as it will travel freely without binding between the seal and the vessel wall. The circumferential length along which the probe can move freely is the gap length.<PRTPAGE P="633"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) The maximum width of each gap shall be determined by inserting probes of various diameters between the seal and the vessel wall. The smallest probe diameter should be 0.32 centimeter, and larger probes should have diameters in increments of 0.32 centimeter. The diameter of the largest probe that can be inserted freely anywhere along the length of the gap is the maximum gap width.</P>
              <P>(D) The average width of each gap shall be determined by averaging the minimum gap width (0.32 centimeter) and the maximum gap width.</P>
              <P>(E) The area of a gap is the product of the gap length and average gap width.</P>
              <P>(F) The ratio of accumulated area of rim seal gaps to storage vessel diameter shall be determined by adding the area of each gap, and dividing the sum by the nominal diameter of the storage vessel. This ratio shall be determined separately for primary and secondary rim seals.</P>
              <P>(ii) The ratio of seal gap area to vessel diameter for the primary seal shall not exceed 212 square centimeters per meter of vessel diameter (10 square inches per foot of vessel diameter), and the maximum gap width shall not exceed 3.81 centimeters (1.5 inches).</P>
              <P>(iii) The ratio of seal gap area to vessel diameter for the secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 square centimeters per meter (1 square inch per foot), and the maximum gap width shall not exceed 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches), except when the secondary seal must be pulled back or removed to inspect the primary seal.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Repair requirements.</E> Conditions causing inspection failures under paragraph (d) of this section shall be repaired as specified in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) If the inspection is performed while the storage vessel is not storing liquid, repairs shall be completed before the refilling of the storage vessel with liquid.</P>
              <P>(2) If the inspection is performed while the storage vessel is storing liquid, repairs shall be completed or the vessel removed from service within 45 days. If a repair cannot be completed and the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, the owner or operator may use up to 2 extensions of up to 30 additional days each. Documentation of a decision to use an extension shall include a description of the failure, shall document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable, and shall specify a schedule of actions that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be completely emptied as soon as practical.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How must I monitor for leaks to cooling water?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must monitor for leaks to cooling water by monitoring each heat exchange system according to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, monitoring each heat exchanger according to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, or monitoring a surrogate parameter according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If you elect to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may use alternatives in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section for determining the mean entrance concentration.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Heat exchange system.</E> Monitor cooling water in each heat exchange system for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (either total or speciated) or other representative substances (e.g., total organic carbon or volatile organic compounds (VOC)) that indicate the presence of a leak according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You define the equipment that comprises each heat exchange system. For the purposes of implementing paragraph (a) of this section, a heat exchange system may consist of an entire heat exchange system or any combinations of heat exchangers such that, based on the rate of cooling water at the entrance and exit to each heat exchange system and the sensitivity of the test method being used, a leak of 3.06 kg/hr or greater of the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart would be detected. For example, if the test you decide to use has a sensitivity of 1 ppmv for total HAP, you must define the heat exchange system so that the cooling water flow rate is 51,031 liters per minute or less so that a leak of 3.06 kg/hr can be detected.</P>
                <P>(2) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Monitor heat exchange systems at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in either paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.</P>
                <P>(B) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Monitor weekly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.</P>

                <P>(B) If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of the repair, <PRTPAGE P="638"/>monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the heat exchange system cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. You may validate 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart according to the procedures in appendix D to this part. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(4) Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each entrance and exit.</P>
                <P>(5) Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations, correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 10 percent greater than the entrance mean of the HAP (total or speciated) in Table 1 to this subpart or other representative substance, and the leak is at least 3.06 kg/hr, you have detected a leak.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Individual heat exchangers.</E> Monitor the cooling water at the entrance and exit of each heat exchanger for the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart (either total or speciated) or other representative substances (e.g., total organic carbon or VOC) that indicate the presence of a leak in a heat exchanger according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Monitor each heat exchanger at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.</P>
                <P>(B) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Monitor weekly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.</P>
                <P>(B) If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136, as long as the method is sensitive to concentrations as low as 10 ppmv. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. Validation of 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart may be determined according to the provisions of appendix D to this part. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(3) Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each heat exchanger entrance and exit.</P>
                <P>(4) Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations, correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 1 ppmw or 10 percent greater than the entrance mean, whichever is greater, you have detected a leak.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Surrogate parameters.</E> You may elect to comply with the requirements of this section by monitoring using a surrogate indicator of leaks, provided that you comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity, or other representative indicators.</P>

                <P>(1) You shall prepare and implement a monitoring plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of process fluids into cooling waters. The plan shall require monitoring of one or more process parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. <PRTPAGE P="639"/>Monitoring that is already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably indicate the presence of a leak.</P>
                <P>(ii) The parameter level(s) or condition(s) that shall constitute a leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, you have detected a leak.</P>
                <P>(iii) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Monitor heat exchange systems at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.</P>

                <P>(A) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (c)(1)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(1) If no leaks are detected, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.</P>
                <P>(2) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.</P>

                <P>(iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) If a leak is identified by audio, visual, or olfactory inspection, a method listed in 40 CFR part 136, or any other means other than those described in the monitoring plan, and the method(s) specified in the plan could not detect the leak, you shall revise the plan and document the basis for the changes. You shall complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.</P>
                <P>(3) You shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is changed, you must retain the most recent superseded plan for at least 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Simplifying assumptions for entrance mean concentration.</E> If you are complying with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may elect to determine the entrance mean concentration as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Assume that the entrance mean concentration of the monitored substance is zero; or,</P>
                <P>(2) Determine the entrance mean concentration of a monitored substance at a sampling location anywhere upstream of the heat exchanger or heat exchange system, provided that there is not a reasonable opportunity for the concentration to change at the entrance to each heat exchanger or heat exchange system.</P>

                <P>(a) Repair the leak as soon as practical but not later than 45 calendar days after you received the results of monitoring tests that indicated a leak. You must repair the leak unless you demonstrate that the results are due to a condition other than a leak.</P>

                <P>(b) Once the leak has been repaired, use the monitoring requirements in § 63.1086 within 7 calendar days of the <PRTPAGE P="640"/>repair or startup, whichever is later, to confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired.</P>

                <P>You may delay the repair of heat exchange systems if the leaking equipment is isolated from the process. You may also delay repair if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, and you meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(a) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you are not required to have a special shutdown before that planned shutdown.</P>
                <P>(b) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you may delay repair if a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. You must document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. The documentation process must include the activities in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) State the reason(s) for delaying repair.</P>
                <P>(2) Specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.</P>
                <P>(3) Calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) in the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flow rate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger and by the expected duration of the delay.</P>
                <P>(4) Determine emissions of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.</P>
                <P>(c) If repair is delayed because the necessary equipment, parts or personnel are not available, you may delay repair a maximum of 120 calendar days. You must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts or personnel were not available.</P>

                <P>The major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the requirements for ethylene production sources are listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(a) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to all ethylene production sources that are part of a major source. The requirements do not include a provision to exempt sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) from control requirements.</P>
                <P>(b) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to continuous butadiene waste streams which do not contain benzene quantities that would make them subject to the management and treatment requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF.</P>
                <P>(c) The requirements for ethylene production sources do not include the compliance options at 40 CFR 61.342(c)(3)(ii), (d) and (e) for sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 Mg/yr.</P>
                <P>(d) If you transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements in § 63.1096 rather than 40 CFR 61.342(f).</P>

                <P>(b) You may not transfer the waste stream unless the transferee has submitted to the Administrator a written certification that the transferee will <PRTPAGE P="643"/>manage and treat any waste stream received from a source subject to the requirements of this subpart in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) By providing this written certification to the Administrator, the certifying entity accepts responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions in this subpart with respect to any shipment of waste covered by the written certification. Failure to abide by any of those provisions with respect to such shipments may result in enforcement action by EPA against the certifying entity in accordance with the enforcement provisions applicable to violations of those provisions by owners or operators of sources.</P>
                <P>(d) The certifying entity may revoke the written certification by sending a written statement to the Administrator and you. The notice of revocation must provide at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions of this subpart. Upon expiration of the notice period, you may not transfer the waste stream to that off-site treatment operation. Written certifications and revocation statements to the Administrator from the transferees of waste shall be signed by the responsible official of the certifying entity, provide the name and address of the certifying entity, and be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional Office at the addresses listed in 40 CFR 63.13. Such written certifications are not transferable by the treater to other off-site waste treatment operators.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Research and development facilities.</E> The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities, consistent with section 112(b)(7) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Primary product determination and applicability.</E> The primary product of a process unit shall be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraphs (d)(3), (4), and (5) of this section discuss compliance for those process units operated as flexible operation units.</P>
              <P>(1) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</P>
              <P>(2) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following the promulgation date for existing affected sources and for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources.</P>
              <P>(i) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for the greatest percentage of operating time over the five-year period, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest production on a mass basis over the five-year period shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.</P>
              <P>(3) Once the primary product of a process unit has been determined to be a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the standards for the primary product production process unit.</P>

              <P>(4) The determination of the primary product for a process unit, including the assessment of applicability of this subpart to process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units, shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4) when the primary product is determined to be a product produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart. The Notification of Compliance Status shall include the information specified in either paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section. If the primary product is determined to be something other than a product produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart, the owner or operator shall retain information, data, and analyses used to document the basis for the determination that the primary product is not produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="646"/>

              <P>(B) Information concerning operating time and/or production mass for each product that was used to make the determination of the primary product under paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) When a flexible operation unit that is subject to this subpart is producing a product other than a product subject to this subpart, or is producing a product subject to this subpart that is not the primary product, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (d)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section for each emission point.</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator shall control emissions during the production of all products in accordance with the requirements for the production of the primary product. As appropriate, the owner or operator shall demonstrate that the parameter monitoring level established for the primary product is also appropriate for those periods when products other than the primary product are being produced. Documentation of this demonstration shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator shall determine, for the production of each product, whether control is required in accordance with the applicable criteria for the primary product in § 63.1103. If control is required, the owner or operator shall establish separate parameter monitoring levels, as appropriate, for the production of each product. The parameter monitoring levels developed shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Storage vessel ownership determination.</E> To determine the process unit to which a storage vessel shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.</P>
              <P>(1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date of promulgation for an affected source under the generic MACT, that storage vessel shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.</P>
              <P>(3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit has the predominant use of the storage vessel.)</P>
              <P>(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if only one of those process units is subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.</P>
              <P>(5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are subject to standards under this subpart that have different primary products, then the owner or operator shall assign the storage vessel to any one of the process units sharing the storage vessel.</P>

              <P>(6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the date of promulgation of standards for an affected source under this subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected utilization for the 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use <PRTPAGE P="647"/>changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.</P>
              <P>(7) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) another process unit; ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit; or if the applicability of this subpart to a storage vessel has been determined according to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section and there is a significant change in the use of the storage vessel that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(8) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that includes one or more process units that place material into, or receive materials from, the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a tank farm, the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is only one process unit at a major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.</P>
              <P>(iii) If there are two or more process units at the major source that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Recovery operation equipment ownership determination.</E> To determine the process unit to which recovery equipment shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.</P>
              <P>(1) If recovery operation equipment is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date standards are promulgated for an affected source, that recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) If recovery operation equipment is used exclusively by a single process unit, the recovery operation shall belong to that process unit.</P>
              <P>(3) If recovery operation equipment is shared among process units, then the recovery operation equipment shall belong to that process unit that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operation equipment (i.e., that process unit has the predominant use of the recovery operation equipment).</P>
              <P>(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process units is a process unit subject to this subpart, the recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are process units that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the recovery operation equipment to any one of those process units.</P>

              <P>(6) If the predominant use of recovery operation equipment varies from year to year, then the predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this <PRTPAGE P="648"/>subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date for standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is the more representative of the expected operations for the recovery operations equipment, and based on the expected utilization for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. This determination shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.</P>
              <P>(7) If there is an unexpected change in the utilization of recovery operation equipment that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall redetermine to which process unit the recovery operation belongs by reperforming the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2) through (6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Overlap with other regulations.</E> Paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section specify the applicability of this subpart YY emission point requirements when other rules may apply. Where subpart YY of this part allows an owner or operator an option to comply with one or another regulation to comply with subpart YY of this part, an owner or operator must report which regulation they choose to comply with in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Process vents from continuous unit operations: applicability assessment procedures and methods.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The provisions of this section provide calculation and measurement methods for criteria that are required by § 63.1103 to be used to determine applicability of the control requirements for process vents from continuous unit operations. The owner or operator of a process vent is not required to determine the criteria specified for a process vent that is being controlled (including control by flare) in accordance with the applicable weight-percent, TOC concentration, or organic HAP concentration requirement in § 63.1103.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sampling sites.</E> For purposes of determining process vent applicability criteria, the sampling site shall be located as specified in (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling site location if TRE determination is required.</E> If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 includes a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, heating value, and TRE index value, shall be after the final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present, and prior to release to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sampling site location if TRE determination is not required.</E> If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 does not include a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, and any other specified parameter shall be at the exit from the unit operation before any control device.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Sampling site selection method.</E> Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process vents smaller than 0.10 meter (0.33 foot) in nominal inside diameter.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a combustion device.</E> An owner or operator using a scrubber to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion control device in compliance with <PRTPAGE P="681"/>§ 63.1103 (as appropriate) shall determine the halogen atom mass emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability assessment requirement.</E> The TOC or organic HAP concentrations, process vent volumetric flow rates, process vent heating values, process vent TOC or organic HAP emission rates, halogenated process vent determinations, process vent TRE index values, and engineering assessments for process vent control applicability assessment requirements are to be determined during maximum representative operating conditions for the process, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, operations during periods of malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test. For all other affected sources, operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> For a process vent stream that consists of at least one process vent from a batch unit operation manifolded with at least one process vent from a continuous unit operation, the TRE shall be calculated during periods when one or more batch emission episodes are occurring that result in the highest organic HAP emission rate (in the combined vent stream that is being routed to the recovery device) that is achievable during the 6-month period that begins 3 months before and ends 3 months after the TRE calculation, without causing any of the situations described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) to occur.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Equipment leaks.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP <PRTPAGE P="690"/>service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used.</P>
              <P>(b) An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.</P>
              <P>(c) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.</P>
              <P>(d) Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirements for pressure relief devices.</E> For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator of an acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected source or polycarbonate production affected source must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Operating requirements.</E> Except during a pressure release event, operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A.</P>

              <P>(B) Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and</P>

              <P>(C) Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the pressure relief <PRTPAGE P="691"/>device itself or may be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.</P>
              <P>(ii) If any pressure relief device in organic HAP service releases to atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, the owner or operator must calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each pressure release event and report this quantity as required in paragraph (g) of this section. Calculations may be based on data from the pressure relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter monitoring data and process knowledge.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Pressure relief devices routed to a control device, process, fuel gas system, or drain system.</E> If a pressure relief device in organic HAP service is designed and operated to route all HAP emissions from pressure releases through a closed vent system to a control device or to a process, fuel gas system, or drain system, the owner or operator is not required to comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), or (3) (if applicable) of this section for that pressure relief device. The fuel gas system or closed vent system and control device (if applicable) must meet the requirements of § 63.172 or § 63.1034, as applicable (except that the term “pressure relief devices” shall apply instead of the term “equipment leaks” in § 63.1034). The drain system (if applicable) must meet the requirements of § 63.136.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, for pressure relief devices in organic HAP service, keep records of the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section, as applicable.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 63.1108</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Compliance with standards and operation and maintenance requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (5) of this section apply to all affected sources except acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. The requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(3), (6), and (7) of this section apply to all affected sources.</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. However, if a startup, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart and any of the subparts that are referenced by this subpart during startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation.</P>
              <P>(2) If equipment leak requirements are referenced by this subpart for a subject source category, such requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, process unit shutdown (as defined in § 63.1101), or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.</P>
              <P>(3) For batch unit operations, shutdown does not include the normal periods between batch cycles; and startup does not include the recharging of batch unit operations, or the transitional conditions due to changes in product.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. Equipment leak requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">General duty.</E> At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, <PRTPAGE P="693"/>review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>
              <P>(5) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission standards of this subpart and the subparts referenced by this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (if applicable), and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if available. Compliance with an inadequate startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan developed pursuant to § 63.1111 is not a shield for failing to comply with good operation and maintenance requirements.</P>
              <P>(6) Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practical after their occurrence.</P>
              <P>(7) Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable, independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance assessment procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Parameter monitoring: compliance with operating conditions.</E> Compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices may be determined by, but is not limited to, the parameter monitoring data for emission points that are required to perform continuous monitoring. For each excursion, except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(i) An excursion that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not a violation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Excused excursions are not allowed for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources or polycarbonate production affected sources. For all other affected sources, an excused excursion, as described in § 63.998(b)(6)(ii), is not a violation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Parameter monitoring: Excursions.</E> An excursion is not a violation in cases where continuous monitoring is required and the excursion does not count toward the number of excused excursions (as described in § 63.998(b)(6)(ii)), if the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are met, except that the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section do not apply for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)), or</P>
              <P>(ii) During periods of non-operation of the affected source or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance procedures.</E> Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator. This information may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan under § 63.1111), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source, and alternatives approved as specified in § 63.1113.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicability and compliance assessment procedures.</E> Applicability and compliance with standards shall be governed by, in part, but not limited to, the use of data, tests, and requirements according to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. Compliance with design, equipment, work practice, and operating standards, including those for equipment leaks, shall be determined according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="694"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Applicability assessments.</E> Unless otherwise specified in a relevant test method required to assess control applicability, each test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in this subpart. The arithmetic mean of the results of the three runs shall apply when assessing applicability. Upon receiving approval from the Administrator, results of a test run may be replaced with results of an additional test run if it meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) A sample is accidentally lost after the testing team leaves the site; or</P>
              <P>(B) Conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown; or</P>
              <P>(C) Extreme meteorological conditions occur;</P>
              <P>(D) Other circumstances occur that are beyond the owner or operator's control.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Performance test.</E> (A) The Administrator may determine compliance with emission limitations of this subpart based on, but not limited to, the results of performance tests conducted according to the procedures specified in § 63.997, unless otherwise specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(B) For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance requirements.</E> The Administrator may determine compliance with the operation and maintenance standards of this subpart by, but not limited to, evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards.</E> The Administrator may determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational requirements by, but is not limited to, review of records, inspection of the affected source, and by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements as specified in this subpart, and in the subparts referenced by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Finding of compliance.</E> The Administrator may make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with an emission standard or operating and maintenance requirement as specified in, but not limited to, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, upon obtaining all of the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable) and any information available to the Administrator to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used. Standards in this subpart and methods of determining compliance are in metric units followed by the equivalents in English units. The Administrator will make findings of compliance with the numerical standards of this subpart using metric units.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance time.</E> All terms that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually), unless specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.</P>

              <P>(1) Notwithstanding time periods specified for completion of required tasks, time periods may be changed by <PRTPAGE P="695"/>mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in § 63.1110(h). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.</P>
              <P>(2) When the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) In all instances where a provision requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Startup, shutdown, and malfunction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.</E> The requirements of this paragraph (a) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Description and purpose of plan.</E> The owner or operator of an affected source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. This plan shall also include a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with relevant standards under this subpart. The plan shall also address routine or otherwise predictable CPMS malfunctions. This plan shall be developed by the owner or operator by the affected source's compliance date under this subpart. The requirement to develop this plan shall be incorporated into the source's title V permit. This requirement is optional for equipment that must comply with subparts TT or UU under this subpart. It is not optional for equipment equipped with a closed vent system and control device subject to this subpart and subpart SS of this part. The purpose of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence, in order to minimize excess emissions of regulated organic HAP; and</P>
              <P>(ii) To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).</P>
              <P>(2) Operation of source. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart YY shall operate and maintain such affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of additional procedures.</E> To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator of an affected source may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Revisions to the plan.</E> Based on the results of a determination made under § 63.1108(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as <PRTPAGE P="700"/>specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the affected source that has occurred; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Fails to provide for the operation of the affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified in § 63.1108(a)(5).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional malfunction plan requirements.</E> If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control equipment or CPMS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements.</E> The requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements.</E> If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction of an affected source, or of a control device or monitoring system required for compliance (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, then the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. During the reporting period, reports shall only be required for startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions during which excess emissions, as defined in § 63.1108(a)(5), occur during the reporting period. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction report can be submitted as part of a Periodic Report required under § 63.1110(a)(5), or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise under this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the affected source's title V permit. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate), unless the information is submitted with the Periodic Report. The report shall include the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official certifying its accuracy.</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period if the total duration amounts to either of the durations in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. Records of the number of CPMS startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period are required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Total duration of periods of malfunctioning of a CPMS equal to or greater than 5 percent of that CPMS operating time for the reporting period; or</P>
              <P>(B) Total duration of periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for an affected source equal to or greater than 1 percent of that affected source's operating time for the reporting period.</P>
              <P>(iii) Records documenting each startup, shutdown and malfunction event as required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(F).</P>

              <P>(iv) Records documenting the total duration of operating time as required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(H).<PRTPAGE P="701"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.</E> Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) during which excess emissions occur is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph shall contain the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred. Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph are specified in § 63.1110(h).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Malfunction recordkeeping and reporting.</E> The requirements of this paragraph (c) apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Records of malfunctions.</E> The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, time, and duration of each failure.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</P>
              <P>(iii) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1108(a)(4)(ii), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reports of malfunctions.</E> If a source fails to meet an applicable standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time and duration of each failure. For each failure the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Extension of compliance for early reductions and other reductions.</E> (i) <E T="03">Early reductions.</E> Pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants in accordance with the provisions of subpart D of this part, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with specific requirements of this part, as specified in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other reductions.</E> Pursuant to section 112(i)(6) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source has installed best available control technology (BACT) (as defined in section <PRTPAGE P="702"/>169(3) of the Act) or technology required to meet a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) (as defined in section 171 of the Act) prior to the promulgation of an emission standard in this part applicable to such source and the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) controlled pursuant to the BACT or LAER installation, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with such emission standard that will apply until the date 5 years after the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Request for extension of compliance.</E> Paragraphs (a)(4) through (7) of this section concern requests for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this part (except requests for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section will be handled through procedures specified in subpart D of this part).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Requests for extensions of compliance for section 112 standards.</E> (i) <E T="03">Section 112(d) standards.</E> (A) The owner or operator of an existing source who is unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. The owner or operator of an affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.</P>
              <P>(B) Any request under this paragraph for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority not later than 12 months before the affected source's compliance date (as specified in § 63.1102) for sources that are not including emission points in an emissions average, or not later than 18 months before the affected source's compliance date (as specified in § 63.1102) for sources that are including emission points in an emissions average. Emission standards established under this part may specify alternative dates for the submittal of requests for an extension of compliance if alternatives are appropriate for the source categories affected by those standards, e.g., a compliance date specified by the standard is less than 12 (or 18) months after the standard's effective date.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Section 112(f) standards.</E> The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 2 years after the standard's effective date to comply with the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he/she finds that such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls and that steps will be taken during the period of the extension to assure that the health of persons will be protected from imminent endangerment. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 15 days after the effective date of the relevant standard.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Requests for extensions of compliance for BACT or LAER.</E> The owner or operator of an existing source who has installed BACT or technology required to meet LAER (as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) prior to the promulgation of a relevant emission standard in this part may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source 5 years from the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator, to comply with the standard. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 120 days after the promulgation date of the standard. The <PRTPAGE P="703"/>Administrator may grant such an extension if he or she finds that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Contents of request.</E> (i) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall include the following information:</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of an alternative monitoring method</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Until permission to use an alternative monitoring method has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternatives to monitoring methods.</E> After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring methods or procedures of this part including, but not limited to, the following:</P>

              <P>(i) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a CMS specified by a relevant standard would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances within the effluent gases;<PRTPAGE P="706"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected source is infrequently operated;</P>
              <P>(iii) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate CEMS that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions;</P>
              <P>(iv) Alternative locations for installing CMS when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements;</P>

              <P>(vi) Alternate procedures for performing daily checks of zero (low-level) and high-level drift that do not involve use of high-level gases or test cells;</P>
              <P>(vii) Alternatives to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test methods or sampling procedures specified by any relevant standard;</P>
              <P>(viii) Alternative CMS that do not meet the design or performance requirements in this part, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between their measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements as specified in the relevant standard. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected source; or</P>
              <P>(ix) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected source or the combined effluent from two or more affected sources is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Conflicts between alternative and required methods.</E> If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, requirement, or procedure, the Administrator may require the use of a method, requirement, or procedure specified in this section or in the relevant standard. If the results of the specified and alternative method, requirement, or procedure do not agree, the results obtained by the specified method, requirement, or procedure shall prevail.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) <E T="03">Request to use alternative monitoring method.</E> An owner or operator who wishes to use an alternative monitoring method shall submit an application to the Administrator as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The application may be submitted at any time provided that the monitoring method is not used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard or other requirement. If the alternative monitoring method is to be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard, the application shall be submitted not later than with the site-specific test plan required, or with the site-specific performance evaluation plan (if requested), or at least 60 days before the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin.</P>
              <P>(ii) The application shall contain a description of the proposed alternative monitoring system and a performance evaluation test plan, if required. In addition, the application shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for an alternative monitoring method, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source using the required method.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the submittal dates specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the compliance demonstration date specified in this section or the relevant standard.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Approval of request to use alternative monitoring method.</E> (i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the request to use an alternative monitoring method within 30 days after receipt of the original request and within 30 days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. Before disapproving any request to use an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with—</P>
              <P>(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and</P>

              <P>(B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the <PRTPAGE P="707"/>time the Administrator notifies the applicant of his or her intention to disapprove the request, the Administrator will specify how much time the owner or operator will have after being notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional information.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator may establish general procedures and criteria in a relevant standard to accomplish the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Administrator approves the use of an alternative monitoring method for an affected source under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative monitoring method until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another monitoring method as allowed by this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Alternative to the relative accuracy test.</E> An alternative to the relative accuracy test for CEMS specified in a relevant standard may be requested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Criteria for approval of alternative procedures.</E> An alternative to the test method for determining relative accuracy is available for affected sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. The owner or operator of an affected source may petition the Administrator under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section to substitute the relative accuracy test in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 with the procedures in section 10 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements specified in this subpart or subpart referenced by this subpart demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the relevant standard is less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator to substitute the relative accuracy test with the procedures in section 10 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the CEMS is used continuously to determine compliance with the relevant standard.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Petition to use alternative to relative accuracy test.</E> The petition to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied, the location and the procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative relative accuracy materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure(s). The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The Administrator's determination to approve an alternative will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Rescission of approval to use alternative to relative accuracy test.</E> The Administrator will review the permission to use an alternative to the CEMS relative accuracy test and may rescind such permission if the CEMS data from a successful completion of the alternative relative accuracy procedure indicate that the affected source's emissions are approaching the level of the relevant standard. The criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the relevant standard for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. The owner or operator of the affected source shall maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion for permission to use an alternative for relative accuracy testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions. The <PRTPAGE P="708"/>Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 7 of Performance Specification 2.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</E> (1) Until a waiver of a recordkeeping or reporting requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart and any subparts referenced by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Recordkeeping or reporting requirements may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the affected source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or the source is operating under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.</P>
              <P>(3) If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, any required compliance progress report or compliance status report required under this part or in the source's title V permit, or an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required under § 63.999(c) or another subpart referenced by this subpart, whichever is applicable. The application shall include whatever information the owner or operator considers useful to convince the Administrator that a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is warranted.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this paragraph when he/she—</P>
              <P>(i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required Notification of Compliance Status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.</P>
              <P>(5) A waiver of any recordkeeping or reporting requirement granted under this paragraph may be conditioned on other recordkeeping or reporting requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(6) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternative means of emission limitation.</E> An owner or operator of an affected source may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards of this subpart or of a subpart referenced by this subpart. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (but not performance standards) in this subpart, the Administrator will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.</P>
              <P>(1) The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.</P>

An owner or <PRTPAGE P="709"/>operator of an affected source seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance who has not previously performed testing shall also submit a proposed test plan. If the owner or operator seeks permission to use an alternative means of compliance based on previously performed testing, they shall submit the results of testing, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator who requests an alternative means of emissions limitation shall submit a description of the proposed testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting that will be used and the proposed basis for demonstrating compliance.</P>
              <P>(3) For storage vessels, the owner or operator shall include the results of actual emissions tests using full-size or scale-model storage vessels that accurately collect and measure all regulated HAP emissions using a given control technique, and that accurately simulate wind and account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure, or an engineering analysis that the Administrator determines to be an accurate method of determining equivalence.</P>
              <P>(4) For proposed alternatives to equipment leak requirements referenced by this subpart, the owner or operator shall also submit the information specified in and meet the requirements for alternate means of emission limitation specified in the referenced subparts.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(3) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to facilities that pickle carbon steel without using hydrochloric acid, to facilities that pickle only specialty steel, or to acid regeneration plants that regenerate only acids other than hydrochloric acid.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of implementing this subpart, the affected sources at a facility or plant subject to this subpart are as follows: Continuous and batch pickling lines, hydrochloric acid regeneration plants, and hydrochloric acid storage vessels.</P>
              <P>(c) Table 1 to this subpart specifies the provisions of this part 63, subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of steel pickling facilities and hydrochloric acid regeneration plants subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator must timely meet the reporting requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) The violation was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when exceeded violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and</P>
              <P>(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and</P>
              <P>(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and</P>
              <P>(vii) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</P>
              <P>(viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Report.</E> The owner of operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmation defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess <PRTPAGE P="711"/>emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.</P>

              <P>(a) The owner or operator of a new, reconstructed, or existing steel pickling facility or acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Conduct performance tests to measure the HCl mass flows at the control device inlet and outlet or the concentration of HCl exiting the control device according to the procedures described in § 63.1161 of this subpart. Performance tests shall be conducted either annually or according to an alternative schedule that is approved by the applicable permitting authority, but no less frequently than every 2<FR>1/2</FR> years or twice per title V permit term. If any performance test shows that the HCl emission limitation is being exceeded, then the owner or operator is in violation of the emission limit.</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to conducting performance tests, if a wet scrubber is used as the emission control device, install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the scrubber makeup water flow rate and, if required, recirculation water flow rate. These flow rates must be monitored continuously and recorded at least once per shift while the scrubber is operating. Operation of the wet scrubber with excursions of scrubber makeup water flow rate and recirculation water flow rate less than the minimum values established during the performance test or tests will require initiation of corrective action as specified by the maintenance requirements in § 63.1160(b)(2) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) If an emission control device other than a wet scrubber is used, install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the appropriate operating parameters.</P>
              <P>(4) Failure to record each of the operating parameters listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is a violation of the monitoring requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) Each monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 5 percent and shall be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but not less frequently than once per year.</P>

              <P>(2) Parameters from which proportion of excess air is determined. Proportion of excess air shall be determined by a combination of total air flow rate, fuel flow rate, spent pickle liquor addition rate, and amount of iron in the spent pickle liquor, or by any other combination of parameters approved by the Administrator in accordance with § 63.8(f) of subpart A of this part. Proportion of excess air shall be determined and recorded at least once every shift while the plant is operating in production mode.</P>
              <P>(3) Each monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 5 percent and must be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but not less frequently than once per year.</P>

              <P>(4) Operation of the plant with the process offgas temperature lower than <PRTPAGE P="716"/>the value established during performance testing or with the proportion of excess air greater than the value established during performance testing is a violation of the operational standard specified in § 63.1159(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator of an affected hydrochloric acid storage vessel shall inspect each vessel semiannually to determine that the closed-vent system and either the air pollution control device or the enclosed loading and unloading line, whichever is applicable, are installed and operating when required.</P>

                <P>(c) The bag leak detection system must have an alarm that will sound automatically when it detects an increase in relative PM emissions greater than a preset level.</P>
                <P>(d) The alarm must be located in an area where appropriate plant personnel will be able to hear it.</P>
                <P>(e) For a positive-pressure fabric filter, each compartment or cell must have a bag leak detector. For a negative-pressure or induced-air fabric filter, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter. If multiple bag leak detectors are required (for either type of fabric filter), detectors may share the system instrumentation and alarm.</P>

Other bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained so that they follow the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.</P>
                <P>(g) At a minimum, initial adjustment of the system must consist of establishing the baseline output in both of the following ways:</P>
                <P>(1) Adjust the range and the averaging period of the device.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart DDD of Part 63—Free Formaldehyde Analysis of Insulation Resins by the Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride Method</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Scope</HD>
              <P>The method in this appendix was specifically developed for water-soluble phenolic resins that have a relatively high free-formaldehyde (FF) content such as insulation resins. It may also be suitable for other phenolic resins, especially those with a high FF content.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Principle</HD>

              <P>2.1 a. The basis for this method is the titration of the hydrochloric acid that is liberated when hydroxylamine hydrochloride reacts with formaldehyde to form formaldoxine:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">HCHO + NH2OH:HCl → CH2:NOH + H2O + HCl</FP>
              
              <P>b. Free formaldehyde in phenolic resins is present as monomeric formaldehyde, hemiformals, polyoxymethylene hemiformals, and polyoxymethylene glycols. Monomeric formaldehyde and hemiformals react rapidly with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, but the polymeric forms of formaldehyde must hydrolyze to the monomeric state before they can react. The greater the concentration of free formaldehyde in a resin, the more of that formaldehyde will be in the polymeric form. The hydrolysis of these polymers is catalyzed by hydrogen ions.</P>
              <P>2.2 The resin sample being analyzed must contain enough free formaldehyde so that the initial reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride will produce sufficient hydrogen ions to catalyze the depolymerization of the polymeric formaldehyde within the time limits of the test method. The sample should contain approximately 0.3 grams (g) free formaldehyde to ensure complete reaction within 5 minutes.</P>
