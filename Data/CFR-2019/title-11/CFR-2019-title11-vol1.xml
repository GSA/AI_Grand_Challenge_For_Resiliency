      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <P>(a) After being informed by the Commission that a record system contains a record pertaining to him or her, an individual may request the Commission to disclose that record in the manner described in this section. Each request for the disclosure of a record or a copy of it shall be made at the Federal Election Commission at the street address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2, and to the system manager identified in the notice describing the systems of records, either in writing or in person. Requests may be made by specifically authorized agents or by parents or guardians of individuals.</P>

If the statement is witnessed, it shall include a sentence above the witnesses' signatures that they personally know the individual or that the individual has submitted proof of his or her identification to their satisfaction. In any case in which, because of the extreme sensitivity of the record sought to be seen or copied, the Commission determines that the identification is not adequate, it may request the individual to submit additional proof of identification.</P>
          <P>(2) If the request is made in person, the requestor shall submit proof of identification similar to that described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, acceptable to the Commission.

These exempted systems relate to the Commission's power to exercise exclusive civil jurisdiction over the enforcement of the Act under 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(6) and (e); and to defend itself in actions filed against it under 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(6). Further the Commission has a duty to investigate violations of the Act under 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(2); to conduct audits and investigations pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30111(b), 26 U.S.C. 9007 and 9038; and to refer apparent violations of the Act to the Attorney General or other law enforcement authorities under 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(5) and 30107(a)(9). Information contained in FEC systems 2 and 3 contain the working papers of the Commission staff and form the basis for either civil and/or criminal proceedings pursuant to the exercise of the powers and duties of the Commission. These materials must be protected until such time as they are subject to public access under the provision of 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(4)(B) or 5 U.S.C. 552, or other relevant statutes.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), records contained in FEC 12, Office of Inspector General Investigative Files, are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except subsections (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11) and (f) , and the corresponding provisions of 11 CFR part 1, to the extent this system of records relates in any way to the enforcement of criminal laws.</P>
          <P>(2) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), FEC 12, Office of Inspector General Investigative Files, is exempt from 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), and the corresponding provisions of 11 CFR part 1, to the extent the system of records consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, except for material that falls within the exemption included in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to the extent that application of the subsection would deny any individual any right, privilege or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be entitled to receive.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Meetings required by statute to be closed.</E> Meetings concerning matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statutes which require public withholding in such a manner as to leave no discretion for the Commission on the issue, or which establish particular types of matters to be withheld, shall be closed to public observation in accordance with the procedures of 11 CFR 2.5.</P>
          <P>(1) As required by 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(12), all Commission meetings, or portions of meetings, pertaining to any notification or investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred, shall be closed to the public.</P>
          <P>(2) For the purpose of this section, <E T="03">any notification or investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred</E> includes, but is not limited to, determinations pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30109, the issuance of subpoenas, discussion of referrals to the Department of Justice, or consideration of any other matter related to the Commission's enforcement activity, as set forth in 11 CFR part 111.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Meetings closed by Commission determination.</E> Except as provided in 11 CFR 2.4(c), the requirement of open meetings will not apply where the Commission finds, in accordance with 11 CFR 2.5, that an open meeting or the release of information is likely to result in the disclosure of:</P>

          <P>(5) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:</P>
          <P>(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,</P>
          <P>(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,</P>
          <P>(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>

          <P>(7) Matters that specifically concern the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding, or an arbitration, or involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures for closing meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No meeting or portion of a meeting may be closed to the public observation under this section unless a majority of the Commissioners votes to take such action. The closing of one portion of a meeting shall not justify closing any other portion of a meeting.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Each time the Commission votes to close a meeting, the General Counsel shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, each item on the agenda may properly be closed to public observation. The certification shall state each relevant exemption provision. The original copy of the certification shall be attached to, and preserved with, the statement required by 11 CFR 2.5(d).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Voting procedures.</E> (1) No meeting need be held to consider closing a meeting. The Commission may vote to close a meeting or any portion thereof by using its notation vote procedures.</P>
          <P>(i) A separate vote shall be taken with respect to each item on an agenda proposed to be closed in whole or in part pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4, or with respect to any information proposed to be withheld under 11 CFR 2.4.</P>
          <P>(ii) A single vote may be taken with respect to a particular matter to be discussed in a series of closed meetings, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in the series is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting.</P>
          <P>(iii) This section shall not affect the Commission's practice of setting dates for closed meetings more than 30 days in advance of such meetings.</P>
          <P>(2) The Commission Secretary shall record the vote of each Commissioner participating in the vote. No proxies, written or otherwise, shall be counted.</P>
          <P>(3)(i) A Commissioner may object to a recommendation to close the discussion of a particular matter or may assert a claim of exemption for a matter scheduled to be discussed in an open meeting. Such objection or assertion will be discussed by the Commission at the next scheduled closed meeting, to determine whether the matter in question should be discussed in a closed meeting.</P>
          <P>(ii) An <E T="03">objection for the record only</E> will not cause the objection to be placed on any agenda.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Public statement of vote.</E> (1) If the Commission votes to close a meeting, or any portion thereof, under this section, it shall make publicly available within 24 hours a written statement of the vote. The written statement shall contain:<PRTPAGE P="12"/>

          <P>(i) A citation to the provision(s) of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the meeting was closed to public observation and an explanation of why the specific discussion comes within the cited exemption(s);</P>
          <P>(ii) The vote of each Commissioner participating in the vote;</P>
          <P>(iii) A list of the names of all persons expected to attend the closed meeting and their affiliation. For purposes of this section, affiliation means title or position, and name of employer, and in the case of a representative, the name of the person represented. In the case of Commission employees, the statement will reflect, through the use of titles rather than individual names, that the Commissioners, specified division heads and their staff will attend; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The signature of the Commission Secretary.</P>
          <P>(2) The original copy of the statement shall be maintained by the Commission Secretary. A copy shall be posted on a public bulletin board located in the Commission's Public Records Office.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Public request to close a meeting.</E> A person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request that the Commission close that portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in 11 CFR 2.4. The following procedures shall apply to such requests:</P>
          <P>(1) The request must be made in writing and shall be directed to the Chairman of the Commission.</P>
          <P>(2) The request shall identify the provisions of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the requestor seeks to close all or a portion of the meeting.</P>
          <P>(3) A recorded vote to close the meeting or a portion thereof shall be taken.</P>
          <P>(4) Requests made under this section shall become part of the official record of the underlying matter and shall be disclosed in accordance with 11 CFR 2.6 on completion of the matter.</P>
          <P>(5) If the Commission decides to approve a request to close, the Commission will then follow the procedures for closing a meeting set forth in 11 CFR 2.5 (a) through (d).</P>

          <P>(2) Portions of transcripts or recordings determined to be outside the scope of any exemptions under 11 CFR 2.6(b)(1) shall be promptly made available to the public through the Commission's Public Records Office at a cost sufficient to cover the Commission's actual cost of duplication or transcription. Requests for such copies shall be made and processed in accordance with the provisions of 11 CFR part 5.</P>
          <P>(3) Portions of transcripts or electronic recordings not made available immediately pursuant to 11 CFR 2.6(b)(1), and portions of transcripts or recordings withheld pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4(a), will be made available on request when the relevant exemptions no longer apply. Such materials shall be requested and processed under the provisions of 11 CFR 2.6(b)(2).</P>
          <P>(c) A complete verbatim copy of the transcript or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, shall be maintained by the Commission Secretary in confidential files of the Commission, for a minimum of two years subsequent to such meeting, or a minimum of one year after the conclusion of any agency proceeding with respect to which the meeting, or portion of the meeting, was held, whichever occurs later.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(c) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by 11 CFR 2.7 (a) or (b) only if the Commission announces the change at the earliest practicable time.</P>
          <P>(d) The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or portions of a meeting, to the public may be changed following the public announcement required by 11 CFR 2.7 (a) or (b) only if:</P>

Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the cost of space and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Search</E> means all time spent reviewing, manually or by automated means, Commission records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to a FOIA request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Search time does not include review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining a document located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of the document located is exempt from disclosure. Review also refers to processing any document for disclosure, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, doing all that is necessary to excise exempt portions of the document and otherwise prepare the document for release. Review does not include time spent by the Commission resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Examples of the form such copies can take include, but are not limited to, paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk).</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Commercial use</E> means a purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requestor or the person on whose behalf the request is made. The Commission's determination as to whether documents are being requested for a commercial use will be based on the purpose for which the documents are being requested. Where the Commission has reasonable cause to doubt the use for which the requestor claims to have made the request or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Commission will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
          <P>(l) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>(m) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an organization that is not operated on a commercial basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (k) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(n) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means a person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can <PRTPAGE P="15"/>qualify as disseminators of news, as defined in this paragraph) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a news organization and therefore considered a representative of the news media if that person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by that news organization, even though that person is not actually employed by that organization. The best means by which a freelance journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news organization is by having a publication contract with that news organization. When no such contract is present, the Commission will look to the freelance journalist's past publication record in making this determination.</P>
          <P>(o) <E T="03">Record</E> and any other term used in this part in reference to information includes any information that would be a Commission record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the Commission in any format, including an electronic format.</P>

          <P>(4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to any person under this paragraph (a) and which, because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; and</P>
          <P>(5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), the Commission shall make available, upon proper request, all non-exempt Agency records, or portions of records, not previously made public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2).</P>

          <P>(c) The Commission shall maintain and make available current indexes and supplements providing identifying information regarding any matter issued, adopted or promulgated after April 15, 1975 as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(C) and (E).These indexes and supplements shall be published and made available on at least a quarterly basis for public distribution unless the Commission determines by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that publication would be unnecessary, impracticable, or not feasible due to budgetary considerations. Nevertheless, copies of any index or supplement shall be made <PRTPAGE P="16"/>available upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.</P>
          <P>(d) The Freedom of Information Act and the provisions of this part apply only to existing records; they do not require the creation of new records.</P>
          <P>(e) If documents or files contain both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the disclosable information released unless the disclosable portions cannot be reasonably segregated from the other portions in a manner which will allow meaningful information to be disclosed.</P>
          <P>(f) All records created in the process of implementing provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 will be maintained by the Commission in accordance with the authority granted by General Records Schedule 14, approved by the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Categories of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) No requests under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be denied release unless the record contains, or its disclosure would reveal, matters that are:</P>
          <P>(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
          <P>(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;</P>
          <P>(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
          <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person which are privileged or confidential. Such information includes confidential business information which concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the production, sales, shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers, inventories, or amount of source of income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization, if the disclosure is likely to have the effect of either impairing the Commission's ability to obtain such information as is necessary to perform its statutory functions, or causing substantial harm to the competitive position of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization from which the information was obtained, unless the Commission is required by law to disclose such information. These procedures shall be used for submitting business information in confidence:</P>
          <P>(i) A request for confidential treatment shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, Federal Election Commission, at the street address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2, and shall indicate clearly on the envelope that it is a request for confidential treatment.</P>
          <P>(ii) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the submitter shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public: (A) A written description of the nature of the subject information, and a justification for the request for its confidential treatment, and (B) a certification in writing under oath that substantially identical information is not available to the public.</P>

          <P>(iii) Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designees. A denial shall be in writing, shall specify the reason therefore, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the Commission.<PRTPAGE P="17"/>
          </P>
          <P>(iv) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee if the appeal is filed within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the denial. An appeal shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, Federal Election Commission, at the street address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2 and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) unless an extension, stated in writing with the reasons therefore, has been provided the person making the appeal.</P>
          <P>(v) Any business information submitted in confidence and determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event that any business information submitted to the Commission is not entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to withdraw the tender unless it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act or of judicial discovery proceedings.</P>
          <P>(vi) Since enforcement actions under 52 U.S.C. 30109 are confidential by statute, the procedures outlined in § 4.5(a)(4) (i) thru (v) are not applicable.</P>
          <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party in litigation with the Commission.</P>
          <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
          <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
          <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
          <P>(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
          <P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
          <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>
          <P>(b) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in 11 CFR 4.5(a)(7); and</P>
          <P>(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and</P>
          <P>(2) There is reason to believe that—</P>
          <P>(i) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
          <FP>The agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.</FP>

          <P>(c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt. The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption in paragraph (a) of this section under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.<PRTPAGE P="18"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) If a requested record is one of another government agency or deals with subject matter to which a government agency other than the Commission has exclusive or primary responsibility, the request for such a record shall be promptly referred by the Commission to that agency for disposition or guidance as to disposition.</P>
          <P>(e) Nothing in this part authorizes withholding of information or limiting the availability of records to the public, except as specifically provided in this part; nor is this part authority to withhold information from Congress.</P>

          <P>(a) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(b)(1) Requests for copies of records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall be addressed to Chief FOIA Officer, Federal Election Commission, at the street address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2. The request shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates, and subject matter, to permit the records to be located. A requester will be promptly advised if the records cannot be located on the basis of the description given and that further identifying information must be provided before the request can be satisfied.</P>
          <P>(2) Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The Commission shall accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission shall respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission shall determine within twenty working days after receipt of a request, or twenty working days after an appeal is granted, whether to comply with such request, unless in unusual circumstances the time is extended or subject to § 4.9(f)(3), which governs advance payments. In the event the time is extended, the requestor shall be notified of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made, but in no case shall the extended time exceed ten working days. An extension may be made if it is—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessary to locate records or transfer them from physically separate facilities; or</P>
          <P>(2) Necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a large quantity of separate and distinct records which are the subject of a single request; or</P>
          <P>(3) Necessary for consultation with another agency which has a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or with two or more components of the Commission which have a substantial subject matter interest therein.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Commission determines that an extension of time greater than ten working days is necessary to respond to a request satisfying the “unusual circumstances” specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission shall so notify the requester and give the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or arrange with the Commission an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.</P>

          <P>(e) The Commission may aggregate and process as a single request requests by the same requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, if the Commission reasonably believes that the requests actually constitute a single request that would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the requests involve clearly related matters.<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
          </P>
          <P>(f) The Commission uses a multitrack system to process requests under the Freedom of Information Act that is based on the amount of work and/or time involved in processing requests. Requests for records are processed in the order they are received within each track. Upon receipt of a request for records, the Commission shall determine which track is appropriate for the request. The Commission may contact requesters whose requests do not appear to qualify for the fastest tracks and provide such requesters the opportunity to limit their requests so as to qualify for a faster track. Requesters who believe that their requests qualify for the fastest tracks and who wish to be notified if the Commission disagrees may so indicate in the request and, where appropriate and feasible, shall also be given an opportunity to limit their requests.</P>
          <P>(g) The Commission shall consider requests for the expedited processing of requests in cases where the requester demonstrates a compelling need for such processing.</P>
          <P>(1) The term compelling need means:</P>
          <P>(i) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
          <P>(ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal government activity.</P>
          <P>(2) Requesters for expedited processing must include in their requests a statement setting forth the basis for the claim that a “compelling need” exists for the requested information, certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.</P>
          <P>(3) The Commission shall determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing and notify the requester of such determination within ten days of receipt of the request. Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed as set forth in § 4.8. The Commission shall expeditiously determine any such appeal. As soon as practicable, the Commission shall process the documents responsive to a request for which expedited processing is granted.</P>
          <P>(h) Any person denied access to records by the Commission shall be notified immediately giving reasons therefore, and notified of the right of such person to appeal such adverse determination to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(i) The date of receipt of a request under this part shall be the date on which the FOIA Officer actually receives the request.</P>

          <P>(a) Any person who has been notified pursuant to § 4.7(h) of this part that his/her request for inspection of a record or for a copy has been denied, or who has received no response within twenty working days (or within such extended period as is permitted under § 4.7(c) of this part) after the request has been received by the Commission, may appeal the adverse determination or the failure to respond by requesting the Commission to direct that the record be made available.</P>
          <P>(b) The appeal request shall be in writing, shall clearly and prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page “FOIA Appeal”, and shall identify the record in the form in which it was originally requested.</P>
          <P>(c) The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, Federal Election Commission, at the street address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2.</P>
          <P>(d) The requestor may state facts and cite legal or other authorities as he/she deems appropriate in support of the appeal request.</P>
          <P>(e) For good cause shown, the Commission may disclose a record which is subject to one of the exemptions listed in § 4.5 of this part.</P>

          <P>(f) The Commission will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after receipt of the appeal (or within such extended period as is permitted under § 4.7(c) of this part). If on appeal, the <PRTPAGE P="20"/>denial of the request for a record or a copy is in whole or in part upheld, the Commission shall advise the requestor of the denial and shall notify him/her of the provisions for judicial review of that determination as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).</P>
          <P>(g) Because of the risk of misunderstanding inherent in oral communications, the Commission will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has orally requested a copy of a record that he/she believes to have been improperly denied should resubmit the request in writing as set forth in § 4.7.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exceptions to fee charges</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Except for a commercial use requester, the Commission will not charge a fee to any requester for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication in response to any FOIA request.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Free computer search time.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, the term <E T="03">search time</E> is based on the concept of a manual search. To apply this to a search conducted by a computer, the Commission will provide the equivalent dollar value of two hours of professional staff time, calculated according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, in computer search time. Computer search time is determined by adding the cost of the computer connect time actually used for the search, calculated at the rate of $25.00 per hour, to the cost of the operator's salary for the time spent conducting the computer search, calculated at the professional staff time rate set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Definition of pages.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, the word <E T="03">pages</E> refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will normally be 8<FR>1/2</FR>″ × 11″ or 8<FR>1/2</FR>″ × 14″. Thus, while a requester would not be entitled to 100 free computer disks, for example, a requester would be entitled to 100 free pages of a computer printout.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Minimum charge.</E> The Commission will not charge a fee to any requester when the allowable direct cost of that FOIA request is equal to or less than the Commission's cost of routinely collecting and processing a FOIA request fee.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Fee reduction or waiver</E>—(1) The Commission will consider requests for the reduction or waiver of any fees assessed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it determines, either as a result of its own motion or in response to a written submission by the requester, that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and that disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
          <P>(2) A request for a reduction or waiver of fees shall be made in writing by the FOIA requestor; shall accompany the relevant FOIA request so as to be considered timely; and shall include a specific explanation as to why the fee for that FOIA request should be reduced or waived, applying the standard stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the facts of that particular request. In addition, the explanation shall include: the requester's (and user's, if the requester and the user are different persons or entities) identity, qualifications and expertise in the subject area, and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public; and a discussion of any commercial or personal benefit that the requestor (and user, if the requestor and user are different persons or entities) expects as a result of disclosure, including whether the information disclosed would be resold in any form at a fee above actual cost.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees to be charged.</E> (1) The FOIA services provided by the Commission in response to a FOIA request for which the requestor will be charged will depend upon the category of the requestor. The categories of FOIA requestors are as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requestors.</E> A requestor of documents for commercial use will be assessed reasonable standard charges for the full allowable direct costs of searching for, reviewing <PRTPAGE P="21"/>for release and duplicating the records sought, according to the Commission's schedule of fees for those services as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A commercial use requestor is not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication of documents.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requestors.</E> The Commission will provide documents to requestors in this category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requestors must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requestors who are representatives of the news media.</E> The Commission will provide documents to requestors in this category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, the requestor must meet the criteria listed at 11 CFR 4.1(n) and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requestor shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">All other requestors.</E> The Commission will charge requestors who do not fit into any of the categories listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section the full direct costs of searching for and duplicating records in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication. Requests from persons for records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which permit fees only for duplication.</P>
          <P>(2) The Commission may assess fees for the full allowable direct costs of searching for documents in response to a request even if the Commission fails to locate any documents which are responsive to that request and, in the case of commercial use requestors, of reviewing documents located in response to a request which the Commission determines are exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(3) If the Commission estimates that search or duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requestor of the estimated amount of the fee unless the requestor has indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee as high as that estimated by the Commission. Through this notification, the Commission will offer the requestor the opportunity to confer with Commission staff to reformulate the original request in order to meet the requestor's needs at a lower cost.</P>

          <P>(4) The following is the schedule of the Commission's standard fees. The cost of staff time will be added to all of the following fees, generally at the <E T="03">Professional</E> rate listed below, except for the cost of <E T="03">Photocopying from photocopying machines</E> which has been calculated to include staff time.</P>

If the invoice is unpaid on the 31st day following the day on which the invoice was sent, the Commission will begin assessing interest charges, which will accrue from the date the invoice was mailed. Interest will be charged at a rate that is equal to the average investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717.

          <P>(e) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requestor may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a FOIA requestor or group of requestors acting in concert is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Commission will aggregate any such requests and charge the appropriate fees. In making this determination, the Commission will consider the time period in which the requests have occurred, the relationship of the requestors, and the subject matter of the requests.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> The Commission will require a requestor to make an advance payment, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, a payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, when:</P>
          <P>(1) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requestor may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. In such a case, the Commission will notify the requestor of the likely cost and, where the requestor has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment, or in the case of a requestor with no FOIA fee payment history, the Commission will require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges; or</P>

          <P>(2) A requestor has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, within 30 days of the date of the billing). In such a case, the Commission <PRTPAGE P="23"/>may require that the requestor pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest or demonstrate that the fee has been paid and make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Commission begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requestor.</P>
          <P>(3) If the provisions of paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section apply, the administrative time limits prescribed in 11 CFR 4.7(c) will begin only after the Commission has received the payments or the requestor has made acceptable arrangements to make the payments required by paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section.</P>

          <P>(c) In the event the anticipated fees for all pending requests from the same requester exceed $25.00, records will not be searched, nor copies furnished, until the requester pays, or makes acceptable arrangements to pay, the total amount due.</P>

          <P>Similarly, if the records requested require the production of microfilm or of computer tapes, the Commission <PRTPAGE P="26"/>will not instruct its contractor to duplicate the records until the requester has submitted payment as directed or has made acceptable arrangements to pay the total amount due. If any fee is not precisely ascertainable, an estimate will be made by the Commission and the requester will be required to forward the fee so estimated. In the event any advance payment differs from the actual fee, an appropriate adjustment will be made at the time the copies are made available by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(d) The Commission may reduce or waive payments of fees hereunder if it determines that such waiver or reduction is in the public interest because the furnishing of the requested information to the particular requester involved can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public as opposed to primarily benefiting the person or organization requesting the information.</P>

          <P>(ii) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Has none of the impairments defined in 11 CFR 6.103(e)(1) but is treated by the agency as having such an impairment.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Qualified handicapped person</E> means—</P>
          <P>(1) With respect to any Commission program or activity under which a person is required to perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment, a handicapped person who, with reasonable accommodation, meets the essential eligibility requirements and who can achieve the purpose of the program or activity; and</P>

This evaluation will include a determination of whether the Commission's policies and practices, and the effects thereof, meet the requirements of this part and whether modification of any <PRTPAGE P="28"/>such policies or practices is required to comply with section 504. If modification of any policy or practice is found to be required as a result of this evaluation, the Commission will proceed to make the necessary modifications.</P>
          <P>(b) For at least three years following completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (a), the Commission will maintain on file and make available for public inspection:</P>
          <P>(1) A list of the interested persons consulted;</P>

          <P>(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program, except that this paragraph does not apply to candidates or conventions receiving public financing under title 26, United States Code;</P>
          <P>(vi) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in 11 CFR 6.150 and 11 CFR 6.151, no qualified handicapped person shall be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Commission because its facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility; Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission will operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with 11 CFR 6.150(a) would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Commission after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The Commission may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of <PRTPAGE P="30"/>aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing buildings, will meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission will give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The Commission will comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes will be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Commission will develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan will be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons and organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan will be made available for public inspection. The plan will, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and</P>
          <P>(5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan was prepared.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constucted or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Commission shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <P>(a) The Commission will take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The Commission will furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(i) In determination what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Commission will give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The Commission need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the Commission communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), or equally effective telecommunication systems will be used.</P>

          <P>(b) The Commission will ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence <PRTPAGE P="31"/>and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission will provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) The Commission will take appropriate steps to provide handicapped persons with information regarding their section 504 rights under the Commission's programs of activities.</P>
          <P>(e) This section does not require the Commission to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Commission after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(b) For the purpose of this subpart, a contribution or payment made by an individual shall not be attributed to any other individual, unless otherwise specified by that other individual in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A gift, subscription, loan (except for a loan made in accordance with 11 CFR 100.82 and 100.83), advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office is a contribution.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">loan</E> includes a guarantee, endorsement, and any other form of security.</P>
              <P>(1) A loan that exceeds the contribution limitations of 52 U.S.C. 30116 and 11 CFR part 110 shall be unlawful whether or not it is repaid.</P>
              <P>(2) A loan is a contribution at the time it is made and is a contribution to the extent that it remains unpaid. The aggregate amount loaned to a candidate or committee by a contributor, when added to other contributions from that individual to that candidate or committee, shall not exceed the contribution limitations set forth at 11 CFR part 110. A loan, to the extent it is repaid, is no longer a contribution.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a loan is a contribution by each endorser or guarantor. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a loan by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.</P>
              <P>(4) A candidate may obtain a loan on which his or her spouse's signature is required when jointly owned assets are used as collateral or security for the loan. The spouse shall not be considered a contributor to the candidate's campaign if the value of the candidate's share of the property used as collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the loan that is used for the candidate's campaign.</P>

              <P>(5) If a political committee makes a loan to any person, such loan shall be subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. Repayment of the principal amount of such loan to such political <PRTPAGE P="51"/>committee shall not be a contribution by the debtor to the lender committee. Such repayment shall be made with funds that are subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.20 and part 114. The payment of interest to such committee by the debtor shall be a contribution only to the extent that the interest paid exceeds a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the loan is made. All payments of interest shall be made from funds subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.20 and part 114.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">money</E> includes currency of the United States or of any foreign nation, checks, money orders, or any other negotiable instruments payable on demand.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">anything of value</E> includes all in-kind contributions. Unless specifically exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C, the provision of any goods or services without charge or at a charge that is less than the usual and normal charge for such goods or services is a contribution. Examples of such goods or services include, but are not limited to: Securities, facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, advertising services, membership lists, and mailing lists. If goods or services are provided at less than the usual and normal charge, the amount of the in-kind contribution is the difference between the usual and normal charge for the goods or services at the time of the contribution and the amount charged the political committee.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, <E T="03">usual and normal charge for goods</E> means the price of those goods in the market from which they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time of the contribution; and usual and normal charge for any services, other than those provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered.</P>

No compensation is considered paid to any employee under any of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Paid on an hourly or salaried basis.</E> If an employee is paid on an hourly or salaried basis and is expected to work a particular number of hours per period, no contribution results if the employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be a regular work period, provided that the taken or released time is made up or completed by the employee within a reasonable time.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Paid on commission or piecework basis.</E> No contribution results where an employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be normal working hours if the employee is paid on a commission or piecework basis, or is paid only for work actually performed and the employee's time is considered his or her own to use as he or she sees fit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Vacation or earned leave time.</E> No contribution results where the time used by the employee to engage in political activity is bona fide, although compensable, vacation time or other earned leave time.</P>

If <PRTPAGE P="52"/>a creditor fails to make a commercially reasonable attempt to collect the debt, a contribution will result. (See 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.) If a debt owed by a political committee is forgiven or settled for less than the amount owed, a contribution results unless such debt is settled in accordance with the standards set forth at 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.</P>

A loan will be deemed to be made in the ordinary course of business if it:</P>
              <P>(1) Bears the usual and customary interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan involved;</P>
              <P>(2) Is made on a basis that assures repayment;</P>
              <P>(3) Is evidenced by a written instrument; and</P>
              <P>(4) Is subject to a due date or amortization schedule.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> Such loans shall be reported by the political committee in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a) and (d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Endorsers and guarantors.</E> Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement, except that, in the event of a signature by the candidate's spouse, the provisions of 11 CFR 100.52(b)(4) shall apply. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a contribution by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Overdrafts.</E> For purposes of this section, an overdraft made on a checking or savings account of a political committee shall be considered a contribution by the bank or institution unless:</P>

              <P>(2) The overdraft is subject to a definite interest rate that is usual and customary; and<PRTPAGE P="55"/>

              <P>(3) There is a definite repayment schedule.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Made on a basis that assures repayment.</E> A loan, including a line of credit, shall be considered made on a basis that assures repayment if it is obtained using either of the sources of repayment described in paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, or a combination of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political committee receiving the loan, the fair market value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as determined on the date of the loan, and the candidate or political committee provides documentation to show that the lending institution has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate, personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on deposit.</P>
              <P>(ii) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, 110.20, part 114 and part 115; or</P>
              <P>(2) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012, or part 9031 through part 9039, contributions, or interest income, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of the loan or loans obtained on the basis of such funds does not exceed the amount of pledged funds;</P>

              <P>(ii) Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political committee must furnish the lending institution documentation, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, cash flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that such future funds will be available;</P>
              <P>(iii) A separate depository account is established at the lending institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or political committee to access funds in a committee account at another depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;</P>
              <P>(iv) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing payments, contributions and interest income pledged as collateral into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan agreement; and</P>
              <P>(v) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt.</P>
              <P>(3) If the requirements set forth in this paragraph are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of the circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was made on a basis that assures repayment.</P>

              <P>(2) Any repayment, in part or in whole, of the loan, advance, or line of credit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the candidate's authorized committee constitutes the personal use of campaign funds and is prohibited by 11 CFR 113.2.</P>

              <P>(ii) Every campaign traveler for whom payment is not made under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section pays the service provider for the full value of the transportation provided to that campaign traveler as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.79 and 100.139 for treatment of certain unreimbursed transportation expenses incurred by individuals traveling on behalf of candidates, authorized committees, and political committees of political parties.</P>

Contributions are subject to the reporting requirements, limitations and prohibitions of the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) When a candidate is accompanied by a member of the news media, or by security personnel provided by any Federal or State government, the news media or government security provider may reimburse the political committee paying for the pro-rata share of the travel by the member of the media or security personnel, or may pay the service provider directly for that pro-rata share, up to the applicable amount set forth in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(3), (d), (e), or (g) of this section. A payment made directly to the service provider may be subtracted from the amount for which the political committee is otherwise responsible without any contribution resulting.

The pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge by the number of campaign travelers on the flight that are traveling on behalf of such candidates or their authorized committees, including members of the news media, and security personnel traveling with a candidate. No portion of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge may be attributed to any campaign travelers that are not traveling on behalf of such candidates or their authorized committees, or any other passengers, except as permitted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>

A loan will be deemed to be made in the ordinary course of business if it:</P>
              <P>(1) Bears the usual and customary interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan involved;</P>
              <P>(2) Is made on a basis that assures repayment;</P>

Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that the loan agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered an expenditure by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.</P>

              <P>(1)(i) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political committee receiving the loan; the fair market value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as determined on the date of the loan; and the candidate or political committee provides documentation to show that the lending institution has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate, personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on deposit.</P>
              <P>(ii) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, 110.20, part 114 and part 115; or</P>
              <P>(2) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012 or part 9031 through 9039, contributions, or interest income, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of the loan(s) obtained the basis of such funds does not exceed the amount of pledged funds;</P>

              <P>(ii) Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political committee must furnish the lending institution documentation, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, cash flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that such future funds will be available;</P>
              <P>(iii) A separate depository account is established at the lending institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or political committee to access funds in a committee account at another depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;</P>
              <P>(iv) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing payments, contributions, interest or other income pledged as collateral into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan; and</P>
              <P>(v) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt.</P>

              <P>(3) If the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was made on a basis that assures repayment.<PRTPAGE P="71"/>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate depository account.</E> (i) The participants or the fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate depository account must be permissible under the Act. Each political committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the account as an additional depository. If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, the participants may either establish a second depository account for contributions received from prohibited sources or they may forward such contributions directly to the nonfederal participants.</P>
            <P>(ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.</P>
            <P>(iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising representative. The fundraising representative shall report contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 102.17(c)(8) when such funds are received from the fundraising representative.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> (i) The fundraising representative and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 are observed. Participating political committees shall make their contributor records available to the fundraising representative to enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen contributions.</P>
            <P>(ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating political committees. The fundraising representative shall also keep a record of the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources, if any, and of all transfers of prohibited contributions to participants that can accept them.</P>
            <P>(iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records required under 11 CFR 102.9 regarding fundraising disbursements for a period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall forward such information to the fundraising representative.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Contribution limitations.</E> Except to the extent that the contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Allocation of gross proceeds.</E> (i) The fundraising representative shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the fundraising agreement. If distribution according to the allocation formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants and results in a surplus for those participants or if distribution under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(a), the fundraising <PRTPAGE P="89"/>representative may reallocate the excess funds. Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participants' proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of the contribution that exceeds the limit.</P>
            <P>(ii) Designated contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated by the fundraising representative absent the prior written permission of the contributor.</P>
            <P>(iii) If any participants can lawfully accept contributions from sources prohibited under the Act, any such contributions that are received are not required to be distributed according to the allocation formula.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds.</E> (i) If participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the same political party;</P>
            <P>(A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6), the fundraising representative shall calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. If contributions from sources prohibited under the Act have been received and distributed under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6)(iii), those contributions need not be included in the total receipts for the purpose of allocating expenses under this section. To calculate each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.</P>
            <P>(B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110.</P>
            <P>(C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same throughout the series.</P>
            <P>(ii) If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a political committee.</P>
            <P>(iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the fundraising representative.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Reporting of receipts and disbursements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Reporting receipts.</E> (A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in the reporting period in which they are received. The fundraising representative shall report the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources during the reporting period, if any, as a memo entry. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.</P>
            <P>(B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reporting disbursements.</E> The fundraising representative shall report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notification of the commission.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Each committee shall notify the Commission of the campaign depository(ies) it has designated, pursuant to 11 CFR 101.1 and 103.2.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Depositories (52 U.S.C. 30102(h)(1)).</SUBJECT>
            <P>Each political committee shall designate one or more State banks, federally chartered depository institutions (including a national bank), or depository institutions the depositor accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration, as its campaign depository or depositories. One or more depositories may be established in one or more States. Each political committee shall maintain at least one checking account or transaction account at one of its depositories. Additional accounts may be established at each depository.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Deposit of receipts and disbursements (52 U.S.C. 30102(h)(1)).</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All receipts by a political committee shall be deposited in account(s) established pursuant to 11 CFR 103.2, except that any contribution may be, within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt, returned to the contributor without being deposited. The treasurer of the committee shall be responsible for making such deposits. All deposits shall be made within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt. A committee shall make all disbursements by check or similar drafts drawn on an account at its designated campaign depository, except for expenditures of $100 or less made from a petty cash fund maintained pursuant to 11 CFR 102.11. Funds may be transferred from the depository for investment purposes, but shall be returned to the depository before such funds are used to make expenditures.</P>
            <P>(b) The treasurer shall be responsible for examining all contributions received for evidence of illegality and for ascertaining whether contributions received, when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor, exceed the contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2.</P>
            <P>(1) Contributions that present genuine questions as to whether they were made by corporations, labor organizations, foreign nationals, or Federal contractors may be, within ten days of the treasurer's receipt, either deposited into a campaign depository under 11 CFR 103.3(a) or returned to the contributor. If any such contribution is deposited, the treasurer shall make his or her best efforts to determine the legality of the contribution. The treasurer shall make at least one written or oral request for evidence of the legality of the contribution. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, a written statement from the contributor explaining why the contribution is legal, or a written statement by the treasurer memorializing an oral communication explaining why the contribution is legal. If the contribution cannot be determined to be legal, the treasurer shall, within thirty days of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, refund the contribution to the contributor.</P>
            <P>(2) If the treasurer in exercising his or her responsibilities under 11 CFR 103.3(b) determined that at the time a contribution was received and deposited, it did not appear to be made by a corporation, labor organization, foreign national or Federal contractor, or made in the name of another, but later discovers that it is illegal based on new evidence not available to the political committee at the time of receipt and deposit, the treasurer shall refund the contribution to the contributor within thirty days of the date on which the illegality is discovered. If the political committee does not have sufficient funds to refund the contribution at the time the illegality is discovered, the political committee shall make the refund from the next funds it receives.</P>

            <P>(3) Contributions which on their face exceed the contribution limitations set forth in 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, and contributions which do not appear to be excessive on their face, but which exceed the contribution limits set forth in 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2 when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor, and contributions which cannot be accepted under <PRTPAGE P="91"/>the net debts outstanding provisions of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3) and 110.2(b)(3) may be either deposited into a campaign depository under 11 CFR 103.3(a) or returned to the contributor. If any such contribution is deposited, the treasurer may request redesignation or reattribution of the contribution by the contributor in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b), 110.1(k) or 110.2(b), as appropriate. If a redesignation or reattribution is not obtained, the treasurer shall, within sixty days of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, refund the contribution to the contributor.</P>
            <P>(4) Any contribution which appears to be illegal under 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1) or (3), and which is deposited into a campaign depository shall not be used for any disbursements by the political committee until the contribution has been determined to be legal. The political committee must either establish a separate account in a campaign depository for such contributions or maintain sufficient funds to make all such refunds.</P>
            <P>(5) If a contribution which appears to be illegal under 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1) or (3) is deposited in a campaign depository, the treasurer shall make and retain a written record noting the basis for the appearance of illegality. A statement noting that the legality of the contribution is in question shall be included in the report noting the receipt of the contribution. If a contribution is refunded to the contributor because it cannot be determined to be legal, the treasurer shall note the refund on the report covering the reporting period in which the refund is made.</P>

This paragraph (d)(3) shall not apply to any Schedule C-1 or C-P-1 that is filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) When a candidate obtains a bank loan or loan of money derived from an advance on the candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other line of credit described in 11 CFR 100.83 and 100.143 for use in connection with the candidate's campaign, the candidate's principal campaign committee shall disclose in the report covering the period when the loan was obtained, the following information on Schedule C-1 or C-P-1:</P>

            <P>(4) No authorized committee of a candidate shall attribute more than $1,000 in contributions to the same pseudonym for each election and no other political committee shall attribute more than $5,000 in contributions to the same pseudonym in any calendar year.</P>
            <P>(5) A committee using pseudonyms shall send a list of such pseudonyms under separate cover directly to the Reports Analysis Division, Federal Election Commission, at the street address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2, on or before the date on which any report containing such pseudonyms is filed with the Secretary of the Senate or the Commission. The Commission shall maintain the list, but shall exclude it from the public record. A committee shall not send any list of pseudonyms to the Secretary of the Senate or to any Secretary of State or equivalent state officer.</P>

See 11 CFR 300.35. Such a receipt is a contribution subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act and reportable as a contribution, regardless of whether the contributor has designated the funds or <PRTPAGE P="99"/>things of value for such purpose and regardless of whether such funds are deposited in a separate Federal account dedicated to that purpose.</P>
            <P>(2) Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are donated to a non-Federal account of a State or local party committee and are used by that party committee for the purchase or construction of its office building are not contributions subject to the reporting requirements of the Act. The reporting of such funds or things of value is subject to State law.</P>
            <P>(3) Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are used by a national committee of a political party to defray the costs of construction or purchase of the national committee's office building are contributions subject to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Legal and accounting services.</E> A committee which receives legal or accounting services pursuant to 11 CFR 100.85 and 100.86 shall report as a memo entry, on Schedule A, the amounts paid for these services by the regular employer of the person(s) providing such services; the date(s) such services were performed; and the name of each person performing such services.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Cumulative reports.</E> The reports required to be filed under § 104.5 shall be cumulative for the calendar year (or for the election cycle, in the case of an authorized committee) to which they relate, but if there has been no change in a category reported in a previous report during that year (or during that election cycle, in the case of an authorized committee), only the amount thereof need be carried forward.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Earmarked contributions.</E> Earmarked contributions shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6. <E T="03">See also</E> 11 CFR 102.8(c).</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Reporting Election Cycle Activity Occurring Prior to January 1, 2001.</E> The aggregate of each category of receipt listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except those in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, and for each category of disbursement listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall include amounts received or disbursed on or after the day after the last general election for the seat or office for which the candidate is running through December 31, 2000.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Regularly scheduled reporting.</E> Every political committee that makes independent expenditures must report all such independent expenditures on Schedule E in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii). Every person that is not a political committee must report independent expenditures in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and 11 CFR 109.10.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reports of independent expenditures made at any time up to and including the 20th day before an election</E>—(1) <E T="03">Independent expenditures aggregating less than $10,000 in a calendar year.</E> For each election in which a political committee makes independent expenditures, the political committee shall aggregate its independent expenditures made in each calendar year to determine its reporting obligation. When a committee makes independent expenditures aggregating less than $10,000 for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, the committee must report those independent expenditures on Schedule E of FEC Form 3X, at the time of its regular reports in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3, 104.5, and 104.9.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more in a calendar year.</E> For each election in which a political committee makes independent expenditures, the political committee shall aggregate its independent expenditures made in each calendar year to determine its reporting obligation. When a committee makes independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, it must report those independent expenditures on Schedule E of FEC Form 3X. Political committees must ensure that the Commission receives these reports by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $10,000 or more, the political committee must ensure that the Commission receives a new 48-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which the communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. (<E T="03">See</E> paragraph (f) of this section for aggregation.) Each 48-hour report must contain the information required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii) indicating whether the independent expenditure is made in support of, or in opposition to, the candidate involved. In addition to other permissible means of filing, a political committee may file the 48-hour reports under this section by any of the means permissible under 11 CFR 100.19(d)(3).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reports of independent expenditures made less than 20 days, but more than 24 hours before the day of an election.</E> Political committees must ensure that the Commission receives reports of independent expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more with respect to a given election, after the 20th day, but more than 24 hours before 12:01 a.m. of the day of the election, by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $1,000 or more, the political committee must ensure that the Commission receives a new 24-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. (See paragraph (f) of this section for aggregation.) Each 24-hour report shall contain the information required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii) indicating whether the independent expenditure is made in support of, or in opposition to, the candidate involved. Political committees may file reports <PRTPAGE P="101"/>under this section by any of the means permissible under 11 CFR 100.19(d)(3).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification.</E> Political committees must verify reports of independent expenditures filed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section by one of the methods stated in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. Any report verified under either of these methods shall be treated for all purposes (including penalties for perjury) in the same manner as a document verified by signature.</P>
            <P>(1) For reports filed on paper (e.g., by hand-delivery, U.S. Mail or facsimile machine), the treasurer of the political committee that made the independent expenditure must certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by handwritten signature immediately following the certification required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii).</P>
            <P>(2) For reports filed by electronic mail, the treasurer of the political committee that made the independent expenditure shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by typing the treasurer's name immediately following the certification required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Where to file.</E> Reports of independent expenditures under this section and 11 CFR 109.10(b) shall be filed as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) For independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for President or Vice President: with the Commission and the Secretary of State for the State in which the expenditure is made.</P>
            <P>(2) For independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for the Senate:</P>
            <P>(i) For regularly scheduled reports, with the Secretary of the Senate and the Secretary of State for the State in which the candidate is seeking election; or</P>

            <P>(3) For independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for the House of Representatives: with the Commission and the Secretary of State for the State in which the candidate is seeking election.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, political committees and other persons shall not be required to file reports of independent expenditures with the Secretary of State if that State has obtained a waiver under 11 CFR 108.1(b).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Aggregating independent expenditures for reporting purposes.</E> For purposes of determining whether 24-hour and 48-hour reports must be filed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and 11 CFR 109.10(c) and (d), aggregations of independent expenditures must be calculated as of the first date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated, and as of the date that any such communication with respect to the same election is subsequently publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Every person must include in the aggregate total all disbursements during the calendar year for independent expenditures, and all enforceable contracts, either oral or written, obligating funds for disbursements during the calendar year for independent expenditures, where those independent expenditures are made with respect to the same election for Federal office.</P>

            <P>(1)(i) All written solicitations for contributions include a clear request for the contributor's full name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer, and include an accurate statement of Federal law regarding the collection and reporting of individual contributor identifications.</P>
            <P>(A) The following are examples of acceptable statements for unauthorized committees, but are not the only allowable statements: “Federal law requires us to use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in a calendar year;” and “To comply with Federal law, we must use best efforts to obtain, maintain, and submit the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 per calendar year.”</P>

Such effort shall consist of either a written request sent to the contributor or an oral request to the contributor documented in writing. The written or oral request must be made no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the contribution. The written or oral request shall not include material on any other subject or any additional solicitation, except that it may include language solely thanking the contributor for the contribution. The request must clearly ask for the missing information, and must include the statement set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Written requests must include this statement in a clear and conspicuous manner. If the request is written, it shall be accompanied by a pre-addressed return post card or envelope for the response material;</P>
            <P>(3) The treasurer reports all contributor information not provided by the contributor, but in the political committee's possession, or in its connected organization's possession, regarding contributor identifications, including information in contributor records, fundraising records and previously filed reports, in the same two-year election cycle in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3; and</P>
            <P>(4)(i) If any of the contributor information is received after the contribution has been disclosed on a regularly scheduled report, the political committee shall either:</P>
            <P>(A) File with its next regularly scheduled report, an amended memo Schedule A listing all contributions for which contributor identifications have been received during the reporting period covered by the next regularly scheduled report together with the dates and amounts of the contribution(s) and an indication of the previous report(s) to which the memo Schedule A relates; or</P>
            <P>(B) File on or before its next regularly scheduled reporting date, amendments to the report(s) originally disclosing the contribution(s), which include the contributor identifications together with the dates and amounts of the contribution(s).</P>
            <P>(ii) Amendments must be filed for all reports that cover the two-year election cycle in which the contribution was received and that disclose itemizable contributions from the same contributor.

            <P>(a) Debts and obligations owed by or to a political committee which remain outstanding shall be continuously reported until extinguished. See 11 CFR 104.3(d). These debts and obligations shall be reported on separate schedules together with a statement explaining the circumstances and conditions under which each debt and obligation was incurred or extinguished. Where such debts and obligations are settled for less than their reported amount or value, the reporting committee shall include a statement as to the circumstances and conditions under which the debt or obligation was extinguished and the amount paid.</P>

            <P>(b) A debt or obligation, including a loan, written contract, written promise or written agreement to make an expenditure, the amount of which is $500 or less, shall be reported as of the time payment is made or not later than 60 days after such obligation is incurred, whichever comes first. A debt or obligation, including a loan, written contract, written promise or written agreement to make an expenditure, the amount of which is over $500 shall be reported as of the date on which the debt or obligation is incurred, except that any obligation incurred for rent, salary or other regularly reoccurring administrative expense shall not be reported as a debt before the payment due date. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 116.6. If the exact amount of a debt or obligation is not known, the report shall state that the amount reported is an estimate. Once the exact amount is determined, the political committee shall either amend the report(s) containing the estimate or indicate the correct amount on the report for the reporting period in which such amount is determined.</P>

            <P>(ii) In each subsequent report in the calendar year itemizing an allocated disbursement, the State, district, or local party committee shall state the category of activity for which each allocated disbursement was made, and shall summarize the total amounts expended from Federal and non-Federal accounts, or from allocation accounts, that year to date for each such category.</P>
            <P>(iii) In each report disclosing disbursements for allocable activities as described in 11 CFR 106.7, the State, district, or local party committee shall assign a unique identifying title or code to each such program or activity, and shall state the applicable Federal/non-Federal percentage for any direct costs of fundraising. Unique identifying titles or codes are not required for salaries and wages pursuant to 11 CFR 106.7(c)(1), or for other administrative costs allocated pursuant to 11 CFR 106.7(c)(2).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) Expenditures, including in-kind contributions, independent expenditures, and coordinated expenditures made on behalf of more than one clearly identified Federal candidate shall be attributed to each such candidate according to the benefit reasonably expected to be derived. For example, in the case of a publication or broadcast communication, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of space or time devoted to each candidate as compared to the total space or time devoted to all candidates. In the case of a fundraising program or event where funds are collected by one committee for more than one clearly identified candidate, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of funds received by each candidate as compared to the total receipts by all candidates. In the case of a phone bank, the attribution shall be determined by the number of questions or statements devoted to each candidate as compared to the total number of questions or statements devoted to all candidates. These methods shall also be used to allocate payments involving both expenditures on behalf of one or more clearly identified Federal candidates and disbursements on behalf of one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates.</P>
            <P>(2) An expenditure made on behalf of more than one clearly identified Federal candidate shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a) or 104.17(a), as appropriate. A payment that also includes amounts attributable to one or more non-Federal candidates, and that is made by a political committee with separate Federal and non-Federal accounts, shall be made according to the procedures set forth in 11 CFR 106.6(e) or 106.7(f), but shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a) or 104.17(a). If a State, district, or local party committee's payment on behalf of both a Federal candidate and a non-Federal candidate is for a Federal election activity, only Federal funds may be used for the entire payment. For Federal election activities, the provisions of 11 CFR 300.33 and 104.17(a) will apply to payments attributable to candidates.</P>

            <P>(b) An authorized expenditure made by a candidate or political committee on behalf of another candidate shall be reported as a contribution in-kind (transfer) to the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, except that expenditures made by party committees pursuant to § 109.32 or 109.33 need only be reported as an expenditure.<PRTPAGE P="127"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions:</E> (1) Expenditures for rent, personnel, overhead, general administrative, fund-raising, and other day-to-day costs of political committees need not be attributed to individual candidates, unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.</P>
            <P>(2) Expenditures for educational campaign seminars, for training of campaign workers, and for registration or get-out-the-vote drives of committees need not be attributed to individual candidates unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate, and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.</P>
            <P>(3) Payments made for the cost of certain voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities conducted by State or local party organizations on behalf of any Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate(s) are exempt from the definition of a contribution or an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.89 and 100.149. If the State or local party organization includes references to any candidate(s) seeking nomination or election to the House of Representatives or Senate of the United States the portion of the cost of such activities allocable to such candidate(s) shall be considered a contribution to or an expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s), unless such reference is incidental to the overall activity. If such reference is incidental to the overall activity, such costs shall not be considered a contribution to or expenditure on behalf of any candidate(s).</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of this section, <E T="03">clearly identified</E> shall have the same meaning as set forth at 11 CFR 100.17.</P>
            <P>(e) State, district, and local party committees, separate segregated funds, and nonconnected committees that make mixed Federal/non-Federal payments for activities other than an activity entailing an expenditure for a Federal candidate and disbursement for a non-Federal candidate, or that make mixed Federal/Levin fund payments, shall allocate those expenses in accordance with 11 CFR 106.6, 106.7, or 300.33, as appropriate.</P>

In the event that the Commission disputes the candidate's allocation or claim of exemption for a particular expense, the candidate shall demonstrate, with supporting documentation, that his or her proposed method of allocation or claim of exemption was reasonable. Expenditures required to be allocated to the primary election under 11 CFR 9034.4(e) shall also be allocated to particular states in accordance with this section.</P>

            <P>(2) Disbursements made prior to the time an individual becomes a candidate for the purpose of determining whether that individual should become a candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 100.72(a) and 100.131(a), <E T="03">i.e.</E>, payments for testing the waters, shall be allocable expenditures under this section if the individual becomes a candidate.</P>

The total <PRTPAGE P="128"/>amount allocated to a particular State may be reduced by the amount of exempt fundraising expenses for that State, as specified in 11 CFR 110.8(c)(2).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific allocation methods.</E> Expenditures that fall within the categories listed below shall be allocated based on the following methods. The method used to allocate a category of expenditures shall be based on consistent data for each State to which an allocation is made.</P>

For purposes of this section, allocation to a particular State will not be required if less than 3% of the total estimated readership of the publication is in that State.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Broadcast media.</E> Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), expenditures for radio, television and similar types of advertisements purchased in a particular media market that covers more than one State shall be allocated to each State in proportion to the estimated audience.

            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Overhead expenditures</E>—(A) <E T="03">Overhead expenditures of State offices and other facilities.</E> Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead expenditures of committee offices whose activities are directed at a particular State, and the costs of other facilities used for office functions and campaign events, shall be allocated to that State. An amount that does not exceed 10% of office overhead expenditures for a particular State may be treated as exempt compliance expenses, and may be excluded from allocation to that State.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allocation of expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This section applies to allocation for expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel with respect to campaigns of candidates for Federal office, other than Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who receive federal funds pursuant to 11 CFR part 9005 or 9036. (See 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7) All expenditures for campaign-related travel paid for by a candidate from a campaign account or by his or her authorized committees or by any other political committee shall be reported.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Travel expenses paid for by a candidate from personal funds, or from a source other than a political committee, shall constitute reportable expenditures if the travel is campaign-related.</P>
            <P>(2) Where a candidate's trip involves both campaign-related and non-campaign-related stops, the expenditures allocable for campaign purposes are reportable, and are calculated on the actual cost-per-mile of the means of transportation actually used, starting at the point of origin of the trip, via every campaign-related stop and ending at the point of origin.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a candidate conducts any campaign-related activity in a stop, the stop is a campaign-related stop and travel expenditures made are reportable. Campaign-related activity shall not include any incidental contacts.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Where an individual, other than a candidate, conducts campaign-related activities on a trip, the portion of the trip attributed to each candidate shall be allocated on a reasonable basis.</P>
            <P>(2) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family are reportable as expenditures only if the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities.</P>
            <P>(d) Costs incurred by a candidate for the United States Senate or House of Representatives for travel between Washington, DC, and the State or district in which he or she is a candidate need not be reported herein unless the costs are paid by a candidate's authorized committee(s), or by any other political committee(s).</P>
            <P>(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the reportable expenditure for a candidate who uses government accommodations for travel that is campaign-related is the rate for comparable accommodations. The reportable expenditure for a candidate who uses a government conveyance for travel that is campaign-related is the applicable rate for a comparable commercial conveyance set forth in 11 CFR 100.93(e). In the case of a candidate authorized by law or required by national security to be accompanied by staff and equipment, the allocable expenditures are the costs of facilities sufficient to accommodate the party, less authorized or required personnel and equipment. If such a trip includes both campaign and noncampaign stops, equivalent costs are calculated in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) The purchase of opinion poll results by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee or agent is an expenditure by the candidate. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.131(a).</P>

            <P>(b) The purchase of opinion poll results by a political committee or other person not authorized by a candidate to make expenditures and the subsequent acceptance of the poll results by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee or agent or by another unauthorized political committee is a contribution in-kind by the purchaser to the candidate or other political committee and an expenditure <PRTPAGE P="131"/>by the candidate or other political committee. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.72(a). The poll results are accepted by a candidate or other political committee if the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee or agent or the other unauthorized political committee—</P>

            <P>(d) The purchase of opinion poll results by an unauthorized political committee for its own use, in whole or in part, is an overhead expenditure by the political committee under § 106.1(c)(1) to the extent of the benefit derived by the committee.</P>
            <P>(e) The amount of a contribution under paragraph (b) of this section or of any expenditure under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section attributable to each candidate-recipient or political committee-recipient shall be—</P>
            <P>(1) That share of the overall cost of the poll which is allocable to each candidate (including State and local candidates) or political committee, based upon the cost allocation formula of the polling firm from which the results are purchased. Under this method the size of the sample, the number of computer column codes, the extent of computer tabulations, and the extent of written analysis and verbal consultation, if applicable, may be used to determine the shares; or</P>
            <P>(2) An amount computed by dividing the overall cost of the poll equally among candidates (including State and local candidates) or political committees receiving the results; or</P>
            <P>(3) A proportion of the overall cost of the poll equal to the proportion that the number of question results received by the candidate or political committee bears to the total number of question results received by all candidates (including State and local candidates) and political committees; or</P>
            <P>(4) An amount computed by any other method which reasonably reflects the benefit derived.</P>
            <P>(f) The first candidate(s) or committee(s) receiving poll results under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and any candidate or political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this section within 15 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s) shall compute the amount of the contribution in-kind and the expenditure as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) The amount of the contribution and expenditure reported by a candidate or a political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this section more than 15 days after receipt of such poll results by the initial recipient(s) shall be—</P>
            <P>(1) If the results are received during the period 16 to 60 days following receipt by the initial recipient(s), 50 percent of the amount allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;</P>
            <P>(2) If the results are received during the period 61 to 180 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s), 5 percent of the amount allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;</P>
            <P>(3) If the results are received more than 180 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s), no amount need be allocated.</P>
            <P>(h) A contributor of poll results under paragraph (b) of this section shall maintain records sufficient to support the valuation of the contribution(s) in-kind and shall inform the candidate-recipient(s) or political committee-recipient(s) of the value of the contribution(s).</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">National party committees other than Senate or House campaign committees; fixed percentages for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Each national party committee other than a Senate or House campaign committee shall allocate a fixed percentage of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to its Federal and non-Federal account(s) each year. These percentages shall differ according to whether or not the allocable expenses were incurred in a presidential election year.

            <P>(i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the ratio of Federal expenditures to total Federal and non-Federal disbursements made by the committee during the two-year Federal election cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of each Federal election cycle, based upon the committee's Federal and non-Federal disbursements in a prior comparable Federal election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its Federal expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates. Calculation of total Federal and non-Federal disbursements shall also be limited to disbursements for specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or other generic costs.</P>
            <P>(ii) On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual Federal and non-Federal disbursements made, to date.

If the committee's own allocation calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a Federal share greater than 65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied. If such calculation yields a Federal share lower than 65%, then the committee shall report its calculated ratio according to 11 CFR 104.10(b), and shall apply the required minimum Federal percentage.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allocation of expenses between Federal and non-Federal accounts by party committees, other than for Federal election activities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) National party committees are prohibited from raising or spending non-Federal funds. Therefore, these committees shall not allocate expenditures and disbursements between Federal and non-Federal accounts. All disbursements by a national party committee must be made from a Federal account.</P>
            <P>(b) State, district, and local party committees that make expenditures and disbursements in connection with both Federal and non-Federal elections for activities that are not Federal election activities pursuant to 11 CFR 100.24 may use only funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, or they may allocate such expenditures and disbursements between their Federal and their non-Federal accounts. State, district, and local party committees that are political committees that have established separate Federal and non-Federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(i) shall allocate expenses between those accounts according to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Party organizations that are not political committees but have established separate Federal and non-Federal accounts, or that make Federal and non-Federal disbursements from a single account, shall also allocate their Federal and non-Federal expenses according to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. In lieu of establishing separate accounts, party organizations that are not political committees may choose to use a reasonable accounting method approved by the Commission (including any method embedded in software provided or approved by the Commission) pursuant to 11 CFR 102.5 and 300.30.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Costs allocable by State, district, and local party committees between Federal and non-Federal accounts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits.</E> State, district, and local party committees must either pay salaries, wages, and fringe benefits for employees who spend 25% or less of their time in a given month on Federal election activity or activity in connection with a Federal election with funds from their Federal account, or with a combination of funds from their Federal and non-Federal accounts, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 300.33(d)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> State, district, and local party committees may either pay administrative costs, including rent, utilities, office equipment, office supplies, postage for other than mass mailings, and routine building maintenance, upkeep and repair, from their Federal account, or allocate such expenses between their Federal and <PRTPAGE P="138"/>non-Federal accounts, except that any such expenses directly attributable to a clearly identified Federal candidate must be paid only from the Federal account.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exempt party activities that are not Federal election activities.</E> State, district, and local party committees may pay expenses for party activities that are exempt from the definitions of contribution and expenditure under 11 CFR 100.80, 100.87 or 100.89, and 100.140, 100.147 or 100.149, that are conducted in conjunction with non-Federal activity, and that are not Federal election activities pursuant to 11 CFR 100.24, from their Federal accounts, or may allocate these expenses between their Federal and non-Federal accounts.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Certain fundraising costs.</E> State, district, and local party committees may allocate the direct costs of joint fundraising programs or events between their Federal and non-Federal accounts according to the funds received method described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The direct costs of a fundraising program or event include expenses for the solicitation of funds and for the planning and administration of actual fundraising programs and events.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Voter-drive activities that do not qualify as Federal election activities and that are not party exempt activities.</E> Expenses for voter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, and any other activities that urge the general public to register or vote, or that promote or oppose a political party, without promoting or opposing a candidate or non-Federal candidate, that do not qualify as Federal election activities and that are not exempt party activities, must be paid with Federal funds or may be allocated between the committee's Federal and non-Federal accounts.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation percentages, ratios, and record-keeping</E>—(1) <E T="03">Salaries and wages.</E> Committees must keep a monthly log of the percentage of time each employee spends in connection with a Federal election. Allocations of salaries and wages shall be undertaken as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, salaries, wages, and fringe benefits paid for employees who spend 25% or less of their compensated time in a given month on Federal election activities or on activities in connection with a Federal election must either be paid only from the Federal account or be allocated as administrative costs under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>

            <P>(ii) Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits paid for employees who spend more than 25% of their compensated time in a given month on Federal election activities or on activities in connection with a Federal election must be paid only from a Federal account. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 300.33(d)(2), and paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) Salaries, wages, and fringe benefits paid for employees who spend none of their compensated time in a given month on Federal election activities or on activities in connection with a Federal election may be paid entirely with funds that comply with State law.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> State, district, and local party committees that choose to allocate administrative expenses may do so subject to the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Presidential election years.</E> In any even year in which a Presidential candidate, but no Senate candidate appears on the ballot, and in the preceding year, State, district, and local party committees must allocate at least 28% of administrative expenses to their Federal accounts.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Presidential and Senate election year.</E> In any even year in which a Presidential candidate and a Senate candidate appear on the ballot, and in the preceding year, State, district, and local party committees must allocate at least 36% of administrative expenses to their Federal accounts.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Senate election year.</E> In any even year in which a Senate candidate, but no Presidential candidate, appears on the ballot, and in the preceding year, State, district, and local party committees must allocate at least 21% of administrative expenses to their Federal account.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Non-Presidential and non-Senate year.</E> In any even year in which neither a Presidential nor a Senate candidate appears on the ballot, and in the preceding year, State, district, and local party committees must allocate at <PRTPAGE P="139"/>least 15% of administrative expenses to their Federal account.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exempt party activities and voter drive activities that are not Federal election activities.</E> State, district, and local party committees that choose to allocate expenses for exempt activities conducted in conjunction with non-Federal activities and voter drive activities, that are not Federal election activities, must do so subject to the following requirements:</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Fundraising for Federal and non-Federal accounts.</E> If Federal and non-Federal funds are collected by a State, district, or local party committee through a joint fundraising activity, that committee must allocate its direct fundraising costs using the funds received method and according to the following procedures:</P>
            <P>(i) The committee must allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its Federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its Federal and non-Federal revenue from that program or event, and must be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event must be allocated according to this estimated ratio.</P>
            <P>(ii) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both Federal and non-Federal funds are collected, the committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-Federal to its Federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event that serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the date for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Costs not allocable by State, district, and local party committees between Federal and non-Federal accounts.</E> The following costs incurred by State, district, and local party committees shall be paid only with Federal funds:</P>
            <P>(1) Disbursements for State, district, and local party committees for activities that refer only to one or more candidates for Federal office must not be allocated. All such disbursements must be made from a Federal account.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Salaries and wages.</E> Salaries and wages for employees who spend more than 25% of their compensated time in <PRTPAGE P="140"/>a given month on activities in connection with a Federal election must not be allocated. All such disbursements must be made from a Federal account. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 300.33(d)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Federal election activities.</E> Activities that are Federal election activities pursuant to 11 CFR 100.24 must not be allocated between Federal and non-Federal accounts. Only Federal funds, or a mixture of Federal funds and Levin funds, as provided in 11 CFR 300.33, may be used.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfers between accounts to cover allocable expenses.</E> State, district, and local party committees may transfer funds from their non-Federal to their Federal accounts or to an allocation account solely to meet allocable expenses under this section and only pursuant to the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Payments from Federal accounts or from allocation accounts.</E> (i) State, district, and local party committees must pay the entire amount of an allocable expense from their Federal accounts and transfer funds from their non-Federal account to the Federal account solely to cover the non-Federal share of that allocable expense; or</P>
            <P>(ii) State, district, or local party committees may establish a separate allocation account into which funds from its Federal and non-Federal accounts may be deposited solely for the purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint Federal and non-Federal activities.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing.</E> (i) If a Federal or allocation account is used to make allocable expenditures and disbursements, State, district, and local party committees must transfer funds from their non-Federal to their Federal or allocation account to meet allocable expenses no more than 10 days before and no more than 60 days after the payments for which they are designated are made from a Federal or allocation account, except that transfers may be made more than 10 days before a payment is made from the Federal or allocation account if advance payment is required by the vendor(s) and if such payment is based on a reasonable estimate of the activity's final costs as determined by the committee and the vendor(s) involved.</P>
            <P>(ii) Any portion of a transfer from a committee's non-Federal account to its Federal or allocation account that does not meet the requirement of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall be presumed to be a loan or contribution from the non-Federal account to the Federal or allocation account, in violation of the Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How do political committees and other persons report independent expenditures?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Political committees, including political party committees, must report independent expenditures under 11 CFR 104.4.</P>
              <P>(b) Every person that is not a political committee and that makes independent expenditures aggregating in excess of $250 with respect to a given election in a calendar year shall file a verified statement or report on FEC Form 5 in accordance with 11 CFR 104.4(e) containing the information required by paragraph (e) of this section. Every person filing a report or statement under this section shall do so in accordance with the quarterly reporting schedule specified in 11 CFR 104.5(a)(1)(i) and (ii) and shall file a report or statement for any quarterly period during which any such independent expenditures that aggregate in excess of $250 are made and in any quarterly reporting period thereafter in which additional independent expenditures are made.</P>
              <P>(c) For each election in which a person who is not a political committee makes independent expenditures, the person shall aggregate its independent expenditures made in each calendar year to determine its reporting obligation. When such a person makes independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, the person must report the independent expenditures on FEC Form 5, or by signed statement if the person is not otherwise required to file electronically under 11 CFR 104.18. (See 11 CFR 104.4(f) for aggregation.) The person making the independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more must ensure that the Commission receives the report or statement by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which a communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $10,000 or more, the person making the independent expenditures must ensure that the Commission receives a new 48-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures. Each 48-hour report must contain the information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Every person making, after the 20th day, but more than 24 hours before 12:01 a.m. of the day of an election, independent expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more with respect to a given election must report those independent expenditures and ensure that the Commission receives the report or signed statement by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate $1,000 or more, the person making the independent expenditures must ensure that the Commission receives a new 24-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures. (See 11 CFR 104.4(f) for aggregation.) Such report or statement shall contain the information required by paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Content of verified reports and statements and verification of reports and statements.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Contents of verified reports and statement.</E> If a signed report or statement is submitted, the report or statement shall include:<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The reporting person's name, mailing address, occupation, and the name of his or her employer, if any;</P>
              <P>(ii) The identification (name and mailing address) of the person to whom the expenditure was made;</P>
              <P>(iii) The amount, date, and purpose of each expenditure;</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement that indicates whether such expenditure was in support of, or in opposition to a candidate, together with the candidate's name and office sought;</P>
              <P>(v) A verified certification under penalty of perjury as to whether such expenditure was made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents; and</P>
              <P>(vi) The identification of each person who made a contribution in excess of $200 to the person filing such report, which contribution was made for the purpose of furthering the reported independent expenditure.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Verification of independent expenditure statements and reports.</E> Every person shall verify reports and statements of independent expenditures filed pursuant to the requirements of this section by one of the methods stated in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. Any report or statement verified under either of these methods shall be treated for all purposes (including penalties for perjury) in the same manner as a document verified by signature.</P>
              <P>(i) For reports or statements filed on paper (e.g., by hand-delivery, U.S. Mail, or facsimile machine), the person who made the independent expenditure shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by handwritten signature immediately following the certification required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For reports or statements filed by electronic mail, the person who made the independent expenditure shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by typing the treasurer's name immediately following the certification required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section.</P>

              <P>(C) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated outside the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section that would apply to a communication containing only a reference to a political party applies.</P>
              <P>(5) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. For purposes of this section, a communication is the functional equivalent of express advocacy if it is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified Federal candidate.</P>

A discussion is substantial within the meaning of this paragraph if information about the candidate's or political party committee's campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs is conveyed to a person paying for the communication, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Common vendor.</E> All of the following statements in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iii) of this section are true:</P>

              <P>(I) Consulting or otherwise providing political or media advice; and</P>
              <P>(iii) This paragraph, (d)(4)(iii), is not satisfied if the information material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication used or conveyed by the commercial vendor was obtained from a publicly available source.

              <P>(5) <E T="03">Former employee or independent contractor.</E> Both of the following statements in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section are true:<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The communication is paid for by a person, or by the employer of a person, who was an employee or independent contractor of the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, during the previous 120 days; and</P>

              <P>(B) Information used by the former employee or independent contractor in providing services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Dissemination, distribution, or republication of campaign material.</E> A communication that satisfies the content standard of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or 11 CFR 109.37(a)(2)(i) shall only satisfy the conduct standards of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section on the basis of conduct by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee, or the agents of any of the foregoing, that occurs after the original preparation of the campaign materials that are disseminated, distributed, or republished. The conduct standards of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section may also apply to such communications as provided in those paragraphs.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement or formal collaboration.</E> Agreement or formal collaboration between the person paying for the communication and the candidate clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, is not required for a communication to be a coordinated communication. <E T="03">Agreement</E> means a mutual understanding or meeting of the minds on all or any part of the material aspects of the communication or its dissemination. <E T="03">Formal collaboration</E> means planned, or systematically organized, work on the communication.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Safe harbor for responses to inquiries about legislative or policy issues.</E> A candidate's or a political party committee's response to an inquiry about that candidate's or political party committee's positions on legislative or policy issues, but not including a discussion of campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs, does not satisfy any of the conduct standards in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Safe harbor for endorsements and solicitations by Federal candidates.</E> (1) A public communication in which a candidate for Federal office endorses another candidate for Federal or non-Federal office is not a coordinated communication with respect to the endorsing Federal candidate unless the public communication promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the endorsing candidate or another candidate who seeks election to the same office as the endorsing candidate.</P>
              <P>(2) A public communication in which a candidate for Federal office solicits funds for another candidate for Federal or non-Federal office, a political committee, or organizations as permitted by 11 CFR 300.65, is not a coordinated communication with respect to the soliciting Federal candidate unless the public communication promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the soliciting candidate or another candidate who seeks election to the same office as the soliciting candidate.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Safe harbor for establishment and use of a firewall.</E> The conduct standards in paragraph (d) of this section are not met if the commercial vendor, former employee, or political committee has established and implemented a firewall <PRTPAGE P="151"/>that meets the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section. This safe harbor provision does not apply if specific information indicates that, despite the firewall, information about the candidate's or political party committee's campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs that is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication was used or conveyed to the person paying for the communication.</P>
              <P>(1) The firewall must be designed and implemented to prohibit the flow of information between employees or consultants providing services for the person paying for the communication and those employees or consultants currently or previously providing services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee; and</P>
              <P>(2) The firewall must be described in a written policy that is distributed to all relevant employees, consultants, and clients affected by the policy.</P>

              <P>(1) The medium, timing, content, and geographic distribution of the public communication are consistent with public communications made prior to the candidacy; and</P>

              <P>The national committee of a political party must not make independent expenditures in connection with the general election campaign of a candidate for President of the United States if the national committee of that political party is designated as the authorized committee of its Presidential candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 9002.1(c).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is a “party coordinated communication”?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> A political party communication is coordinated with a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or agent of any of the foregoing, when the communication satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The communication is paid for by a political party committee or its agent.</P>
              <P>(2) The communication satisfies at least one of the content standards described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) A public communication that disseminates, distributes, or republishes, in whole or in part, campaign materials prepared by a candidate, the candidate's authorized committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing, unless the dissemination, distribution, or republication is excepted under 11 CFR 109.23(b). For a communication that satisfies this content standard, see 11 CFR 109.21(d)(6).</P>
              <P>(ii) A public communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.</P>
              <P>(iii) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that satisfies paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">References to House and Senate candidates.</E> The public communication refers to a clearly identified House or Senate candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction 90 days or fewer <PRTPAGE P="154"/>before the clearly identified candidate's general, special, or runoff election, or primary or preference election, or nominating convention or caucus.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">References to Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates.</E> The public communication refers to a clearly identified Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction during the period of time beginning 120 days before the clearly identified candidate's primary or preference election in that jurisdiction, or nominating convention or caucus in that jurisdiction, up to and including the day of the general election.</P>
              <P>(3) The communication satisfies at least one of the conduct standards in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(6), subject to the provisions of 11 CFR 109.21(e), (g), and (h). A candidate's response to an inquiry about that candidate's positions on legislative or policy issues, but not including a discussion of campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs, does not satisfy any of the conduct standards in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(6). Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the candidate with whom a party coordinated communication is coordinated does not receive or accept an in-kind contribution, and is not required to report an expenditure that results from conduct described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(4) or (d)(5), unless the candidate, authorized committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing, engages in conduct described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(3).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Treatment of a party coordinated communication.</E> A payment by a political party committee for a communication that is coordinated with a candidate, and that is not otherwise exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C or E, must be treated by the political party committee making the payment as either:</P>
              <P>(1) An in-kind contribution for the purpose of influencing a Federal election under 11 CFR 100.52(d) to the candidate with whom it was coordinated, which must be reported under 11 CFR part 104; or</P>
              <P>(2) A coordinated party expenditure pursuant to coordinated party expenditure authority under 11 CFR 109.32 in connection with the general election campaign of the candidate with whom it was coordinated, which must be reported under 11 CFR part 104.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to all contributions made by any person as defined in 11 CFR 100.10, except multicandidate political committees as defined in 11 CFR 100.5(e)(3) or entities <PRTPAGE P="155"/>and individuals prohibited from making contributions under 11 CFR 110.20 and 11 CFR parts 114 and 115.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Contributions to candidates; designations; and redesignations.</E> (1) No person shall make contributions to any candidate, his or her authorized political committees or agents with respect to any election for Federal office that, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000.</P>
            <P>(i) The contribution limitation in the introductory text of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be increased by the percent difference in the price index in accordance with 11 CFR 110.17.</P>
            <P>(ii) The increased contribution limitation shall be in effect for the 2-year period beginning on the first day following the date of the last general election in the year preceding the year in which the contribution limitation is increased and ending on the date of the next general election. For example, an increase in the contribution limitation made in January 2005 is effective from November 3, 2004 to November 7, 2006.</P>

            <P>(iii) In every odd numbered year, the Commission will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the amount of the contribution limitation in effect and place such information on the Commission's Web site.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this section, <E T="03">with respect to any election</E> means—</P>

            <P>(i) In the case of a contribution designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the election so designated. Contributors to candidates are encouraged to designate their contributions in writing for particular elections. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 110.1(b)(4).</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of a contribution not designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the next election for that Federal office after the contribution is made.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) A contribution designated in writing for a particular election, but made after that election, shall be made only to the extent that the contribution does not exceed net debts outstanding from such election. To the extent that such contribution exceeds net debts outstanding, the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee shall return or deposit the contribution within ten days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution as provided by 11 CFR 103.3(a), and if deposited, then within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt the treasurer shall take the following action, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(A) Refund the contribution using a committee check or draft; or</P>
            <P>(B) Obtain a written redesignation by the contributor for another election in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5); or</P>

            <P>(ii) In order to determine whether there are net debts outstanding from a particular election, the treasurer of the candidate's authorized political committee shall calculate net debts outstanding as of the date of the election. For purposes of this section, <E T="03">net debts outstanding</E> means the total amount of unpaid debts and obligations incurred with respect to an election, including the estimated cost of raising funds to liquidate debts incurred with respect to the election and, if the candidate's authorized committee terminates or if the candidate will not be a candidate for the next election, estimated necessary costs associated with termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post-election requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries and office supplies, less the sum of:</P>
            <P>(A) The total cash on hand available to pay those debts and obligations, including: currency; balances on deposit in banks, savings and loan institutions, and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any other committee investments valued at fair market value;</P>

            <P>(B) The total amounts owed to the candidate or political committee in the form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, or receivables, or a commercially reasonable amount based on the <PRTPAGE P="156"/>collectibility of those credits, refunds, returns, or receivables; and</P>
            <P>(C) The amount of personal loans, as defined in 11 CFR 116.11(b), that in the aggregate exceed $250,000 per election.</P>
            <P>(iii) The amount of the net debts outstanding shall be adjusted as additional funds are received and expenditures are made. The candidate and his or her authorized political committee(s) may accept contributions made after the date of the election if:</P>
            <P>(A) Such contributions are designated in writing by the contributor for that election;</P>
            <P>(B) Such contributions do not exceed the adjusted amount of net debts outstanding on the date the contribution is received; and</P>
            <P>(C) Such contributions do not exceed the contribution limitations in effect on the date of such election.</P>
            <P>(iv) This paragraph shall not be construed to prevent a candidate who is a candidate in the general election or his or her authorized political committee(s) from paying primary election debts and obligations with funds which represent contributions made with respect to the general election.</P>
            <P>(4) For purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be designated in writing for a particular election if—</P>
            <P>(i) The contribution is made by check, money order, or other negotiable instrument which clearly indicates the particular election with respect to which the contribution is made;</P>
            <P>(ii) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the contributor, which clearly indicates the particular election with respect to which the contribution is made; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The contribution is redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5).</P>
            <P>(5)(i) The treasurer of an authorized political committee may request a written redesignation of a contribution by the contributor for a different election if—</P>
            <P>(A) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution, either on its face or when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor for the same election, exceeds the limitation on contributions set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1);</P>
            <P>(B) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular election and the contribution was made after that election and the contribution cannot be accepted under the net debts outstanding provisions of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3);</P>
            <P>(C) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution exceeds the limitation on contributions set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1); or</P>
            <P>(D) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution was received after the date of an election for which there are net debts outstanding on the date the contribution is received.</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) A contribution shall be considered to be redesignated for another election if—</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee requests that the contributor provide a written redesignation of the contribution and informs the contributor that the contributor may request the refund of the contribution as an alternative to providing a written redesignation; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the contributor provides the treasurer with a written redesignation of the contribution for another election, which is signed by the contributor.</P>
            <P>(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section or any other provision of this section, the treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee may treat all or part of the amount of the contribution that exceeds the contribution limits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as made with respect to the general election, provided that:</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The contribution would exceed the limitation on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it were treated as a contribution made for the primary election;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Such redesignation would not cause the contributor to exceed any of <PRTPAGE P="157"/>the limitations on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee notifies the contributor of the amount of the contribution that was redesignated and that the contributor may request a refund of the contribution; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the treasurer shall provide notification required in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(5) of this section to the contributor by any written method including electronic mail.</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The contribution would exceed the limitation on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it were treated as a contribution made for the general election;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Such redesignation would not cause the contributor to exceed any of the limitations on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The contribution does not exceed the committee's net debts outstanding for the primary election;</P>

            <P>(iii) A contribution redesignated for another election shall not exceed the limitations on contributions made with respect to that election. A contribution redesignated for a previous election shall be subject to the requirements of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3) regarding net debts outstanding.</P>

            <P>(6) For the purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be made when the contributor relinquishes control over the contribution. A contributor shall be considered to relinquish control over the contribution when it is delivered by the contributor to the candidate, to the political committee, or to an agent of the political committee. A contribution that is mailed to the candidate, or to the political committee or to an agent of the political committee, shall be considered to be made on the date of the postmark. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 110.1(l)(4).

See 11 CFR 102.2(a)(3) for multicandidate political committee certification requirements. A political committee becomes a multicandidate committee at the time the political committee meets the requirements of 11 CFR 100.5(e)(3) or becomes affiliated with an existing multicandidate committee, whether or not the political committee has certified its status as a multicandidate <PRTPAGE P="161"/>committee with the Commission in accordance with 11 CFR 102.2(a)(3).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to recipients.</E> Each multicandidate committee that makes a contribution under this section shall notify the recipient in writing of its status as a multicandidate committee.</P>

            <P>(A) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee requests that the contributor provide a written redesignation of the contribution and informs the contributor that the contributor may request the refund of the contribution as an alternative to providing a written redesignation; and</P>

            <P>(4) All electioneering communications by any person.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General content requirements.</E> A disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section must contain the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) If the communication, including any solicitation, is paid for and authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of either of the foregoing, the disclaimer must clearly state that the communication has been paid for by the authorized political committee;</P>
            <P>(2) If the communication, including any solicitation, is authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of either of the foregoing, but is paid for by any other person, the disclaimer must clearly state that the communication is paid for by such other person and is authorized by such candidate, authorized committee, or agent; or</P>
            <P>(3) If the communication, including any solicitation, is not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of either of the foregoing, the disclaimer must clearly state the full name and permanent street address, telephone number, or World Wide Web address of the person who paid for the communication, and that the communication is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Disclaimer specifications</E>—(1) <E T="03">Specifications for all disclaimers.</E> A disclaimer <PRTPAGE P="172"/>required by paragraph (a) of this section must be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, to give the reader, observer, or listener adequate notice of the identity of the person or political committee that paid for and, where required, that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and conspicuous if it is difficult to read or hear, or if the placement is easily overlooked.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific requirements for printed communications.</E> In addition to the general requirement of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section that appears on any printed public communication must comply with all of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The disclaimer must be of sufficient type size to be clearly readable by the recipient of the communication. A disclaimer in twelve (12)-point type size satisfies the size requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(i) when it is used for signs, posters, flyers, newspapers, magazines, or other printed material that measure no more than twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches.</P>
            <P>(ii) The disclaimer must be contained in a printed box set apart from the other contents of the communication.</P>
            <P>(iii) The disclaimer must be printed with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the printed statement. A disclaimer satisfies the color contrast requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) if it is printed in black text on a white background or if the degree of color contrast between the background and the text of the disclaimer is no less than the color contrast between the background and the largest text used in the communication.</P>
            <P>(iv) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the communication as long as it appears within the communication, except on communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face.</P>
            <P>(v) A communication that would require a disclaimer if distributed separately, that is included in a package of materials, must contain the required disclaimer.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Specific requirements for radio and television communications authorized by candidates.</E> In addition to the general requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a communication that is authorized or paid for by a candidate or the authorized committee of a candidate (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section) that is transmitted through radio or television, or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must comply with the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A communication transmitted through radio must include an audio statement by the candidate that identifies the candidate and states that he or she has approved the communication; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A communication transmitted through television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must include a statement that identifies the candidate and states that he or she has approved the communication. The candidate shall convey the statement either:</P>
            <P>(A) Through an unobscured, full-screen view of himself or herself making the statement, or</P>
            <P>(B) Through a voice-over by himself or herself, accompanied by a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate. A photographic or similar image of the candidate shall be considered clearly identified if it is at least eighty (80) percent of the vertical screen height.</P>
            <P>(iii) A communication transmitted through television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must also include a similar statement that must appear in clearly readable writing at the end of the television communication. To be clearly readable, this statement must meet all of the following three requirements:</P>
            <P>(A) The statement must appear in letters equal to or greater than four (4) percent of the vertical picture height;</P>
            <P>(B) The statement must be visible for a period of at least four (4) seconds; and</P>

            <P>(C) The statement must appear with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the text of the statement. A statement satisfies the color contrast requirement of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) if it is printed in black text on a white background or if the degree of color contrast between the background and the text of the <PRTPAGE P="173"/>statement is no less than the color contrast between the background and the largest type size used in the communication.</P>
            <P>(iv) The following are examples of acceptable statements that satisfy the spoken statement requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section with respect to a radio, television, or other broadcast, cable, or satellite communication, but they are not the only allowable statements:</P>
            <P>(A) “I am [insert name of candidate], a candidate for [insert Federal office sought], and I approved this advertisement.”</P>
            <P>(B) “My name is [insert name of candidate]. I am running for [insert Federal office sought], and I approved this message.”</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Specific requirements for radio and television communications paid for by other persons and not authorized by a candidate.</E> In addition to the general requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a communication not authorized by a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee that is transmitted through radio or television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must comply with the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A communication transmitted through radio or television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must include the following audio statement, “XXX is responsible for the content of this advertising,” spoken clearly, with the blank to be filled in with the name of the political committee or other person paying for the communication, and the name of the connected organization, if any, of the payor unless the name of the connected organization is already provided in the “XXX is responsible” statement; and</P>
            <P>(ii) A communication transmitted through television, or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must include the audio statement required by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. That statement must be conveyed by an unobscured full-screen view of a representative of the political committee or other person making the statement, or by a representative of such political committee or other person in voice-over.</P>
            <P>(iii) A communication transmitted through television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must also include a similar statement that must appear in clearly readable writing at the end of the communication. To be clearly readable, the statement must meet all of the following three requirements:</P>
            <P>(A) The statement must appear in letters equal to or greater than four (4) percent of the vertical picture height;</P>
            <P>(B) The statement must be visible for a period of at least four (4) seconds; and</P>
            <P>(C) The statement must appear with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the disclaimer statement. A disclaimer satisfies the color contrast requirement of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C) if it is printed in black text on a white background or if the degree of color contrast between the background and the text of the disclaimer is no less than the color contrast between the background and the largest type size used in the communication.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordinated party expenditures and independent expenditures by political party committees.</E> (1)(i) For a communication paid for by a political party committee pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30116(d), the disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section must identify the political party committee that makes the expenditure as the person who paid for the communication, regardless of whether the political party committee was acting in its own capacity or as the designated agent of another political party committee.</P>
            <P>(ii) A communication made by a political party committee pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30116(d) and distributed prior to the date the party's candidate is nominated shall satisfy the requirements of this section if it clearly states who paid for the communication.</P>

            <P>(2) For purposes of this section, a communication paid for by a political party committee, other than a communication covered by paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, that is being treated as a coordinated expenditure under 52 U.S.C. 30116(d) and that was made with the approval of a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or the <PRTPAGE P="174"/>agent of either shall identify the political party that paid for the communication and shall state that the communication is authorized by the candidate or candidate's authorized committee.</P>
            <P>(3) For a communication paid for by a political party committee that constitutes an independent expenditure under 11 CFR 100.16, the disclaimer required by this section must identify the political party committee that paid for the communication, and must state that the communication is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's authorized committee.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exempt activities.</E> A public communication authorized by a candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee, that qualifies as an exempt activity under 11 CFR 100.140, 100.147, 100.148, or 100.149, must comply with the disclaimer requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of this section, unless excepted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but the disclaimer does not need to state whether the communication is authorized by a candidate, or any authorized committee or agent of any candidate.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (1) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section do not apply to the following:</P>

            <P>(iii) Checks, receipts, and similar items of minimal value that are used for purely administrative purposes and do not contain a political message.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this section, whenever a separate segregated fund or its connected organization solicits contributions to the fund from those persons it may solicit under the applicable provisions of 11 CFR part 114, or makes a communication to those persons, such communication shall not be considered a type of public communication and need not contain the disclaimer required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Comparable rate for campaign purposes.</E> (1) No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of the candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination or for election, shall charge an amount for the space which exceeds the comparable rate for the space for non-campaign purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposed of this section, comparable rate means the rate charged to a national or general rate advertiser, and shall include discount privileges usually and normally available to a national or general rate advertiser.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What will the Commission do once it receives the respondent's written response and the reviewing officer's recommendation?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the Commission, after having found reason to believe and after reviewing the respondent's written response and the reviewing officer's recommendation, determines by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) of its members, that the respondent has violated 52 U.S.C. 30104(a) and the amount of the civil money penalty, the Commission shall authorize the reviewing officer to notify the respondent by letter of its final determination.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Commission, after reviewing the reason to believe finding, the respondent's written response, and the reviewing officer's written recommendation, determines by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) of its members, that no violation has occurred (either because the Commission had based its reason to believe finding on a factual error or because the respondent used best efforts to file in a timely manner) or otherwise terminates its proceedings, the Commission shall authorize the reviewing officer to notify the respondent by letter of its final determination.</P>
              <P>(c) The Commission will modify the proposed civil money penalty only if the respondent is able to demonstrate that the amount of the proposed civil money penalty was calculated on an incorrect basis.</P>
              <P>(d) When the Commission makes a final determination under this section, the statement of reasons for the Commission action will, unless otherwise indicated by the Commission, consist of the reasons provided by the reviewing officer for the recommendation, if approved by the Commission, although statements setting forth additional or different reasons may also be issued. If the reviewing officer's recommendation is modified or not approved, the Commission will indicate the grounds for its action and one or more statements of reasons may be issued.</P>

              <P>(b) If the respondent submits a written petition to the district court of the United States and, upon the final disposition of the civil action, is required to pay a civil money penalty, the respondent shall remit payment of the civil money penalty to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the final disposition of the civil action. The final disposition may consist of a judicial decision which is not reviewed by a higher court.</P>

              <P>(c) Failure to pay the civil money penalty may result in the commencement of collection action under 31 U.S.C. 3701 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (1996), or a civil suit pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(6)(A), or any other legal action deemed necessary by the Commission.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions (52 U.S.C. 30114).</SUBJECT>
            <P>When used in this part—</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Funds donated. Funds donated</E> means all funds, including, but not limited to, gifts, loans, advances, credits or deposits of money which are donated for the purpose of supporting the activities of a Federal or State officeholder; but does not mean funds appropriated by Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or personal funds of the officeholder donated to an account containing only those personal funds.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Office account.</E> Office account means an account established for the purposes of supporting the activities of a Federal or State officeholder which contains campaign funds and funds donated, but does not include an account used exclusively for funds appropriated by Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or an account of the officeholder which contains only the personal funds of the officeholder.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal officeholder. Federal officeholder</E> means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or <PRTPAGE P="200"/>a Senator or a Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">State officeholder. State officeholder</E> means an individual elected to or serving in any elected public office within a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any subdivision thereof.</P>
            <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Qualified Member. Qualified Member</E> means an individual who was serving as a Senator or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, Congress, on January 8, 1980.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Personal use. Personal use</E> means any use of funds in a campaign account of a present or former candidate to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder.</P>
            <P>(1)(i) Personal use includes but is not limited to the use of funds in a campaign account for any item listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)(A) through (J) of this section:</P>
            <P>(A) Household food items or supplies.</P>
            <P>(B) Funeral, cremation or burial expenses except those incurred for a candidate (as defined in 11 CFR 100.3) or an employee or volunteer of an authorized committee whose death arises out of, or in the course of, campaign activity.</P>
            <P>(C) Clothing, other than items of <E T="03">de minimis</E> value that are used in the campaign, such as campaign “T-shirts” or caps with campaign slogans.</P>
            <P>(D) Tuition payments, other than those associated with training campaign staff.</P>
            <P>(E) Mortgage, rent or utility payments—</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For any part of any personal residence of the candidate or a member of the candidate's family; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For real or personal property that is owned by the candidate or a member of the candidate's family and used for campaign purposes, to the extent the payments exceed the fair market value of the property usage.</P>
            <P>(F) Admission to a sporting event, concert, theater or other form of entertainment, unless part of a specific campaign or officeholder activity.</P>
            <P>(G) Dues, fees or gratuities at a country club, health club, recreational facility or other nonpolitical organization, unless they are part of the costs of a specific fundraising event that takes place on the organization's premises.</P>

            <P>(H) Salary payments to a member of the candidate's family, unless the family member is providing <E T="03">bona fide</E> services to the campaign. If a family member provides <E T="03">bona fide</E> services to the campaign, any salary payment in excess of the fair market value of the services provided is personal use.</P>

            <P>(I) Salary payments by a candidate's principal campaign to a candidate in excess of the lesser of: the minimum salary paid to a Federal officeholder holding the Federal office that the candidate seeks; or the earned income that the candidate received during the year prior to becoming a candidate. Any earned income that a candidate receives from salaries or wages from any other source shall count against the foregoing limit of the minimum salary paid to a Federal officeholder holding the Federal office that the candidate seeks. The candidate must provide income tax records from the relevant years and other evidence of earned income upon the request of the Commission. Salary shall not be paid to a candidate before the filing deadline for access to the primary election ballot for the Federal office that the candidate seeks, as determined by State law, or in those states that do not conduct primaries, on January 1 of each even-numbered year. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.24(a)(1)(i). If the candidate wins the primary election, his or her principal campaign committee may pay him or her a salary from campaign funds through the date of the general election, up to and including the date of any general election runoff. If the candidate loses the primary, withdraws from the race, or otherwise ceases to be a candidate, no salary payments may be paid beyond the date he or she is no longer a candidate. In odd-numbered years in which a special election for a Federal office occurs, the principal campaign committee of a candidate for that office may pay him or her a salary from campaign funds starting on the date the special election is set and ending on the day of the special election. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.24(a)(1)(ii). During the <PRTPAGE P="201"/>time period in which a principal campaign committee may pay a salary to a candidate under this paragraph, such payment must be computed on a pro-rata basis. A Federal officeholder, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, must not receive salary payments as a candidate from campaign funds.</P>
            <P>(J) A vacation.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Commission will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether other uses of funds in a campaign account fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense that would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder, and therefore are personal use. Examples of such other uses include:</P>
            <P>(A) Legal expenses;</P>
            <P>(B) Meal expenses;</P>
            <P>(C) Travel expenses, including subsistence expenses incurred during travel. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with travel that involves both personal activities and campaign or officeholder-related activities, the incremental expenses that result from the personal activities are personal use, unless the person(s) benefiting from this use reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty days for the amount of the incremental expenses, and</P>
            <P>(D) Vehicle expenses, unless they are a <E T="03">de minimis</E> amount. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with a vehicle that is used for both personal activities beyond a <E T="03">de minimis</E> amount and campaign or officeholder-related activities, the portion of the vehicle expenses associated with the personal activities is personal use, unless the person(s) using the vehicle for personal activities reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty days for the expenses associated with the personal activities.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Charitable donations.</E> Donations of campaign funds or assets to an organization described in section 170(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code are not personal use, unless the candidate receives compensation from the organization before the organization has expended the entire amount donated for purposes unrelated to his or her personal benefit.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Transfers of campaign assets.</E> The transfer of a campaign committee asset is not personal use so long as the transfer is for fair market value. Any depreciation that takes place before the transfer must be allocated between the committee and the purchaser based on the useful life of the asset.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Gifts.</E> Gifts of nominal value and donations of a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as a holiday, graduation, marriage, retirement, or death are not personal use, unless made to a member of the candidate's family.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Political or officially connected expenses.</E> The use of campaign funds for an expense that would be a political expense under the rules of the United States House of Representatives or an officially connected expense under the rules of the United States Senate is not personal use to the extent that the expense is an expenditure under subpart D of part 100 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office. Any use of funds that would be personal use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not be considered an expenditure under subpart D of part 100 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Third party payments.</E> Notwithstanding that the use of funds for a particular expense would be a personal use under this section, payment of that expense by any person other than the candidate or the campaign committee shall be a contribution under subpart B of part 100 to the candidate unless the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy. Examples of payments considered to be irrespective of the candidacy include, but are not limited to, situations where—</P>
            <P>(i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund established in accordance with the rules of the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives;</P>
            <P>(ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 100.33, including an account jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family;</P>

            <P>(iii) Payments for that expense were made by the person making the payment before the candidate became a <PRTPAGE P="202"/>candidate. Payments that are compensation shall be considered contributions unless—</P>
            <P>(A) The compensation results from <E T="03">bona fide</E> employment that is genuinely independent of the candidacy;</P>
            <P>(B) The compensation is exclusively in consideration of services provided by the employee as part of this employment; and</P>
            <P>(C) The compensation does not exceed the amount of compensation which would be paid to any other similarly qualified person for the same work over the same period of time.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Members of the candidate's family.</E> For the purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the candidate's family includes:</P>
            <P>(i) The spouse of the candidate;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any child, step-child, parent, grandparent, sibling, half-sibling or step-sibling of the candidate or the candidate's spouse;</P>
            <P>(iii) The spouse of any child, step-child, parent, grandparent, sibling, half-sibling or step-sibling of the candidate; and</P>
            <P>(iv) A person who shares a residence with the candidate.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> For those uses of campaign funds described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this section that involve both personal use and either campaign or office-holder use, a contemporaneous log or other record must be kept to document the dates and expenses related to the personal use of the campaign funds. The log must be updated whenever campaign funds are used for personal expenses, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, rather than for campaign or office-holder expenses. The log or other record must also be maintained and preserved for 3 years after the report disclosing the disbursement is filed, pursuant to 11 CFR 102.9 and 104.14(b).</P>

            <P>(1) Such national banks and corporations may engage in the activities permitted by 11 CFR part 114, except to the extent that such activity constitutes a contribution, expenditure, or electioneering communication or is foreclosed by provisions of law other than the Act.</P>

Supp. 2d 121 (D.D.C. 2011), corporations and labor organizations may make contributions to nonconnected political committees that make only independent expenditures, or to separate accounts maintained by nonconnected political committees for making only independent expenditures, notwithstanding 11 CFR 114.2(b) and 11 CFR 114.10(a). The Commission has not conducted a rulemaking in response to these cases.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>(c) Disbursements by corporations and labor organizations for the election-related activities described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 will not cause those activities to be contributions when coordinated with any candidate, candidate's agent, candidate's authorized committee(s) or any party committee to the extent permitted in those sections. Coordination beyond that described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 shall not cause subsequent activities directed at the restricted class to be considered contributions. However, such coordination may be considered evidence that could negate the independence of subsequent communications to those outside the restricted class by the corporation, labor organization or its separate segregated fund, and could result in an in-kind contribution. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.16 regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.<PRTPAGE P="208"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) A candidate, political committee, or other person is prohibited from knowingly accepting or receiving any contribution prohibited by this section.</P>
            <P>(e) No officer or director of any corporation or any national bank, and no officer of any labor organization shall consent to any contribution or expenditure by the corporation, national bank, or labor organization prohibited by this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Facilitating the making of contributions.</E> (1) Corporations and labor organizations (including officers, directors or other representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election, such as activities which go beyond the limited exemptions set forth in 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C, part 100, subparts D and E, 114.9(a) through (c) and 114.13. A corporation does not facilitate the making of a contribution to a candidate or political committee if it provides goods or services in the ordinary course of its business as a commercial vendor in accordance with 11 CFR part 116 at the usual and normal charge.</P>
            <P>(2) Examples of facilitating the making of contributions include but are not limited to—</P>
            <P>(i) Fundraising activities by corporations (except commercial vendors) or labor organizations that involve—</P>
            <P>(A) Officials or employees of the corporation or labor organization ordering or directing subordinates or support staff (who therefore are not acting as volunteers) to plan, organize or carry out the fundraising project as a part of their work responsibilities using corporate or labor organization resources, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of such services;</P>
            <P>(B) Failure to reimburse a corporation or labor organization within a commercially reasonable time for the use of corporate facilities described in 11 CFR 114.9(d) in connection with such fundraising activities;</P>
            <P>(C) Using a corporate or labor organization list of customers, clients, vendors or others who are not in the restricted class to solicit contributions or distribute invitations to the fundraiser, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the list;</P>
            <P>(D) Using meeting rooms that are not customarily made available to clubs, civic or community organizations or other groups; or</P>
            <P>(E) Providing catering or other food services operated or obtained by the corporation or labor organization, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the services;</P>
            <P>(ii) Providing materials for the purpose of transmitting or delivering contributions, such as stamps, envelopes addressed to a candidate or political committee other than the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, or other similar items which would assist in transmitting or delivering contributions, but not including providing the address of the candidate or political committee;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disbursements for communications to the restricted class in connection with a Federal election.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Corporations and labor organizations may make communications on any subject, including communications containing express advocacy, to their restricted class or any part of that class. Corporations and labor organizations may also make the communications permitted under 11 CFR 114.4 to their restricted class or any part of that class. The activities permitted under this section may involve election-related coordination with candidates and political committees. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 100.16 and 114.2(c) regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.</P>
            <P>(2) Incorporated membership organizations, incorporated trade associations, incorporated cooperatives and corporations without capital stock may make communications to their restricted class, or any part of that class as permitted in paragraphs (a)(1) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting communications containing express advocacy to the restricted class.</E> Disbursements for communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) made by a corporation, including a corporation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or labor organization to its restricted class shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a) and 104.6.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Communications containing express advocacy.</E> Communications containing express advocacy which may be made to the restricted class include, but are not limited to, the examples set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Publications.</E> Printed material expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates of a clearly identified political party may be distributed by a corporation or by a labor organization to its restricted class, provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) The material is produced at the expense of the corporation or labor organization; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The material constitutes a communication of the views of the corporation or the labor organization, and is not the republication or reproduction, in whole or in part, of any broadcast, transcript or tape or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by the candidate, his or her campaign committees, or their authorized agents. A corporation or labor organization may, under this section, use brief quotations from speeches or other materials of a candidate that demonstrate the candidate's position as part of the corporation's or <PRTPAGE P="210"/>labor organization's expression of its own views.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Candidate and party appearances.</E> (i) A corporation may allow a candidate, candidate's representative or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention or other function of the corporation, but is not required to do so. A labor organization may allow a candidate or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention, or other function of the labor organization, but is not required to do so. A corporation or labor organization may bar other candidates for the same office or a different office and their representatives, and representatives of other parties addressing the restricted class. A corporation or labor organization may allow the presence of employees outside the restricted class of the corporation or labor organization who are necessary to administer the meeting, other guests of the corporation or labor organization who are being honored or speaking or participating in the event, and representatives of the news media.</P>
            <P>(ii) The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the corporation or labor organization be designated for his or her campaign or party. The incidental solicitation of persons outside the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class who may be present at the meeting as permitted by this section will not be a violation of 11 CFR part 114. The candidate's representative or party representative (other than an officer, director or other representative of a corporation or official, member or employee of a labor organization) or the candidate, may accept contributions before, during or after the appearance at the meeting, convention or other function of the corporation or labor organization.</P>
            <P>(iii) The corporation or labor organization may suggest that members of its restricted class contribute to the candidate or party committee, but the collection of contributions by any officer, director or other representative of the corporation or labor organization before, during, or after the appearance while at the meeting, is an example of a prohibited facilitation of contributions under 11 CFR 114.2(f).</P>
            <P>(iv) If the corporation or labor organization permits more than one candidate for the same office, or more than one candidate's representative or party representative, to address its restricted class, and permits the news media to cover or carry an appearance by one candidate or candidate's representative or party representative, the corporation or labor organization shall also permit the news media to cover or carry the appearances by the other candidate(s) for that office, or the other candidates' representatives or party representatives. If the corporation or labor organization permits a representative of the news media to cover or carry a candidate or candidate's representative or party representative appearance, the corporation or labor organization shall provide all other representatives of the news media with equal access for covering or carrying that appearance. Equal access is provided by—</P>
            <P>(A) Providing advance information regarding the appearance to the representatives of the news media whom the corporation or labor organization customarily contacts and other representatives of the news media upon request; and</P>
            <P>(B) Allowing all representatives of the news media to cover or carry the appearance, through the use of pooling arrangements if necessary.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Phone banks.</E> A corporation or a labor organization may establish and operate phone banks to communicate with its restricted class, urging them to register and/or vote for a particular candidate or candidates, or to register with a particular political party.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Registration and get-out-the-vote drives.</E> (i) A corporation or labor organization may conduct voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives aimed at its restricted class, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. Voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives include providing transportation to the place of registration <PRTPAGE P="211"/>and to the polls. Such drives may include communications containing express advocacy, such as urging individuals to register with a particular party or to vote for a particular candidate or candidates.</P>

            <P>(ii) Disbursements for a voter registration or get-out-the-vote drive conducted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section are not contributions or expenditures if the drive is nonpartisan. <E T="03">See</E> 52 U.S.C. 30118(b)(2)(B). A drive is nonpartisan if it is conducted so that information and other assistance regarding registering or voting, including transportation and other services offered, is not withheld or refused on the basis of support for or opposition to particular candidates or a particular political party.</P>

            <P>(iii) A corporation or labor organization may make disbursements to conduct voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives that are aimed at its restricted class and that do not qualify as nonpartisan under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, provided that the disbursements do not constitute coordinated expenditures as defined in 11 CFR 109.20, coordinated communications as defined in 11 CFR 109.21, or contributions as defined in 11 CFR part 100, subpart B. <E T="03">See also</E> note to 11 CFR 114.2(b), 114.10(a).</P>

            <P>(i) If a candidate for the House or Senate or a candidate's representative is permitted to address or meet employees, all candidates for that seat <PRTPAGE P="212"/>who request to appear must be given a similar opportunity to appear;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Separate segregated funds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund.</E> (1) A separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or as a condition of employment or by monies obtained in any commercial transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are refundable upon request of the payor.</P>
            <P>(2) A guideline for contributions may be suggested by a corporation or a labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, provided that the person soliciting or the solicitation informs the persons being solicited—</P>
            <P>(i) That the guidelines are merely suggestions; and</P>
            <P>(ii) That an individual is free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggest and the corporation or labor organization will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their contribution or their decision not to contribute.</P>
            <FP>A corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of either may not enforce any guideline for contributions.</FP>
            <P>(3) Any person soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform such employee or member of the political purposes of the fund at the time of the solicitation.</P>
            <P>(4) Any persons soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform the employee or member at the time of such solicitation of his or her right to refuse to so contribute without any reprisal.</P>
            <P>(5) Any written solicitation for a contribution to a separate segregated fund which is addressed to an employee or member must contain statements which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, and if a guideline is suggested, statements which comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of treasury monies.</E> Corporations, labor organizations, membership organizations, cooperatives, or corporations without capital stock may use general treasury monies, including monies obtained in commercial transactions and dues monies or membership fees, for the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to its separate segregated fund. A <PRTPAGE P="217"/>corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may not use the establishment, administration, and solicitation process as a means of exchanging treasury monies for voluntary contributions.</P>
            <P>(1) A contributor may not be paid for his or her contribution through a bonus, expense account, or other form of direct or indirect compensation.</P>
            <P>(2) A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may, subject to the provisions of 39 U.S.C. 3005 and chapter 61, title 18, United States Code, utilize a raffle or other fundraising device which involves a prize, so long as State law permits and the prize is not disproportionately valuable. Dances, parties, and other types of entertainment may also be used as fundraising devices. When using raffles or entertainment to raise funds, a reasonable practice to follow is for the separate segregated fund to reimburse the corporation or labor organization for costs which exceed one-third of the money contributed.</P>
            <P>(3) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Membership in separate segregated funds.</E> (1) A separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its separate segregated fund will become <E T="03">members</E> of its separate segregated fund, so long as—</P>
            <P>(i) The fund accepts contributions of all amounts, subject to the limitations of part 110;</P>
            <P>(ii) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, nothing of value may be given in return for or in the course of membership;</P>
            <P>(iii) The fund may use membership status for intangible privileges such as allowing members only to choose the candidates to whom the fund will contribute.</P>

            <P>(2) The fact that the separate segregated fund of a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is a <E T="03">membership group</E> does not provide the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock with any greater right of communication or solicitation than the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is otherwise granted under this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Control of funds.</E> A corporation, membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or labor organization may exercise control over its separate segregated fund.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Disclosure.</E> Separate segregated funds are subject to the following disclosure requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) A corporation or labor organization is not required to report any payment made or obligation incurred which is not a contribution or expenditure, as defined in § 114.1(a), except those reporting requirements specifically set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(2) A membership organization or corporation is not required to report the cost of any communication to its members or stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office, except that—</P>
            <P>(i) The costs incurred by a membership organization, including a labor organization, or by a corporation, directly attributable to a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per election, be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a); and</P>

            <P>(ii) The amounts paid or incurred for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of a candidate or political committee solely for the purpose <PRTPAGE P="218"/>of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act or chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 paid by a corporation or labor organization which is the regular employer of the individual rendering such services, shall be reported in accordance with the provisions of part 104.</P>
            <P>(3) A separate segregated fund is subject to all other disclosure requirements of political committees as set forth in part 104.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Contribution limits.</E> Separate segregated funds are subject to the contribution limitations for political committees set forth in part 110. (See particularly § 110.3).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Solicitations.</E> Except as specifically provided in §§ 114.6, 114.7, and 114.8, a corporation and/or its separate segregated fund or a labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the following limitations on solicitations:</P>
            <P>(1) A corporation or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such fund from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families. A corporation may solicit the executive or administrative personnel of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates and their families. For purposes of this section, the factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an organization is an affiliate of a corporation.</P>
            <P>(2) A labor organization, or a separate segregated fund established by a labor organization is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such a fund from any person other than its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Accidental or inadvertent solicitation.</E> Accidental or inadvertent solicitation by a corporation or labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, of persons apart from and beyond those whom it is permitted to solicit will not be deemed a violation, provided that such corporation or labor organization or separate segregated fund has used its best efforts to comply with the limitations regarding the persons it may solicit and that the method of solicitation is corrected forthwith after the discovery of such erroneous solicitation.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Communications paid for with voluntary contributions.</E> A separate segregated fund may, using voluntary contributions, communicate with the general public, except that such communications may not solicit contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock, unless such solicitation is permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Acceptance of contributions.</E> A separate segregated fund may accept contributions from persons otherwise permitted by law to make contributions.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Availability of methods.</E> Any corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, that uses a method of soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families, shall make that method available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates for soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its members and their families. Such method shall be made available on the written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the expenses incurred thereby. For example—</P>

            <P>(1) If a corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates utilizes a payroll deduction plan, check-off system, or other plan which deducts contributions from the dividend or payroll checks of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request of the labor organization, make that method available to members of the labor organization working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, who wish to contribute to the separate segregated fund of the labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates. The corporation shall make <PRTPAGE P="219"/>the payroll deduction plan available to the labor organization at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred thereby.</P>
            <P>(2) If a corporation uses a computer for addressing envelopes or labels for a solicitation to its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request, program the computer to enable the labor organization to solicit its members. The corporation shall charge the labor organization a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred in programming the computers and the allocated cost of employee time relating to the work, and the materials used.</P>
            <P>(3) If a corporation uses corporate facilities, such as a company dining room or cafeteria, for meetings of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel at which solicitations are made, the corporation shall upon written request of the labor organization allow that labor organization to use existing corporate facilities for meetings to solicit its members. The labor organization shall be required to reimburse the corporation for any actual expenses incurred thereby, such as any increase in the overhead to the corporation and any cost involved in setting up the facilities.</P>
            <P>(4) If a corporation uses no method to solicit voluntary contributions or to facilitate the making of voluntary contributions from stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, it is not required by law to make any method available to the labor organization for its members. The corporation and the labor organization may agree upon making any lawful method available even though such agreement is not required by the Act.</P>
            <P>(5) The availability of methods of twice yearly solicitations is subject to the provisions of § 114.6(e).</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Methods permitted by law to labor organizations.</E> Notwithstanding any other law, any method of soliciting voluntary contributions or of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, permitted by law to corporations with regard to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, shall also be permitted to labor organizations with regard to their members and executive or administrative personnel.</P>

Such a mailing must specifically indicate the requirement of approval and the limitation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and approval must be granted to the trade association or its separate segregated fund prior to the time any solicitation is made of the stockholders or executive or administrative personnel by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or by the corporation for contributions to the separate segregated fund of the trade association. (The request for approval may be sent to the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.)</P>

            <P>(4) A separate authorization specifically allowing a trade association to <PRTPAGE P="223"/>solicit its corporate member's stockholders, and executive or administrative personnel applies through the calendar year for which it is designated. A separate authorization by the corporate member must be designated for each year during which the solicitation is to occur. This authorization may be requested and may also be received prior to the calendar year in which the solicitation is to occur.</P>
            <P>(5) In its request to a member corporation, a trade association may indicate that it intends to solicit, for example, a limited class of the executive or administrative personnel of the member corporation, or only the executive or administrative personnel but not the stockholders of the member corporation. Moreover, in its approval, a member corporation may similarly limit any solicitation by the trade association or its separate segregated fund. In any event, a member corporation, once it has approved any solicitation—even to a limited extent—of its personnel or stockholders by a trade association or its separate segregated fund, is precluded from approving any such solicitation by another trade association or its separate segregated fund and the corporation and its personnel are precluded from soliciting the corporation's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders on behalf of another trade association or its separate segregated fund.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Solicitation.</E> (1) After a trade association has obtained the approval required in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no limit on the number of times the trade association or its separate segregated fund may solicit the persons approved by the member corporation during the calendar year to which the approval applies. The member corporation may, however, in its approval limit the number of times solicitations may be made.</P>
            <P>(2) A member corporation which grants permission to a trade association to solicit is in no way restricted in its rights under § 114.5(g) to solicit its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families for contributions to the corporation's own separate segregated fund.</P>
            <P>(3) There is no limitation on the method of soliciting voluntary contributions or the method of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions which a trade association may use.</P>
            <P>(4) A corporation may provide incidental services to collect and forward contributions from its employee stockholders and executive and administrative personnel to the separate segregated fund of a trade association of which the corporation is a member, including a payroll deduction or check-off system, upon written request of the trade association. Any corporation that provides such incidental services, and the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, shall make those incidental services available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation or the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, upon written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation or the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, for the expenses incurred thereby.</P>
            <P>(5) A trade association and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the provisions of § 114.5(a).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Solicitation of a subsidiary corporation.</E> If a parent corporation is a member of the trade association but its subsidiary is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the parent's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If a subsidiary is a member of the trade association but the parent corporation is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the subsidiary's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If both parent and subsidiary are members of the trade association, the executive or administrative personnel and their families and the stockholders and their families of each may be solicited.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Federations of trade associations.</E> (1) A federation of trade associations is an <PRTPAGE P="224"/>organization representing trade associations involved in the same or allied line of commerce. Such a federation may, subject to the following limitations, solicit the members of the federation's regional, State or local affiliates or members, provided that all of the political committees established, financed, maintained or controlled by the federation and its regional, State, or local affiliates or members are considered one political committee for the purposes of the limitations in §§ 110.1 and 110.2. The factors set forth at § 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an entity is a regional, State or local affiliate of a federation of trade associations.</P>
            <P>(i) The federation and its member associations may engage in a joint solicitation; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The member association may delegate its solicitation rights to the federation.</P>
            <P>(2) A federation is subject to the provisions of this section when soliciting the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the corporate members of its member associations.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Communications other than solicitations.</E> A trade association may make communications, other than solicitations, to its members and their families under the provisions of § 114.3. When making communications to a member which is a corporation, the trade association may communicate with the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Trade association employees.</E> (1) A trade association may communicate with its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.3; a trade association may communicate with its other employees under the provisions of § 114.4.</P>
            <P>(2) A trade association may solicit its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.5(g); a trade association may solicit its other employees under the provisions of § 114.6.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Safe harbor.</E> For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following shall be considered occasional, isolated, or incidental use of labor organization facilities:</P>
            <P>(i) Any individual volunteer activity that does not exceed one hour per week or four hours per month, regardless of whether the activity is undertaken during or after normal working hours; or</P>

            <P>(a) A corporation may establish and administer an employee participation plan (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a <E T="03">trustee plan</E>) which is a political giving program in which a corporation pays the cost of establishing and administering separate bank accounts for any employee who wishes to participate. The cost of administering and establishing includes the payment of costs for a payroll deduction or check-off plan and the cost of maintaining the separate bank accounts.</P>
            <P>(1) The employees must exercise complete control and discretion over the disbursement of the monies in their accounts.</P>
            <P>(2) The trustee, bank, or other administrator shall not provide the corporation or its separate segregated fund any report of the source or recipient of any contribution(s) or donation(s) into or out of any account or of the amount any employee has in an account.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Debts owed by terminating committees, ongoing committees, and authorized committees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Terminating committees.</E> A terminating committee may settle outstanding debts provided that the terminating committee files a debt settlement plan and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 are satisfied. The Commission will review each debt settlement plan filed to determine whether or not the terminating committee appears to have complied with the requirements set forth in this part, and whether or not the proposed debt settlement plan would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Ongoing committees.</E> Ongoing committees shall not settle any outstanding debts for less than the entire amount owed, but may request a Commission determination that such debts are not payable under 11 CFR 116.9, and may resolve disputed debts under 11 CFR 116.10. Creditors may forgive debts owed by ongoing committees under the limited circumstances provided in 11 CFR 116.8.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Authorized committees.</E> (1) An authorized committee shall not settle any outstanding debts for less than the entire amount owed if any other authorized committee of the same candidate has permissible funds available to pay part or all of the amount outstanding. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3), of this section, an authorized committee shall not terminate under 11 CFR 102.3 if—</P>
            <P>(i) It has any outstanding debts or obligations; or</P>
            <P>(ii) It has any funds or assets available to pay part or all of the outstanding debts or obligations owed by another authorized committee of the same candidate and that other authorized committee is unable to pay such debts or obligations.</P>
            <P>(2) No transfers of funds may be made from a candidate's authorized committee to another authorized committee of the same candidate if the transferor committee has net debts outstanding at the time of the transfer under the formula described in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3)(ii).</P>

            <P>(3) An authorized committee that qualifies as a terminating committee may assign debts to another authorized committee of the same candidate to the extent permitted under applicable state law provided that the authorized committee assigning the debts has no cash on hand or assets available to pay any part of the outstanding debts, and provided that the authorized committee assigning the debts was not organized to further the candidate's campaign in an election not yet held. If a Presidential candidate elects to receive federal funds pursuant to 11 CFR part 9001 <E T="03">et seq.</E> or 11 CFR part 9031 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> the authorized committee(s) of the Presidential candidate shall not assign debts or receive assigned debts until after the authorized committee(s) or the Presidential candidate has made all required repayments pursuant to 11 CFR parts 9007 and 9038 and has paid all civil penalties pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30109. An authorized committee that has assigned all its outstanding debts may terminate if—</P>
            <P>(i) The authorized committee that has assigned the debts otherwise qualifies for termination under 11 CFR 102.3; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The authorized committee that received the assigned debts notifies the Commission in writing that it has assumed the obligation to pay the entire amount owed and that it has assumed the obligation to report the debts, and <PRTPAGE P="231"/>any contributions received for retirement of the assigned debts, in accordance with 11 CFR part 104. The assigned debts shall be disclosed on a separate schedule of debts and obligations attached to the authorized committee's reports. Contributions received for retirement of the assigned debts shall be disclosed on a separate schedule of receipts attached to the authorized committee's reports. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 110.1 (b)(3) and (b)(4) and 110.2 (b)(3) and (b)(4). The authorized committee that has assigned the debts shall notify each creditor in writing of the assignment no later than thirty days before the assignment takes effect and shall include the name and address of the authorized committee that will receive the assigned debts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Extensions of credit by commercial vendors.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Unincorporated vendor.</E> A commercial vendor that is not a corporation may extend credit to a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee. An extension of credit will not be considered a contribution to the candidate or political committee provided that the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the commercial vendor's business and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Incorporated vendor.</E> A corporation in its capacity as a commercial vendor may extend credit to a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee provided that the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the corporation's business and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ordinary course of business.</E> In determining whether credit was extended in the ordinary course of business, the Commission will consider—</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the commercial vendor followed its established procedures and its past practice in approving the extension of credit;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the commercial vendor received prompt payment in full if it previously extended credit to the same candidate or political committee; and</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the extension of credit conformed to the usual and normal practice in the commercial vendor's trade or industry.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Extension of credit by regulated industries.</E> The Commission may rely on the regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Department of Transportation on behalf of the Civil Aeronautics Board, issued pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30141 and any other regulations prescribed by other Federal agencies to determine whether extensions of credit by the entities regulated by those Federal agencies were made in the ordinary course of business.</P>

The amount forgiven will not be considered a contribution by the commercial vendor to the candidate or political committee if—</P>
            <P>(1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of contribution in 11 CFR part 100, subpart C; or</P>
            <P>(2) The commercial vendor has treated the debt in a commercially reasonable manner and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, are satisfied.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Incorporated vendor.</E> A corporation may not forgive or settle a debt incurred by a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee for less than the entire amount owed on the debt unless—</P>
            <P>(1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of contribution in 11 CFR part 100, subpart C; or</P>

            <P>(2) The corporation has treated the debt in a commercially reasonable manner and the requirements of 11 <PRTPAGE P="232"/>CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, are satisfied.</P>

            <P>(1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of contribution in 11 CFR part 100, subpart C; or</P>
            <P>(2) The candidate and the political committee have undertaken all reasonable efforts to satisfy the outstanding debt and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, including the submission of the information specified in those sections and Commission review, are satisfied.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Commercially reasonable.</E> The Commission will determine that a debt settlement between a political committee and a commercial vendor is commercially reasonable if—</P>
            <P>(1) The initial extension of credit was made in accordance with 11 CFR 116.3;</P>
            <P>(2) The candidate or political committee has undertaken all reasonable efforts to satisfy the outstanding debt. Such efforts may include, but are not limited to, the following—</P>
            <P>(i) Engaging in fundraising efforts;</P>
            <P>(ii) Reducing overhead and administrative costs; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Liquidating assets; and</P>
            <P>(3) The commercial vendor has pursued its remedies as vigorously as it would pursue its remedies against a nonpolitical debtor in similar circumstances. Such remedies may include, but are not limited to, the following—</P>
            <P>(i) Oral and written requests for payment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Withholding delivery of additional goods or services until overdue debts are satisfied;</P>

            <P>(v) Litigation.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Settlement or forgiveness not required.</E> The provisions of this part shall not be construed to require a commercial vendor to forgive or settle the debt for less than the entire amount owed.</P>

If the payment is not exempted under 11 CFR 100.79, it shall be considered a contribution by the individual unless—</P>
            <P>(1) The payment is for the individual's transportation expenses incurred while traveling on behalf of a candidate or political committee of a political party or for usual and normal subsistence expenses incurred by an individual, other than a volunteer, while traveling on behalf of a candidate or political committee of a political party; and</P>

For purposes of this section, the closing date shall be the date indicated on the billing statement which serves as the cutoff date for determining which charges are included on that billing <PRTPAGE P="233"/>statement.

            <SUBJECT>Creditor forgiveness of debts owed by ongoing committees; Commission review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> A creditor may forgive the outstanding balance of a debt owed by an ongoing committee if the creditor and the ongoing committee have satisfied the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3 or 116.5, as appropriate, regarding extensions of credit by commercial vendors and advances by committee staff and other individuals, and the debt has been outstanding for at least twenty-four months, and—</P>
            <P>(1) The creditor has exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to locate the ongoing committee and has been unable to do so; or</P>
            <P>(2) The ongoing committee—</P>
            <P>(i) Does not have sufficient cash on hand to pay the creditor;</P>
            <P>(ii) Has receipts of less than $1000 during the previous twenty-four months;</P>
            <P>(iii) Has disbursements of less than $1000 during the previous twenty-four months; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Owes debts to other creditors of such magnitude that the creditor could reasonably conclude that the ongoing committee will not pay this particular debt.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for forgiving debts.</E> A creditor that intends to forgive a debt owed by an ongoing committee shall notify the Commission by letter of its intent. The letter shall demonstrate that the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied. The letter shall provide the following information—</P>
            <P>(1) The terms of the initial extension of credit and a description of the terms under which the creditor has extended credit to nonpolitical debtors of similar risk and size of obligation;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the efforts made by the candidate or the ongoing committee to satisfy the debt;</P>

            <P>(3) A description of the remedies pursued by the creditor to obtain payment of the debt and a comparison to the <PRTPAGE P="236"/>remedies customarily pursued by the creditor in similar circumstances involving nonpolitical debtors; and</P>
            <P>(4) An indication that the creditor has forgiven other debts involving nonpolitical debtors in similar circumstances, if any.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Commission review.</E> Upon the Commission's request, the ongoing committee or the creditor shall provide such additional information as the Commission may require to review the creditor's request. The Commission will review each request to forgive a debt to determine whether the candidate, the ongoing committee, and the creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR part 116, and whether or not the forgiveness of the debt would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Creditors that cannot be found or that are out of business.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> A political committee may request that the Commission determine that a debt owed to a creditor is not payable for purposes of the Act if the debt has been outstanding for at least twenty-four months, and the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate, have been satisfied, and—</P>
            <P>(1) The creditor has gone out of business and no other entity has a right to be paid the amount owed; or</P>

            <P>(2) The political committee has exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to locate the creditor and has been unable to do so. <E T="03">Reasonable diligence in attempting to locate the creditor</E> means the political committee has attempted to ascertain the current address and telephone number, and has attempted to contact the creditor by registered or certified mail, and either in person or by telephone.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Terminating committees.</E> If the political committee making the request is a terminating committee, the terminating committee shall include the request in a debt settlement plan filed with the Commission, and shall demonstrate that the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3, 116.5 or 116.6, as appropriate, and 116.9(a) are satisfied. The terminating committee shall continue to disclose the debt on its schedules of outstanding debts and obligations until the Commission has completed its review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) and has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ongoing committees.</E> If the political committee making the request is an ongoing committee, the ongoing committee shall make the request in writing and shall demonstrate that the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3, 116.5 or 116.6, as appropriate, and 116.9(a) are satisfied. The Commission will review the request to determine whether the ongoing committee and the creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR part 116, and to determine whether reporting the debt as not payable would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations. The ongoing committee shall continue to disclose the debt on its schedules of outstanding debts and obligations until the Commission has completed its review of the request and has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> Upon notification that the Commission has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act, the political committee may list the debt as not payable on the next due report. Notwithstanding 11 CFR 104.11, the debt does not have to be included in subsequent reports unless the status of the debt changes. The presence of a debt that the Commission has determined is not payable shall not bar the political committee from terminating its registration pursuant to 11 CFR 102.3.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reporting disputed debts.</E> A political committee shall report a disputed debt in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 if the creditor has provided something of value to the political committee. Until the dispute is resolved, the political committee shall disclose on the appropriate reports any amounts paid to the creditor, any amount the political committee admits it owes and the amount the creditor claims is owed. The political committee may also note on the appropriate reports that the disclosure of the disputed debt does not constitute <PRTPAGE P="237"/>an admission of liability or a waiver of any claims the political committee may have against the creditor. (<E T="03">See also</E> 11 CFR 9035.1(a)(2) regarding the effect of disputed debts on a candidate's expenditure limitations under 11 CFR part 9035.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Disputed debts owed by terminating committees.</E> If a terminating committee and a creditor have been unable to resolve a disputed debt, and the terminating committee files a debt settlement plan covering other debts or other creditors, the terminating committee shall include in the debt settlement plan a brief description as to the nature of the dispute and the status of the terminating committee's efforts to resolve the dispute. The debt settlement plan need not include a signed affidavit from the creditor involved in the dispute pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(e)(2).</P>

            <P>(1) If the authorized committee uses the amount of cash on hand as of the day after the election to repay all or part of the personal loans, it must do so within 20 days of the election.</P>
            <P>(2) Within 20 days of the election date, the authorized committee must treat the portion of the aggregate outstanding balance of the personal loans that exceeds $250,000 minus the amount of cash on hand as of the day after the election used to repay the loan as a contribution by the candidate.</P>
            <P>(3) The candidate's principal campaign committee must report the transactions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section in the first report scheduled to be filed after the election pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5(a) or (b).</P>

            <P>(a) Any interested person may file with the Commission a written petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule implementing any of the following statutes:</P>

            <P>(1) The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, 52 U.S.C. 30101 <E T="03">et seq.;</E>

            </P>
            <P>(4) The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552; or</P>
            <P>(5) Any other law that the Commission is required to implement and administer.</P>
            <P>(b) The petition shall—</P>
            <P>(1) Include the name and address of the petitioner or agent. An authorized agent of the petitioner may submit the petition, but the agent shall disclose the identity of his or her principal;</P>
            <P>(2) Identify itself as a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule;</P>
            <P>(3) Identify the specific section(s) of the regulations to be affected;</P>

            <P>(d) The Commission may, in its discretion, treat a document that fails to conform to the format requirements of paragraph (b) of this section as a basis for a sua sponte rulemaking. For example, the Commission may consider whether to initiate a rulemaking project addressing issues raised in an advisory opinion request submitted under 11 CFR 112.1 or in a complaint filed under 11 CFR 111.4. However, the Commission need not follow the procedures of 11 CFR 200.3 in these instances.</P>

            <P>(1) Publish a Notice of Availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> stating that the petition is available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Records Office and that statements in support of or in opposition to the petition may be filed within a stated period after publication of the notice;</P>
            <P>(2) Send a letter to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30111(f), seeking the IRS's comments on the petition; and</P>

            <P>(b) If the petition does not comply with the requirements of 11 CFR <PRTPAGE P="239"/>200.2(b), the Office of General Counsel may notify the petitioner of the nature of any discrepancies.</P>

            <P>(c) If the Commission decides that a Notice of Inquiry, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or a public hearing on the petition would contribute to its determination whether to commence a rulemaking proceeding, it will publish an appropriate notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> to advise interested persons and to invite their participation.</P>
            <P>(d) The Commission will not consider the merits of the petition before the expiration of the comment period on the Notice of Availability.</P>

A solicitation may be made directly or indirectly. The context includes the conduct of persons involved in the communication. A solicitation does not include mere statements of political support or mere guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.</P>

            <P>(ii) A communication that provides instructions on how or where to send contributions or donations, including providing a phone number specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations. However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of “to solicit” merely because it includes a mailing address or phone number that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations.</P>

            <P>(iii) A communication that identifies a Web address where the Web page displayed is specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation, or automatically redirects <PRTPAGE P="247"/>the Internet user to such a page, or exclusively displays a link to such a page.

            <P>(viii) “Group X is having a fundraiser this week; you should go.”</P>
            <P>(ix) “You have reached the limit of what you may contribute directly to my campaign, but you can further help my campaign by assisting the State party.”</P>
            <P>(x) A candidate hands a potential donor a list of people who have contributed to a group and the amounts of their contributions. The candidate says, “I see you are not on the list.”</P>
            <P>(xi) “I will not forget those who contribute at this crucial stage.”</P>
            <P>(xii) “The candidate will be very pleased if we can count on you for $10,000.”</P>
            <P>(xiii) “Your contribution to this campaign would mean a great deal to the entire party and to me personally.”</P>
            <P>(xiv) Candidate says to potential donor: “The money you will help us raise will allow us to communicate our message to the voters through Labor Day.”</P>
            <P>(xv) “I appreciate all you've done in the past for our party in this State. Looking ahead, we face some tough elections. I'd be very happy if you could maintain the same level of financial support for our State party this year.”</P>
            <P>(xvi) The head of Group X solicits a contribution from a potential donor in the presence of a candidate. The donor asks the candidate if the contribution to Group X would be a good idea and would help the candidate's campaign. The candidate nods affirmatively.</P>
            <P>(3) The following statements do not constitute solicitations:</P>
            <P>(i) During a policy speech, the candidate says: “Thank you for your support of the Democratic Party.”</P>
            <P>(ii) At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your support of my campaign.”</P>
            <P>(iii) At a Labor Day rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your past financial support of the Republican Party.”</P>
            <P>(iv) At a GOTV rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your continuing support.”</P>
            <P>(v) At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: “It is critical that we support the entire Democratic ticket in November.”</P>
            <P>(vi) A Federal officeholder says: “Our Senator has done a great job for us this year. The policies she has vigorously promoted in the Senate have really helped the economy of the State.”</P>

            <P>(n) <E T="03">To direct.</E> For the purposes of part 300, <E T="03">to direct</E> means to guide, directly or indirectly, a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value, by identifying a candidate, political committee or organization, for the receipt of such funds, or things of value. The contribution, donation, transfer, or thing of value may be made or provided directly or through a conduit or intermediary. Direction does not include merely providing information or guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Individual holding Federal office. Individual holding Federal office</E> means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or a Senator <PRTPAGE P="248"/>or a Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.</P>

This section also covers participation by Federal candidates and officeholders in publicity related to such non-Federal fundraising events. This section applies even if funds that comply with the amount limitations and source prohibitions of the Act are also solicited at the event. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the fundraising exception for State candidates at 11 CFR 300.63 or the fundraising exceptions for certain tax-exempt organizations at 11 CFR 300.65.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Participation at non-Federal fundraising events.</E> A Federal candidate or officeholder may:</P>

              <P>(i) A Federal candidate or officeholder may limit such a solicitation by displaying at the fundraising event a clear and conspicuous written notice, or making a clear and conspicuous oral statement, that the solicitation is not for Levin funds (when applicable), does not seek funds in excess of $[Federally permissible amount], and does not seek funds from corporations, labor organizations, national banks, federal government contractors, or foreign nationals.</P>
              <P>(ii) A written notice or oral statement is not clear and conspicuous if it is difficult to read or hear or if its placement is easily overlooked by any significant number of those in attendance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Publicity for non-Federal fundraising events.</E> For the purposes of this paragraph, publicity for a non-Federal fundraising event includes, but is not limited to, advertisements, announcements, or pre-event invitation materials, regardless of format or medium of communication.</P>

              <P>(A) The Federal candidate or officeholder is identified as a featured guest, honored guest, special guest, featured speaker, or honored speaker, or in any other manner not specifically related to fundraising; and</P>
              <P>(B) The publicity includes a clear and conspicuous disclaimer that the solicitation is not being made by the Federal candidate or officeholder.</P>
              <P>(ii) The disclaimer required in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section must meet the requirements in 11 CFR 110.11(c)(2) if the publicity is written.</P>
              <P>(iii) Where publicity is disseminated by non-written means, the disclaimer described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section is required only if the publicity is recorded or follows any form of written script or is conducted according to a structured or organized program.</P>

              <P>(A) The Federal candidate or officeholder is identified as serving in a position specifically related to fundraising, such as honorary chairperson or member of a host committee, or is identified in the publicity as extending an invitation to the event, even if the communication contains a written disclaimer as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(B) The Federal candidate or officeholder signs the communication, even if the communication contains a written disclaimer as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) A Federal candidate, officeholder, or an agent of either, may not disseminate publicity for a non-Federal fundraising event that contains a solicitation of funds outside the amount limitations and source prohibitions of the Act or Levin funds by someone other than the Federal candidate or officeholder.</P>

An expenditure which constitutes such a violation shall nevertheless count against the candidate's expenditure limitation if the expenditure meets the conditions set forth at 11 CFR 9002.11(a) (1) and (2).<PRTPAGE P="269"/>

If payments for such services are made by a minor or new party candidate from an account containing private contributions, the payments do not count against that candidate's expenditure limitation. The amount paid by the committee shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 9006. Amounts paid by the regular employer of the person providing such services pursuant to 11 CFR 100.86 and 100.146 shall be reported by the recipient committee in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(h).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Legal and accounting compliance fund—major party candidates</E>—(1) <E T="03">Sources.</E> (i) A major party candidate, or an individual who is seeking the nomination of a major party, may accept contributions to a legal and accounting compliance fund if such contributions are received and disbursed in accordance with this section. A general election legal and accounting compliance fund (“GELAC”) may be established by such individual prior to being nominated or selected as the candidate of a political party for the office of President or Vice President of the United States. Before April 1 of the calendar year in which a Presidential general election is held, contributions may only be deposited in the GELAC if they are made for the primary and exceed the contributor's contribution limits for the primary and are lawfully redesignated for the GELAC pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1.</P>
            <P>(A) All solicitations for contributions to the GELAC shall clearly state that Federal law prohibits private contributions from being used for the candidate's election and that contributions will be used solely for legal and accounting services to ensure compliance with Federal law, and shall clearly state how contribution checks should be made payable. Contributions shall not be solicited for the GELAC before April 1 of the calendar year in which a Presidential general election is held. If the candidate does not become the nominee, all contributions accepted for the GELAC, including redesignated contributions, shall be refunded within sixty (60) days after the candidate's date of ineligibility.</P>
            <P>(B) Contributions to the GELAC shall be subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 110, 114, and 115.</P>
            <P>(C) Contributions shall be deposited in the GELAC only if they are designated in writing for the GELAC, or transferred pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this section. Any contribution which otherwise could be matched pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.2 shall not be considered designated in writing for the GELAC unless the contributor specifically redesignates it for the GELAC or unless it is accompanied by a proper designation for the GELAC. Any contribution that is designated in writing or redesignated for the GELAC shall not be matched pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.2.</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) Contributions made during the matching payment period that do not exceed the contributor's limit for the primary election may be redesignated for the GELAC and subsequently transferred to the GELAC before the nomination only if—</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The contributions represent funds in excess of any amount needed to pay remaining primary expenses;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The contributions have not been submitted for matching;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The written redesignations are received within 60 days of the Treasurer's receipt of the contributions; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The requirements of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5)(i) and (ii)(A) and 110.1(l) regarding redesignation are satisfied.</P>
            <P>(B) All contributions redesignated and deposited pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall be subject to the contribution limitations applicable for the general election pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1(b)(2)(i).</P>

            <P>(iii) Funds received during the matching payment period that are remaining in a candidate's primary election account after the nomination may be transferred to the GELAC without regard to the contribution limitations of 11 CFR part 110 and used for any purpose permitted under this section, only if the funds are in excess of any amount needed to pay remaining net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.1(b) and any amount <PRTPAGE P="274"/>required to be reimbursed to the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account under 11 CFR 9038.2. The excess funds so transferred may include contributions made before the beginning of the expenditure report period, which contributions do not exceed the contributor's limit for the primary election. Such contributions need not be redesignated by the contributors for the GELAC.</P>
            <P>(iv) Contributions that are made after the beginning of the expenditure report period but that are not designated in writing for the GELAC are considered made with respect to the primary election and may be redesignated for the GELAC and transferred to the GELAC only if—</P>
            <P>(A) The funds are in excess of any amount needed to pay remaining net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.1(b) and any amount required to be reimbursed to the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account under 11 CFR 9038.2;</P>
            <P>(B) The contributions have not been submitted for matching; and</P>
            <P>(C) The candidate obtains the contributor's written redesignation in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1.</P>

            <P>(v) Contributions made with respect to the primary election that exceed the contributor's limit for the primary election may be redesignated for the GELAC and transferred to the GELAC if the candidate redesignates the contribution for the GELAC in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5)(i) and (ii)(A) or (ii)(B). For purposes of this section only, 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) shall not apply.</P>
            <P>(vi) For purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be designated in writing for the GELAC if—</P>

            <P>(B) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the contributor, which clearly indicates that it is made with respect to the GELAC.</P>

            </P>

            <P>(ii)(A) Expenditures for payroll (including payroll taxes), overhead and computer services, a portion of which are related to ensuring compliance with Title 52 of the United States Code <PRTPAGE P="275"/>and Chapter 95 of Title 26 of the United States Code, shall be initially paid from the candidate's Federal fund account under 11 CFR 9005.2 and may be later reimbursed by the compliance fund.

The candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The records shall indicate which computer functions are considered compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with each computer function.</P>
            <P>(F) The Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding contains some accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of salaries and overhead expenditures that may be considered exempt compliance costs.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Candidate of a minor party in the preceding election.</E> An eligible candidate of a minor party is entitled to pre-election payments:</P>
            <P>(1) If he or she received at least 5% of the total popular vote as the candidate of a minor party in the preceding election whether or not he or she is the same minor party's candidate in this election.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Excessive expenditures.</E> An expenditure which is in excess of any of the limitations under 11 CFR 9003.2 shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures attributable to these limitations using the full amounts originally charged for goods and services rendered to the committee and not the amounts for which such obligations were later settled and paid, unless the committee can demonstrate that the lower amount paid reflects a reasonable settlement of a bona fide dispute with the creditor.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report period.</E> Except for accounts payable pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section and winding down costs pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.11, any expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report period, as defined in 11 CFR 9002.12, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Civil or criminal penalties.</E> Civil or criminal penalties paid pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from payments received under 11 CFR part 9005. Penalties may be paid from contributions in the candidate's legal and accounting compliance fund, in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(C). Additional amounts may be received and expended to pay such penalties, if necessary. These funds shall not be considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and expended under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 104.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Solicitation expenses.</E> Any expenses incurred by a major party candidate to solicit contributions to a legal and accounting compliance fund established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3(a) are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from payments received under 11 CFR part 9005.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Payments to candidate.</E> Payments made to the candidate by his or her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Payments to other authorized committees.</E> Payments, including transfers, contributions and loans, to other committees authorized by the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Lost, misplaced, or stolen items.</E> The cost of lost, misplaced, or stolen items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; whether the committee sought or obtained insurance on the items; whether the committee filed a police report; the type of equipment involved; <PRTPAGE P="283"/>and the number and value of items that were lost.</P>

            <P>(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related stop and from the stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event, and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.</P>

Capital assets include items such as computer systems and telecommunications systems, if the equipment is used together and if the total cost of all components that are used together exceeds $2000. A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(1). The fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be 60% of the total original cost of such items when acquired, except that items received after the end of the expenditure report period must be valued at their fair market value on the date acquired. A candidate may claim a lower fair market value for a capital asset by listing that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrating, through documentation, the lower fair market value.</P>
            <P>(ii) If capital assets are obtained from the candidate's primary election committee, the purchase price shall be considered to be 60% of the original cost of such assets to the candidate's primary election committee. For purposes of the statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses filed after the end of the expenditure report period, the fair market value of capital assets obtained from the candidate's primary election committee shall be considered to be 20% of the original cost of such assets to the candidate's primary election committee.</P>
            <P>(iii) Items purchased from the primary election committee that are not capital assets, and also are not other assets under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, shall be listed on an inventory that states their valuation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other assets.</E> The term <E T="03">other assets</E> means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign loans. “Other assets” must be included on the candidate's statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item on the last day of the expenditure report period or the day on which the individual ceased to be a candidate, whichever is earlier, unless the item is acquired after these dates, in which case the item shall be valued on the date it is acquired. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(2).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Collectibility of accounts receivable.</E> If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how the lesser amount or full write-off was determined.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Review of candidate statement</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission will review the statement filed by each candidate under this section. The Commission may request further information with respect to statements filed pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9(b) during the audit of that candidate's authorized committee(s) under 11 CFR part 9007.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Candidate eligible for post-election funding.</E> (i) If, in reviewing the preliminary statement of a candidate eligible to receive post-election funding, the Commission receives information indicating that substantial assets of that candidate's authorized committee(s) have been undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of outstanding qualified campaign expenses has been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily postpone its certification of funds to that candidate pending a final determination of whether the candidate is entitled to all or a portion of the funds for which he or she is eligible based on the percentage of votes the candidate received in the general election.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> In making a determination under 11 CFR <PRTPAGE P="288"/>9004.9(f)(2)(i), the Commission will notify the candidate within 10 business days after its receipt of the statement of its initial determination that the candidate is not entitled to receive the full amount for which the candidate may be eligible. The notice will give the legal and factual reasons for the initial determination and advise the candidate of the evidence on which the Commission's initial determination is based. The candidate will be given the opportunity to revise the statement or to submit, within 10 business days, written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the candidate has net outstanding qualified campaign expenses that entitle the candidate to post-election funds. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials submitted by the candidate before making its final determination. A final determination that the candidate is entitled to receive only a portion or no post-election funding will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation on which the determination is based.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding qualified campaign expenses still exceeds committee assets, the Commission will certify the payment of post-election funds to which the candidate is entitled.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing.</E> The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a final determination under this section in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(a).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Audits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) After each Presidential election, the Commission will conduct a thorough examination and audit of the receipts, disbursements, debts and obligations of each candidate, his or her authorized committee(s), and agents of such candidates or committees. Such examination and audit will include, but will not be limited to, expenditures pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.4 prior to the beginning of the expenditure report period, contributions to and expenditures made from the legal and accounting compliance fund established under 11 CFR 9003.3(a), contributions received to supplement any payments received from the Fund, and qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition, the Commission may conduct other examinations and audits from time to time as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(3) Information obtained pursuant to any audit and examination conducted under 11 CFR 9007.1(a) (1) and (2) may be used by the Commission as the basis, or partial basis, for its repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Conduct of fieldwork.</E> (1) If the candidate or the candidate's authorized <PRTPAGE P="292"/>committee does not maintain or use any computerized information containing the data listed in 11 CFR 9003.6, the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data listed in 11 CFR 9003.6, the Commission generally will request such information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such request. Upon receipt of the computerized information requested and compliance with the technical specifications of 11 CFR 9003.6(b), the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request additional or updated computerized information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously provided, and which may be used for purposes including, but not limited to, updating a statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional computerized information which was created by or becomes available to the committee that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the Commission's request.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Office space and records.</E> On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall provide Commission staff with office space and committee records in accordance with the candidate and committee agreement under 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(6).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Availability of committee personnel.</E> On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall have committee personnel present at the site of the fieldwork. Such personnel shall be familiar with the committee's records and operation and shall be available to Commission staff to answer questions and to aid in locating records.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Failure to provide staff, records or office space.</E> If the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) fail to provide adequate office space, personnel or committee records, the Commission may seek judicial intervention under 52 U.S.C. 30107 or 26 U.S.C. 9010(c) to enforce the candidate and committee agreement made under 11 CFR 9003.1(b). Before seeking judicial intervention, the Commission will notify the candidate of his or her failure to comply with the agreement and will recommend corrective action to bring the candidate into compliance. Upon receipt of the Commission's notification, the candidate will have ten (10) calendar days in which to take the corrective action indicated or to otherwise demonstrate to the Commission in writing that he or she is complying with the candidate and committee agreements.</P>
            <P>(iv) If, in the course of the audit process, a dispute arises over the documentation sought or other requirements of the candidate agreement, the candidate may seek review by the Commission of the issues raised. To seek review, the candidate shall submit a written statement within 10 days after the disputed Commission staff request is made, describing the dispute and indicating the candidate's proposed alternative(s).</P>

            <P>(v) If the candidate or his or her authorized committee fails to produce particular records, materials, evidence or other information requested by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(1) or a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(3). The procedures set forth in 11 CFR 111.11 through 111.15, as appropriate, shall apply to the production of such records, materials, evidence or other information as specified in the <PRTPAGE P="293"/>order, subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.</P>
            <P>(2) Fieldwork will include the following steps designed to keep the candidate and committee informed as to the progress of the audit and to expedite the process:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Entrance conference.</E> At the outset of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an entrance conference, at which the candidate's representatives will be advised of the purpose of the audit and the general procedures to be followed. Future requirements of the candidate and his or her authorized committee, such as possible repayments to the United States Treasury, will also be discussed. Committee representatives shall provide information and records necessary to conduct the audit, and Commission staff will be available to answer committee questions.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> During the fieldwork, Commission staff will review committee records and may conduct interviews of committee personnel. Commission staff will be available to explain aspects of the audit and examination as it progresses. Additional meetings between Commission staff and committee personnel may be held from time to time during the fieldwork to discuss possible audit findings and to resolve issues arising during the course of the audit.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exit conference.</E> At the conclusion of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an exit conference to discuss with committee representatives the staff's preliminary findings and recommendations that the staff anticipates it will present to the Commission for approval. Commission staff will advise committee representatives at this conference of the committee's opportunity to respond to these preliminary findings; the projected timetables regarding the issuance of the Preliminary Audit Report, the Audit Report, and any repayment determination; the committee's opportunity for an administrative review of any repayment determination; and the procedures involved in Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2.</P>
            <P>(3) Commission staff may conduct additional fieldwork after the completion of the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(b) (1) and (2). Factors that may necessitate such follow-up fieldwork include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Committee response to audit findings;</P>
            <P>(ii) Financial activity of the committee subsequent to the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(b)(1);</P>
            <P>(iii) Committee responses to Commission repayment determinations made under 11 CFR 9007.2.</P>
            <P>(4) The Commission will notify the candidate and his or her authorized committee if follow-up fieldwork is necessary. The provisions of 11 CFR 9007.1(b) (1) and (2) will apply to any additional fieldwork conducted.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Preliminary Audit Report: Issuance by Commission and committee response.</E> (1) Commission staff will prepare a written Preliminary Audit Report, which will be provided to the committee after it is approved by an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the Commission. The Preliminary Audit Report may include—</P>
            <P>(i) An evaluation of procedures and systems employed by the candidate and committee to comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and Commission regulations;</P>
            <P>(ii) The accuracy of statements and reports filed with the Commission by the candidate and committee; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Preliminary calculations regarding future repayments to the United States Treasury.</P>
            <P>(2) The candidate and his or her authorized committee may submit in writing within 60 calendar days after receipt of the Preliminary Audit Report, legal and factual materials disputing or commenting on the proposed findings contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, the committee shall submit any additional documentation requested by the Commission. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval and issuance of the audit report.</E> (1) Before voting on whether to approve and issue an audit report, the Commission will consider any written legal and factual materials timely submitted by the candidate or his or her <PRTPAGE P="294"/>authorized committee in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The Commission-approved audit report may address issues other than those contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, this report will contain a repayment determination made by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) The audit report may contain issues that warrant referral to the Office of General Counsel for possible enforcement proceedings under 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111.</P>
            <P>(3) Addenda to the audit report may be approved and issued by the Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant and as additional information becomes available. Such addenda may be based on follow-up fieldwork conducted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) (1) and (2) of this section will be followed in preparing such addenda. The addenda will be placed on the public record as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Such addenda may also include additional repayment determination(s).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Public release of audit report.</E> (1) The Commission will consider the audit report in an open session agenda document. The Commission will provide the candidate and the committee with copies of any agenda document to be considered in an open session 24 hours prior to releasing the agenda document to the public.</P>
            <P>(2) Following Commission approval of the audit report, the report will be forwarded to the committee and released to the public. The Commission will provide the candidate and committee with copies of the audit report approved by the Commission 24 hours before releasing the report to the public.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) <E T="03">Sampling.</E> In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted statistical sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole or in part, of any audit finding.</P>
            <P>(2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding shall respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any apparent errors found among the sample items were not errors, the Commission shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.</P>
            <P>(3) Within 30 days of service of the Final Audit Report, the committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3); or take any other action required by the Commission with respect to sample-based findings.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Repayments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A candidate who has received payments from the Fund under 11 CFR part 9005 shall pay the United States Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable under this section. In making repayment determinations under this section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1 or otherwise obtained by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission will notify the candidate of any repayment determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not later than 3 years after the day of the presidential election. The Commission's issuance of the audit report to the candidate under 11 CFR 9007.1(d) will constitute notification for purposes of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) Once the candidate receives notice of the Commission's repayment determination under this section, the candidate should give preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of his or her committee, except for any federal taxes owed by the committee.<PRTPAGE P="295"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) Repayments may be made only from the following sources: personal funds of the candidate (without regard to the limitations of 11 CFR 9003.2(c)), contributions and federal funds in the committee's account(s), and any additional funds raised subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Bases for repayment.</E> The Commission may determine that an eligible candidate of a political party who has received payments from the Fund must repay the United States Treasury under any of the circumstances described below.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Payments in excess of candidate's entitlement.</E> If the Commission determines that any portion of the payments made to the candidate was in excess of the aggregate payments to which such candidate was entitled, it will so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to such portion.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses.</E> (i) If the Commission determines that any amount of any payment to an eligible candidate from the Fund was used for purposes other than those described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) through (C) of this section, it will notify the candidate of the amount so used, and such candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to such amount.</P>
            <P>(A) To defray qualified campaign expenses;</P>
            <P>(B) To repay loans, the proceeds of which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses; and</P>
            <P>(C) To restore funds (other than contributions which were received and expended by minor or new party candidates to defray qualified campaign expenses) which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(ii) Examples of Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2(b)(2) include, but are not limited to the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Determinations that a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) have incurred expenses in excess of the aggregate payments to which an eligible major party candidate is entitled;</P>
            <P>(B) Determinations that amounts spent by a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) from the Fund were not documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5;</P>
            <P>(C) Determinations that any portion of the payments made to a candidate from the Fund was expended in violation of State or Federal law; and</P>
            <P>(D) Determinations that any portion of the payments made to a candidate from the Fund was used to defray expenses resulting from a violation of State or Federal law, such as the payment of fines or penalties.</P>
            <P>(iii) In the case of a candidate who has received contributions pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3 (b) or (c), the amount of any repayment sought under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount determined to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of payments certified to the candidate from the Fund bears to the total deposits, as of December 31 of the Presidential election year. For purposes of this section, total deposits means all deposits to all candidate accounts minus transfers between accounts, refunds, rebates, reimbursements, checks returned for insufficient funds, proceeds of loans and other similar amounts.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Surplus.</E> If the Commission determines that a portion of payments from the Fund remains unspent after all qualified campaign expenses have been paid, it shall so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay the United States Treasury that portion of surplus funds.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Income on investment or other use of payments from the Fund.</E> If the Commission determines that a candidate received any income as a result of an investment or other use of payments from the fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.5, it shall so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to the amount determined to be income, less any Federal, State or local taxes on such income.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Unlawful acceptance of contributions by an eligible candidate of a major party.</E> If the Commission determines that an eligible candidate of a major <PRTPAGE P="296"/>party, the candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) accepted contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses (other than contributions to make up deficiencies in payments from the Fund, or to defray expenses incurred for legal and accounting services in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)), it shall notify the candidate of the amount of contributions so accepted, and the candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to such amount.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Repayment determination procedures.</E> The Commission's repayment determination will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Repayment determination.</E> The Commission will provide the candidate with a written notice of its repayment determination(s). This notice will be included in the Commission's audit report prepared pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(d) and will set forth the legal and factual reasons for such determination(s), as well as the evidence upon which any such determination is based. The candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the amount which the Commission has determined to be repayable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Administrative review of repayment determination.</E> If a candidate disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s), he or she may request an administrative review of the determination(s) as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Submission of written materials.</E> A candidate who disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s) shall submit in writing, within 60 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, legal and factual materials demonstrating that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires. The candidate's failure to timely raise an issue in written materials presented pursuant to this paragraph will be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to raise the issue at any future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9011(a).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> A candidate who submits written materials pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may at the same time request in writing that the Commission provide such candidate with an opportunity to address the Commission in open session to demonstrate that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. The candidate should identify in this request the repayment issues he or she wants to address at the oral hearing. If the Commission decides by an affirmative vote of four (4) of its members to grant the candidate's request, it will inform the candidate of the date and time set for the oral hearing. At the date and time set by the Commission, the candidate or candidate's designated representative will be allotted an amount of time in which to make an oral presentation to the Commission based upon the legal and factual materials submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The candidate or representative will also have the opportunity to answer any questions from individual members of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Repayment determination upon review.</E> In deciding whether to revise any repayment determination(s) following an administrative review pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commission will consider any submission made under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and any oral hearing conducted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and may also consider any new or additional information from other sources. A determination following an administrative review that a candidate must repay a certain amount will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons supporting the Commission's determination(s). This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination(s) and will summarize the results of any investigation(s) upon which the determination(s) are based.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Repayment period.</E> (1) Within 90 calendar days of service of the notice of the Commission's repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 <PRTPAGE P="297"/>calendar days in which to make repayment.</P>
            <P>(2) If the candidate requests an administrative review of the Commission's repayment determination(s) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission has concluded its administrative review of the repayment determination(s). Within 30 calendar days after service of the notice of the Commission's post-administrative review repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.</P>
            <P>(3) Interest shall be assessed on all repayments made after the initial 90-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the 30-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The amount of interest due shall be the greater of:</P>
            <P>(i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b); or</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional repayments.</E> Nothing in this section will prevent the Commission from making additional repayment determinations on one or more of the bases set forth at 11 CFR 9007.2(b) after it has made a repayment determination on any such basis. The Commission may make additional repayment determinations where there exist facts not used as the basis for any previous determination. Any such additional repayment determination will be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Newly-discovered assets.</E> If, after any repayment determination made under this section, a candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) receives or becomes aware of assets not previously included in any statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall promptly notify the Commission of such newly-discovered assets. Newly-discovered assets may include refunds, rebates, late-arriving receivables, and actual receipts for capital assets in excess of the value specified in any previously-submitted statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses. Newly-discovered assets may serve as a basis for additional repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2(f).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Limit on repayment.</E> No repayment shall be required from the eligible candidates of a political party under 11 CFR 9007.2 to the extent that such repayment, when added to other repayments required from such candidates under 11 CFR 9007.2, exceeds the amount of payments received by such candidates under 11 CFR 9005.2.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing; stays pending appeal.</E> The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(a). The candidate may request a stay of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(c) pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Extensions of time.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time under 11 CFR part 9007 will not be routinely granted.</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever a candidate has a right or is required to take action within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part 9007 or by notice given thereunder, the candidate may apply in writing to the Commission for an extension of time in which to exercise such right or take such action. The candidate shall demonstrate in the application for extension that good cause exists for his or her request.</P>

            <P>(c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 calendar days prior to the expiration of the time period for which the extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an extension of time to a candidate who has applied for such extension in a timely <PRTPAGE P="298"/>manner. The length of time of any extension granted hereunder shall be decided by the Commission and may be less than the amount of time sought by the candidate in his or her application. If a candidate seeks an extension of any 60-day response period under 11 CFR part 9007, the Commission may grant no more than one extension to that candidate, which extension shall not exceed 15 days.</P>
            <P>(d) If a candidate fails to seek an extension of time, exercise a right or take a required action prior to the expiration of a time period prescribed by 11 CFR part 9007, the Commission may, on the candidate's showing of excusable neglect:</P>
            <P>(1) Permit such candidate to exercise his or her right(s), or take such required action(s) after the expiration of the prescribed time period; and</P>
            <P>(2) Take into consideration any information obtained in connection with the exercise of any such right or taking of any such action before making decisions or determinations under 11 CFR part 9007.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Petitions for rehearing; stays of repayment determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing.</E> (1) Following the Commission's repayment determination or a final determination that a candidate is not entitled to all or a portion of post-election funding under 11 CFR 9004.9(f), the candidate may file a petition for rehearing setting forth the relief desired and the legal and factual basis in support. To be considered by the Commission, petitions for rehearing must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be filed within 20 calendar days following service of the Commission's repayment determination or final determination;</P>
            <P>(ii) Raise new questions of law or fact that would materially alter the Commission's repayment determination or final determination; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Set forth clear and convincing grounds why such questions were not and could not have been presented during the original determination process.</P>
            <P>(2) If a candidate files a timely petition under this section challenging a Commission repayment determination, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission serves notice on the candidate of its determination on the petition. The time periods for making repayment under 11 CFR 9007.2(d) shall apply to any amounts determined to be repayable following the Commission's consideration of a petition for rehearing under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of failure to raise issues.</E> The candidate's failure to raise an argument in a timely fashion during the original determination process or in a petition for rehearing under this section, as appropriate, shall be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to present such arguments in any future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9011(a). An issue is not timely raised in a petition for rehearing if it could have been raised earlier in response to the Commission's original determination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Stay of repayment determination pending appeal.</E> (1)(i) The candidate may apply to the Commission for a stay of all or a portion of the amount determined to be repayable under this section or under 11 CFR 9007.2 pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9011(a). The repayment amount requested to be stayed shall not exceed the amount at issue on appeal.</P>
            <P>(ii) A request for a stay shall be made in writing and shall be filed within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's decision on a petition for rehearing under paragraph (a) of this section or, if no petition for rehearing is filed, within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 9007.2(c).</P>

            <P>(2) The Commission's approval of a stay request will be conditioned upon <PRTPAGE P="299"/>the candidate's presentation of evidence in the stay request that he or she:</P>
            <P>(i) Has placed the entire amount at issue in a separate interest-bearing account pending the outcome of the appeal and that withdrawals from the account may only be made with the joint signatures of the candidate or his or her agent and a Commission representative; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Has posted a surety bond guaranteeing payment of the entire amount at issue plus interest; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Has met the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(A) He or she will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a stay; and, if so, that</P>
            <P>(B) He or she has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success on the merits of the judicial action.</P>
            <P>(C) Such relief is consistent with the public interest; and</P>
            <P>(D) No other party interested in the proceedings would be substantially harmed by the stay.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining whether the candidate has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success on the merits under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the Commission may consider whether the issue on appeal presents a novel or admittedly difficult legal question and whether the equities of the case suggest that the status quo should be maintained.</P>
            <P>(4) All stays shall require the payment of interest on the amount at issue. The amount of interest due shall be calculated from the date 30 days after service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(4) and shall be the greater of:</P>
            <P>(i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this section.</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Net outstanding convention expenses.</E> A convention committee that is eligible to receive payments under 11 CFR 9008.3 shall file, no later than sixty days after the last day of the convention, a statement of that committee's net outstanding convention expenses. The convention committee shall file a revised statement of net outstanding convention expenses which shall reflect the financial position of the convention committee as of the end of the ninth month following the last day of the convention. The revised statement shall be filed no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the ninth month following the last day of the convention, and shall be accompanied by the interim repayment, if required under 11 CFR 9008.12(b)(5)(ii).

              <P>(3) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding convention obligations under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall not include any accounts payable for non-convention expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated to be required as a repayment under 11 CFR 9008.12 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9008.14(c).</P>

A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee, which shall include a brief description of each capital asset, the purchase price, the date it was acquired, the method of disposition and the amount received in disposition. The fair market value of capital assets may be considered to be the total original cost of such items when acquired less 40%, to account for depreciation. If the committee wishes to claim a higher depreciation percentage for an item, it must list that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrate, through documentation, the fair market value of each such asset.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Other assets.</E> The term <E T="03">other assets</E> means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for loans. “Other assets” <PRTPAGE P="310"/>must be included on the committee's statement of net outstanding convention expenses if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item as of 45 days after the last day of the convention, unless the item is acquired after this date, in which case the item shall be valued on the date it is acquired. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee, which shall include a brief description of each such asset, the fair market value of each asset, the method of disposition and the amount received in disposition.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collectibility of accounts receivable.</E> If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how the lesser amount or full write-off was determined.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Winding down costs.</E> The term <E T="03">winding down costs</E> means:</P>
              <P>(i) Costs associated with the termination of the convention such as complying with the post-convention requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the convention, including office space rental, staff salaries and office supplies; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Costs incurred by the convention committee prior to 45 days after the last day of the convention for which written arrangements or commitment was made on or before that date.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Review of convention committee statement.</E> The Commission will review the statement filed by each convention committee under this section. The Commission may request further information with respect to statements filed pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.10 during the audit of that committee under 11 CFR 9008.11.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Production of computer information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Categories of computerized information to be provided.</E> If the convention committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the categories of data listed in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(iv) of this section, the committee shall provide computerized magnetic media, such as magnetic tapes or magnetic diskettes, containing the computerized information at the times specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Information required by law to be maintained regarding the committee's receipts or disbursements;</P>
              <P>(ii) Records used to reconcile bank statements;</P>
              <P>(iii) Records relating to the acquisition, use and disposition of capital assets; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Any other information that may be used during the Commission's audit to review the committee's receipts, disbursements, loans, debts, obligations, or bank reconciliations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time for Production.</E> If the committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data listed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the Commission generally will request such information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such request. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request additional or updated computerized information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously provided. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional computerized information which was created by or becomes available to the committee that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the Commission's request.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Organization of computerized information and technical specifications.</E> The computerized magnetic media shall be prepared and delivered at the committee's expense and shall conform to the technical specifications, including file requirements, described in the Federal Election Commission's Computerized <PRTPAGE P="311"/>Magnetic Media Requirements for Title 26 Candidates/Committees Receiving Federal Funding. The data contained in the computerized magnetic media provided to the Commission shall be organized in the order specified by the Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Additional materials and assistance.</E> Upon request, the committee shall produce documentation explaining the computer system's software capabilities, such as user guides, technical manuals, formats, layouts and other materials for processing and analyzing the information request. Upon request, the committee shall also make available such personnel as are necessary to explain the operation of the computer system's software and the computerized information prepared or maintained by the committee.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A national committee that has received payments from the Fund under 11 CFR part 9008 shall pay the United States Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable under this section. In making repayment determinations under this section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.11 or otherwise obtained by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commission will notify the committee of any repayment determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not later than 3 years after the last day of the Presidential nominating convention. The Commission's issuance of an audit report to the committee will constitute notification for purposes of the three year period.</P>
              <P>(3) Once the committee receives notice of the Commission's final repayment determination under this section, the committee should give preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of the committee, except for any federal taxes owed by the committee.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Bases for repayment.</E> The Commission may determine that the national committee of a political party that has received payments from the Fund must repay the United States Treasury under any of the circumstances described below.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Excess payments.</E> If the Commission determines that any portion of the payments to the national committee or convention committee under 11 CFR 9008.6(b) was in excess of the aggregate payments to which the national committee was entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5, it shall so notify the national committee, and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to such portion.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Excessive expenditures.</E> If the Commission determines that the national committee or convention committee incurred convention expenses in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR 9008.8(a), it shall notify the national committee of the amount of such excessive expenditures, and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Excessive contributions.</E> If the Commission determines that the national committee accepted contributions to defray convention expenses which, when added to the amount of payments received, exceeds the expenditure limitation of such party, it shall notify the national committee of the amount of the contributions so accepted, and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Improper usage or documentation.</E> If the Commission determines that any amount of any payment to the national committee or convention committee under 11 CFR 9008.6(b) was used for any <PRTPAGE P="312"/>purposes other than the purposes authorized at 11 CFR 9008.7 or was not documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9008.10, it shall notify the national committee of the amount improperly used or documented and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Unspent funds.</E> (i) If any portion of the payment under 11 CFR 9008.4 remains unspent after all convention expenses have been paid, that portion shall be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury.</P>
              <P>(ii) The national committee or convention committee shall make an interim repayment of unspent funds based on the financial position of the committee as of the end of the ninth month following the last day of the convention, allowing for a reasonable amount as determined by the Commission to be withheld for unanticipated contingencies. The interim repayment shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the ninth month following the last day of the convention. If, after written request by the national committee or convention committee, the Commission determines, upon review of evidence presented by either committee, that amounts previously refunded are needed to defray convention expenses, the Commission shall certify such amount for payment.</P>
              <P>(iii) All unspent funds shall be repaid to the U.S. Treasury no later than 24 months after the last day of the convention, unless the national committee has been granted an extension of time. The Commission may grant any extension of time it deems appropriate upon request of the national committee.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Income on investments of payments from the Fund.</E> If the Commission determines that the national committee or the convention committee received any income as a result of investment or other use of payments from the Fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(5), it shall so notify the committee and the committee shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to the amount determined to be income, less any Federal, State or local taxes on such income.</P>
              <P>(7) The Commission may seek repayment, or may initiate an enforcement action, if the convention committee knowingly helps, assists or participates in the making of a convention expenditure by the host committee, government agency or municipal fund that is not in accordance with 11 CFR 9008.52 or 9008.53, or the acceptance of a contribution by the host committee or government agency or municipal fund from an impermissible source.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Repayment determination procedures.</E> The Commission will follow the same repayment determination procedures, and the committee has the same rights and obligations as are provided for repayment determinations involving publicly funded candidates under 11 CFR 9007.2 (c) through (h).</P>

              <P>(b) Whenever a committee has a right or is required to take action within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part 9008 or by notice given thereunder, <PRTPAGE P="313"/>the committee may apply in writing to the Commission for an extension of time in which to exercise such right or take such action. The committee shall demonstrate in the application for extension that good cause exists for its request.</P>
              <P>(c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 calendar days prior to the expiration of the time period for which the extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an extension of time to a committee that has applied for such extension in a timely manner. The length of time of any extension granted hereunder shall be decided by the Commission and may be less than the amount of time sought by the committee in its application.</P>
              <P>(d) If a committee fails to seek an extension of time, exercise a right or take a required action prior to the expiration of a time period prescribed by 11 CFR part 9008, the Commission may, on the committee's showing of excusable neglect:</P>
              <P>(1) Permit such committee to exercise its right(s), or take such required action(s) after the expiration of the prescribed time period; and</P>
              <P>(2) Take into consideration any information obtained in connection with the exercise of any such right or taking of any such action before making decisions or determinations under 11 CFR part 9008.</P>

            <P>(9) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) will prepare matching fund submissions in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order.</P>

            <P>(10) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) will comply with the applicable requirements of 52 U.S.C. 30101 <E T="03">et seq.;</E> 26 U.S.C. 9031 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and the Commission's regulations at 11 CFR parts 100-300, and 9031-9039.</P>

The candidate may submit the letter containing the required certifications at any time after January 1 of the year immediately preceding the Presidential election year.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission will not consider a candidate's threshold submission until the candidate has submitted candidate certifications that meet the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certifications.</E> (1) The candidate shall certify that he or she is seeking nomination by a political party to the Office of President in more than one State. For purposes of this section, in order for a candidate to be deemed to be seeking nomination by a political party to the office of President, the party whose nomination the candidate seeks must have a procedure for holding a primary election, as defined in 11 CFR 9032.7, for nomination to that office. For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">political party</E> means an association, committee or organization which nominates an individual for election to the office of President. The fact that an association, committee or organization qualifies as a political party under this section does not affect the party's status as a national political party for purposes of 52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(1)(B) and 30116(a)(2)(B).</P>
            <P>(2) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall certify that they have not incurred and will not incur expenditures in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination, which expenditures are in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035.</P>
            <P>(3) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall certify:</P>
            <P>(i) That they have received matchable contributions totaling more than $5,000 in each of at least 20 States; and</P>
            <P>(ii) That the matchable contributions are from individuals who are residents of the State for which their contributions are submitted.</P>
            <P>(iii) A maximum of $250 of each individual's aggregate contributions will be considered as matchable contributions for the purpose of meeting the thresholds of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) For purposes of this section, contributions of an individual who maintains residences in more than one State may only be counted toward the $5,000 threshold for the State from which the earliest contribution was made by that contributor.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Threshold submission.</E> To become eligible to receive matching payments, the candidate shall submit documentation of the contributions described in 11 CFR 9033.2(b)(3) to the Commission for review. The submission shall follow the format and requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1.</P>

The candidate may, within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, satisfy the threshold requirements or submit in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she has satisfied those requirements. A final determination by the Commission that the candidate has failed to satisfy threshold requirements will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>
            <P>(b) The Commission will make its examination and determination under this section as soon as practicable. During the Presidential election year, the Commission will generally complete its review and make its determination within 15 business days.</P>

            <P>The candidate's date of ineligibility shall be whichever date by operation of 11 CFR 9033.5 (a), (b), or (c) occurs first. After the candidate's date of ineligibility, he or she may only receive matching payments to the extent that he or she has net outstanding campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Inactive candidate.</E> The ineligibility date shall be the day on which an individual ceases to be a candidate because he or she is not actively conducting campaigns in more than one State in connection with seeking the Presidential nomination. This date shall be the earliest of—</P>
            <P>(1) The date the candidate publicly announces that he or she will not be actively conducting campaigns in more than one State; or</P>
            <P>(2) The date the candidate notifies the Commission by letter that he or she is not actively conducting campaigns in more than one State; or</P>
            <P>(3) The date which the Commission determines under 11 CFR 9033.6 to be the date that the candidate is not actively seeking election in more than one State.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Insufficient votes.</E> The ineligibility date shall be the 30th day following the date of the second consecutive primary election in which such individual receives less than 10 percent of the number of popular votes cast for all candidates of the same party for the same office in that primary election, if the candidate permitted or authorized his or her name to appear on the ballot, unless the candidate certifies to the Commission at least 25 business days prior to the primary that he or she will not be an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
            <P>(1) The Commission may refuse to accept the candidate's certification if it determines under 11 CFR 9033.7 that the candidate is an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this paragraph, if the candidate is running in two primary elections in different States on the same date, the highest percentage of votes the candidate receives in any one State will govern. Separate primary elections held in more than one State on the same date are not deemed to be consecutive primaries. If two primary elections are held on the same date in the same State (e.g., a primary to select delegates to a national nominating convention and a primary for the expression of preference for the nomination of candidates for election to the office of President), the highest percentage of votes a candidate receives in either election will govern. If two or more primaries are held in the same State on different dates, the earliest primary will govern.</P>

            <P>(3) If the candidate certifies that he or she will not be an active candidate in a particular primary, and the Commission accepts the candidate's certification, the primary involved shall not be counted in determining the candidate's date of ineligibility under <PRTPAGE P="324"/>paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of the percentage of popular votes cast for the candidate in that primary.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">End of matching payment period.</E> The ineligibility date shall be the last day of the matching payment period for the candidate as specified in 11 CFR 9032.6.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of inactive candidacy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission may, on the basis of the factors listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b) below, make a determination that a candidate is no longer actively seeking nomination for election in more than one State. Upon a final determination by the Commission that a candidate is inactive, that candidate will become ineligible as provided in 11 CFR 9033.5.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors considered.</E> In making its determination of inactive candidacy, the Commission may consider, but is not limited to considering, the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) The frequency and type of public appearances, speeches, and advertisements;</P>
            <P>(2) Campaign activity with respect to soliciting contributions or making expenditures for campaign purposes;</P>
            <P>(3) Continued employment of campaign personnel or the use of volunteers;</P>
            <P>(4) The release of committed delegates;</P>

            <P>(6) The candidate urges supporters to support another candidate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b) and will advise the candidate of the date on which active campaigning in more than one State ceased. The candidate may, within 15 business days after service of the Commission's notice, submit in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she is actively campaigning in more than one State.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> A final determination of inactive candidacy will be made by the Commission in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>

            <P>(b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination within 10 business days of receiving the candidate's certification under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) or, if the timing of the activity does not permit notice during the 10 day period, as soon as practicable following campaign activity by the candidate in the primary state. The Commission's initial determination will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). Within 10 business days after service of the Commission's notice the candidate may submit, in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b), written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she is not an active candidate in the primary involved.</P>
            <P>(c) A final determination by the Commission that the candidate is active will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Candidates found to be inactive.</E> A candidate who has become ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5(a) on the basis that he or she is not actively campaigning in more than one State may reestablish eligibility for matching payments by submitting to the Commission evidence of active campaigning in more than one State. In determining whether the candidate has reestablished eligibility, the Commission will consider, but is not limited to considering, the <PRTPAGE P="325"/>factors listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b). The day the Commission determines to be the day the candidate becomes active again will be the date on which eligibility is reestablished.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> If the Commission makes an initial determination that a candidate may not receive matching funds for one or more of the reasons indicated in 11 CFR 9033.10(a), the Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination.

This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation upon which the determination is based.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect on other determinations.</E> If the Commission makes an initial determination under this section, but decides to take no further action at that time, the Commission may use the legal and factual bases on which the initial determination was based in any future repayment determination under 11 CFR part 9038 or 9039. A determination by the Commission under this section may be independent of any Commission decision to institute an enforcement proceeding under 52 U.S.C. 30109.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing.</E> Following a final determination under this section, the candidate may file a petition for rehearing in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a).</P>

            <P>(c) A contract, promise, or agreement, whether or not legally enforceable, such as a pledge card to make a contribution for any such purposes (but a gift of money by written instrument is not rendered unmatchable solely because the contribution was preceded by a promise or pledge);</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Qualified campaign expenses</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all contributions received by an individual from the date he or she becomes a candidate and all matching payments received by the candidate shall be used only to defray qualified campaign expenses or to repay loans or otherwise restore funds (other than contributions which were received and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses), which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing the waters.</E> Even though incurred prior to the date an individual becomes a candidate, payments made in accordance with the 11 CFR 100.131(a) for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate shall be considered qualified campaign expenses if the individual subsequently becomes a candidate and shall count against that candidate's limits under 52 U.S.C. 30116(b).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Winding down costs and continuing to campaign.</E> (i) Winding down costs subject to the restrictions in 11 CFR 9034.11 shall be considered qualified campaign expenses.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the candidate continues to campaign after becoming ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b), the candidate may only receive matching funds based on net outstanding campaign obligations as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. The statement of net outstanding campaign obligations shall only include costs incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received before the date of ineligibility and for which written arrangement or commitment <PRTPAGE P="332"/>was made on or before the candidate's date of ineligibility, and shall not include winding down costs until the date on which the candidate qualifies to receive winding down costs under 11 CFR 9034.11. Each contribution that is dated after the candidate's date of ineligibility may be used to continue to campaign, and may be submitted for matching fund payments. Payments from the matching payment account that are received after the candidate's date of ineligibility may be used to defray the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, but shall not be used to defray any costs associated with continuing to campaign unless the candidate reestablishes eligibility under 11 CFR 9033.8.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Taxes.</E> Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. These expenses shall not, however, count against the state or overall expenditure limits of 11 CFR 9035.1(a).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Monetary bonuses paid after the date of ineligibility and gifts.</E> Monetary bonuses paid after the date of ineligibility and gifts shall be considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) All monetary bonuses paid after the date of ineligibility for committee employees and consultants in recognition of campaign-related activities or services:</P>

            <P>(B) Are paid no later than thirty days after the date of ineligibility; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Gifts for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition of campaign-related activities or services do not exceed $150 total per individual and the total of all gifts does not exceed $20,000.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Expenses incurred by ineligible candidates attending national nominating conventions.</E> Expenses incurred by an ineligible candidate to attend, participate in, or conduct activities at a national nominating convention may be treated as qualified campaign expenses, but such convention-related expenses shall not exceed a total of $50,000.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-qualified campaign expenses</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Excessive expenditures.</E> An expenditure which is in excess of any of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035 shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures attributable to the limitations in accordance with 11 CFR 9035.1(a)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">General election and post-ineligibility expenditures.</E> Except for winding down costs pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section and certain convention expenses described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, any expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, are not qualified campaign expenses. In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Civil or criminal penalties.</E> Civil or criminal penalties paid pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from contributions or matching payments. Any amounts received or expended to pay such penalties shall not be considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and expended under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 104.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Payments to candidate.</E> Payments made to the candidate by his or her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Payments to other authorized committees.</E> Payments, including transfers and loans, to other committees authorized by the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Allocable expenses.</E> Payments for expenses subject to state allocation under 11 CFR 106.2 are not qualified <PRTPAGE P="333"/>campaign expenses if the records retained are not sufficient to permit allocation to any state, such as the failure to keep records of the date on which the expense is incurred.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Lost, misplaced, or stolen items.</E> The cost of lost, misplaced, or stolen items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; whether the committee sought or obtained insurance on the items; whether the committee filed a police report; the type of equipment involved; and the number and value of items that were lost.</P>
            <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfers to other campaigns</E>—(1) <E T="03">Other Federal offices.</E> If a candidate has received matching funds and is simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office, no transfer of funds between his or her principal campaign committees or authorized committees may be made. See 52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(5)(C) and 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5) and 110.8(d). A candidate will be considered to be simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office if he or she is seeking nomination or election to such Federal office under 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">General election.</E> If a candidate has received matching funds, all transfers from the candidate's primary election account to a legal and accounting compliance fund established for the general election must be made in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(1).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Attribution of expenditures between the primary and the general election spending limits.</E> The following rules apply to candidates who receive public funding in either the primary or the general election, or both.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Any expenditure for goods or services that are used for the primary election campaign, other than those listed in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(7) of this section, shall be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1. Any expenditure for goods or services that are used for the general election campaign, other than those listed in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(7) of this section, shall be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(a)(2), as adjusted under 11 CFR 110.17(a).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Polling expenses.</E> Polling expenses shall be attributed according to when the results of the poll are received. If the results are received on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the expenses shall be considered primary election expenses. If results are received from a single poll both before and after the date of the candidate's nomination, the costs shall be allocated between the primary and the general election limits based on the percentage of results received during each period.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">State or national campaign offices.</E> Prior to the date of the last primary election in a Presidential election year, overhead and salary costs incurred in connection with state or national campaign offices shall be attributed to the primary election. With regard to overhead and salary costs incurred on or after June 1 of the Presidential election year, but before or on the date of nomination, the committee may attribute to the general election an amount not to exceed 15% of the limitation on primary-election expenditures set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(a)(1). Overhead and payroll costs associated with winding down the campaign and compliance activities shall be governed by paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Campaign materials.</E> Expenditures for campaign materials, including bumper stickers, campaign brochures, buttons, pens and similar items, that are purchased by the primary election campaign committee and later transferred to and used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the general election limits. Materials transferred to but not used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the primary election limits.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Media production costs.</E> For media communications that are broadcast or published both before and after the date of the candidate's nomination, 50% of the media production costs shall be attributed to the primary election limits, and 50% to the general election limits. Distribution costs, including such costs as air time and advertising space in newspapers, shall be paid for <PRTPAGE P="334"/>100% by the primary or general election campaign depending on when the communication is broadcast or distributed.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Campaign communications.</E> (i) <E T="03">Solicitations and fundraising costs.</E> The costs of fundraising, including that of events and solicitation costs, shall be attributed to the primary election or to the GELAC, depending on the purposes of the fundraising. If a candidate raises funds for both the primary election and for the GELAC in a single communication or through a single fundraising event, the allocation of fundraising costs and the distribution of net proceeds will be made in the same manner as described in 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(8)(i) and (ii).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other communications.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the costs of a campaign communication that does not include a solicitation shall be attributed to the primary or general election limits based on the date on which the communication is broadcast, published or mailed. The cost of a communication that is broadcast, published or mailed before the date of the candidate's nomination shall be attributed to the primary election limits.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Travel costs.</E> Expenditures for campaign-related transportation, food, and lodging by any individual, including a candidate, shall be attributed according to when the travel occurs. If the travel occurs on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the cost is a primary election expense. Travel to and from the convention shall be attributed to the primary election. Travel by a person who is working exclusively on general election campaign preparations shall be considered a general election expense even if the travel occurs before the candidate's nomination.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Net outstanding campaign obligations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Within 15 calendar days after the candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, the candidate shall submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations under this section equal the difference between paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) The total of all outstanding obligations for qualified campaign expenses as of the candidate's date of ineligibility as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, plus estimated necessary winding down costs as defined under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3), less</P>
            <P>(2) The total of:</P>
            <P>(i) Cash on hand as of the close of business on the last day of eligibility (including all contributions dated on or before that date whether or not submitted for matching; currency; balances on deposit in banks; savings and loan institutions; and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any other committee investments valued at fair market value);</P>
            <P>(ii) The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on hand; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Amounts owed to the committee in the form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates of qualified campaign expenses; or a commercially reasonable amount based on the collectibility of those credits, returns, receivables or rebates.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Liabilities.</E> (1) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not include any accounts payable for non-qualified campaign expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated to be required as repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.</P>

            <P>(2) The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be broken down by expense category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, legal expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in <PRTPAGE P="335"/>each category from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity.</P>
            <P>(c) (1) <E T="03">Capital assets.</E> For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">capital assets</E> means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when received by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include property defined as “other assets” under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Capital assets include items such as computer systems and telecommunications systems, if the equipment is used together and if the total cost of all components that are used together exceeds $2000. A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be 60% of the total original cost of such items when acquired, except that items received after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date received. A candidate may claim a lower fair market value for a capital asset by listing that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrating, through documentation, the lower fair market value. If the candidate receives public funding for the general election, a lower fair market value shall not be claimed under this section for any capital assets transferred or sold to the candidate's general election committee.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other assets.</E> The term <E T="03">other assets</E> means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign loans. “Other assets” must be included on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item on the candidate's date of ineligibility or on the date the item is acquired if acquired after the date of ineligibility. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d)(2).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Collectibility of accounts receivable.</E> If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how the lesser amount or full writeoff was determined.</P>
            <P>(e) Contributions received from joint fundraising activities conducted under 11 CFR 9034.8 may be used to pay a candidate's outstanding campaign obligations.</P>
            <P>(1) Such contributions shall be deemed monies available to pay outstanding campaign obligations as of the date these funds are received by the fundraising representative committee and shall be included in the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations.</P>
            <P>(2) The amount of money deemed available to pay a candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations will equal either—</P>
            <P>(i) An amount calculated on the basis of the predetermined allocation formula, as adjusted for 52 U.S.C. 30116 limitations; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If a candidate receives an amount greater than that calculated under 11 CFR 9034.5(e)(2)(i), the amount actually received.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) With each submission for matching fund payments filed after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the candidate shall certify that, as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date of submission for matching funds, his or her remaining net outstanding campaign obligations equal or exceed the amount submitted for matching.</P>

            <P>(2) A candidate who makes a submission for matching fund payments after his or her date of ineligibility shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. <PRTPAGE P="336"/>This revised statement shall be due before the next regularly scheduled payment date, on a date to be determined and published by the Commission. This statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business three business days before the due date of the statement. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's assets and obligations from the previous statement.</P>
            <P>(3) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the candidate shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date to be determined and published by the commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date.</P>
            <P>(g)(1) If the Commission receives information indicating that substantial assets of the candidate's authorized committee(s) have been undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of outstanding campaign obligations has been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily suspend further matching payments pending a final determination whether the candidate is entitled to receive all or a portion of the matching funds requested.</P>
            <P>(2) In making a determination under 11 CFR 9034.5(g)(1), the Commission will follow the procedures for initial and final determinations under 11 CFR 9033.10 (b) and (c). The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination within 15 business days after receipt of the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. Within 15 business days after service of the Commission's notice, the candidate may submit written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she has net outstanding campaign obligations that entitle the campaign to further matching payments.</P>
            <P>(3) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding campaign obligations still exceeds committee assets, he or she may continue to receive matching payments.</P>
            <P>(4) Following a final determination under this section, the candidate may file a petition for rehearing in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a).</P>

            <P>(2) Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, committees may seek reimbursement from the media for the expenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and may deduct reimbursements received from media representatives from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation of 11 CFR 9035.1(a). Expenses for which the committee receives no reimbursement will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, with the exception of those expenses relating to Secret Service personnel and national security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitation.</P>
            <P>(3) Committees may seek reimbursement from the media only for the billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reimbursement limits; billing.</E> (1) The amount of reimbursement sought from a media representative under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 110% of the media representative's pro rata share (or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata share) of the actual cost of the transportation and <PRTPAGE P="337"/>services made available. Any reimbursement received in excess of this amount shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a media representative's pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the transportation and services provided by the total number of individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available. For purposes of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service personnel, national security staff and any other individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available, except that, when seeking reimbursement for transportation costs paid by the committee under 11 CFR 100.93 and 9034.7(b)(5)(i), the total number of individuals shall not include national security staff.</P>
            <P>(3) No later than sixty (60) days of the campaign trip or event, the committee shall provide each media representative attending the event with an itemized bill that specifies the amounts charged for air and ground transportation for each segment of the trip, housing, meals, telephone service, and other billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office. Payments shall be due sixty (60) days from the date of the bill, unless the media representative disputes the charges.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Deduction of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation.</E> (1) The Committee may deduct from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allocation of travel expenditures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 11 CFR 106.3, expenditures for travel relating to the campaign of a candidate seeking nomination for election to the office of President by any individual, including a candidate, shall, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, be qualified campaign expenses and be reported by the candidate's authorized committee(s) as expenditures.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.</P>
            <P>(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related stop and from that stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop, back to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.</P>
            <P>(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The itinerary shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of event held.</P>
            <P>(4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for Commission inspection. When required to be created, a copy of the government's or the charter company's official manifest shall also be maintained and made available by the committee.</P>
            <P>(5)(i) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government aircraft for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount not less than the applicable rate set forth in 11 CFR 100.93(e).</P>
            <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government conveyance, other than an aircraft, for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the amount required under 11 CFR 100.93(d).</P>
            <P>(iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, including lodging and meeting rooms, during campaign-related travel, and the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations, and shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.</P>
            <P>(v) For travel by aircraft, the committee shall maintain documentation as required by 11 CFR 100.93(j)(1) in addition to any other documentation required in this section. For travel by other conveyances, the committee shall maintain documentation of the commercial rental rate as required by 11 CFR 100.93(j)(3) in addition to any other documentation required in this section.</P>
            <P>(6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel may be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel expenses will be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures.</P>

            <P>(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, including <PRTPAGE P="339"/>the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes will be a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.</P>
            <P>(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the trips is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.</P>
            <P>(8) Non-commercial travel on aircraft, and travel on other means of transportation not operated for commercial passenger service is governed by 11 CFR 100.93.</P>

            <P>(ii) If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, the notice shall also contain a statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a participant receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Separate depository account.</E> (i) The participants or the fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint fundraising proceeds.

            <P>(7) <E T="03">Allocation of gross proceeds.</E> (i) The fundraising representative shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the fundraising agreement. Each contribution received shall be allocated among the participants in accordance with the allocation formula, unless the circumstances described in paragraphs (c)(7) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section apply. Funds may not be distributed or reallocated so as to maximize the matchability of the contributions.</P>
            <P>(ii) If distribution according to the allocation formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants or if distribution under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(b), the fundraising representative may reallocate the surplus funds. The fundraising representative shall not reallocate funds so as to allow candidates seeking to extinguish outstanding debts to rely on the receipt of matching funds to pay the remainder of their debts; rather, all funds to which a participant is entitled under the allocation formula shall be deemed funds available to pay the candidate's outstanding campaign obligations as provided in 11 CFR 9034.5(c).</P>
            <P>(iii) Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participant's proportionate shares under the allocation formula.

            <P>(iv) Earmarked contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated by the fundraising representative without the prior written permission of the contributor. A written instrument made payable to one of the participants shall be considered an earmarked contribution unless a written statement by the contributor indicates that it is intended for inclusion in the general proceeds of the fundraising activity.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds.</E> (i) If participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the same political party:</P>
            <P>(A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants under 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(7), the fundraising representative shall calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. To calculate each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.</P>

            <P>(B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110. See also 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(6).<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same throughout the series.</P>
            <P>(ii) If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a political committee.</P>
            <P>(iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the fundraising representative.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Reporting of receipts and disbursements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Reporting receipts.</E> (A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in the reporting period in which they are received.

Each participating political committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reporting disbursements.</E> The fundraising representative shall report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made. Each participant shall report in a memo Schedule B his or her total allocated share of these disbursements in the same reporting period in which net proceeds are distributed and reported and include the amount on page 4 of Form 3-P, under “Expenditures Subject to Limit.”</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Winding down costs. Winding down costs</E> are costs associated with the termination of political activity related to a candidate's seeking his or her nomination for election, such as the costs of complying with the post election requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies. Winding down costs are qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Winding down limitation.</E> The total amount of winding down costs that may be paid for, in whole or part, with matching funds shall not exceed the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(1) 10% of the overall expenditure limitation pursuant to 11 CFR 9035.1; or</P>
            <P>(2) 10% of the total of:</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Allocation of primary and general election winding down costs.</E> A candidate who runs in both the primary and general election may divide winding down expenses between his or her primary and general election committees using any reasonable allocation method. An allocation method is reasonable if it divides the total winding down costs between the primary and general election committees and results in no less than one third of total winding down costs allocated to each committee. A candidate may demonstrate than an allocation method is reasonable even if either the primary or the general election committee is allocated less than one third of total winding down costs.</P>

A primary election candidate who runs in the general election, regardless of whether the candidate receives public funds for the general election, must wait until 31 days after the general election before using any matching funds for winding down costs related to the primary election. No expenses incurred by a primary election candidate who runs in the general election prior to 31 days after the general election shall be considered primary winding down costs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Campaign expenditure limitation; compliance and fundraising exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Spending limit.</E> (1) No candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall knowingly incur expenditures in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination, which expenditures, in the aggregate, exceed $10,000,000 (as adjusted under 52 U.S.C. 30116(c)), except that the aggregate expenditures by a candidate in any one State shall not exceed the greater of: 16 cents (as adjusted under 52 U.S.C. 30116(c)) multiplied by the voting age population of the State (as certified under 52 U.S.C. 30116(e)); or $200,000 (as adjusted under 52 U.S.C. 30116(c)).</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures attributable to the overall expenditure limit or to a particular state using the full amounts originally charged for goods and services rendered to the committee and not the amounts for which such obligations were settled and paid, unless the committee can demonstrate that the lower amount paid reflects a reasonable settlement of a bona fide dispute with the creditor.</P>
            <P>(3) In addition to expenditures made by a candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) using campaign funds, the Commission will attribute to the candidate's overall expenditure limitation and to the expenditure limitations of particular states under 11 CFR 110.8 the total amount of all:</P>
            <P>(i) Coordinated expenditures under 11 CFR 109.20;</P>
            <P>(ii) Coordinated communications under 11 CFR 109.21 that are in-kind contributions received or accepted by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee(s), or agents, under 11 CFR 109.21(b);</P>
            <P>(iii) Coordinated party expenditures, including party coordinated communications pursuant to 11 CFR 109.37 that are in-kind contributions received or accepted by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee(s), or agents under 11 CFR 109.37(a)(3), and that exceed the coordinated party expenditure limitation for the Presidential general election at 11 CFR 109.32(a); and</P>
            <P>(iv) Other in-kind contributions received or accepted by the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) or agents.</P>
            <P>(4) The amount of each in-kind contribution attributed to the expenditure limitations under this section is the usual and normal charge for the goods or services provided to the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) as an in-kind contribution.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Allocation of expenditures.</E> Each candidate receiving or expecting to receive matching funds under this subchapter shall also allocate his or her expenditures in accordance with the provisions of 11 CFR 106.2.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance, fundraising and shortfall bridge loan exemptions.</E> (1) A candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation set forth in paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal to 15% of the overall expenditure limitation as exempt legal and accounting compliance costs under 11 CFR 100.146. In the case of a candidate who does not run in the general election, for purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in this section, 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. Candidates who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility may not treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred during the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses. For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in this section, candidates who run in the general election, regardless of whether they receive public funds, must wait until 31 days after the general election before they may treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer <PRTPAGE P="345"/>expenses as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses.</P>
            <P>(2) A candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation of 11 CFR 9035.1 the amount of exempt fundraising costs specified in 11 CFR 100.152(c).</P>
            <P>(3) If any matching funds to which the candidate is entitled are not paid to the candidate, or are paid after the date on which payment is due, the candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation in paragraph (a) of this section the amount of all interest charges that accrued during the shortfall period on all loans obtained by the candidate or authorized committee that are guaranteed or secured with matching funds, provided the candidate submits documentation as to the amount of all interest charges on such loans. The shortfall period begins on the first regularly scheduled payment date on which the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds and ends on the payment date when the candidate receives the previously certified matching funds or the date on which the Commission revises the amount previously certified to eliminate the entitlement to the previously certified matching funds.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Candidates not receiving matching funds.</E> The expenditure limitations of 11 CFR 9035.1 shall not apply to a candidate who does not receive matching funds at any time during the matching payment period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Limitation on expenditures from personal or family funds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) No candidate who has accepted matching funds shall knowingly make expenditures from his or her personal funds, or funds of his or her immediate family, in connection with his or her campaign for nomination for election to the office of President which exceed $50,000, in the aggregate. This section shall not operate to prohibit any member of the candidate's immediate family from contributing his or her personal funds to the candidate, subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. The provisions of this section also shall not limit the candidate's liability for, nor the candidate's ability to pay, any repayments required under 11 CFR part 9038. If the candidate or his or her committee knowingly incurs expenditures in excess of the limitations of 11 CFR 110.8(a), the Commission may seek civil penalties under 11 CFR part 111 in addition to any repayment determinations made on the basis of such excessive expenditures.</P>

            <P>(2) Expenditures made using a credit card for which the candidate is jointly or solely liable will count against the limits of this section to the extent that the full amount due, including any finance charge, is not paid by the committee within 60 days after the closing date of the billing statement on which the charges first appear. For purposes of this section, the <E T="03">closing date</E> shall be the date indicated on the billing statement which serves as the cutoff date for determining which charges are included on that billing statement.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">immediate family</E> means a candidate, spouse, and any child, parent, grandparent, brother, half-brother, sister, or half-sister of the candidate, and the spouses of such persons.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of this section, <E T="03">personal funds</E> has the same meaning as specified in 11 CFR 9003.2.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time for submission of threshold submission.</E> At any time after January 1 of the year immediately preceding the Presidential election year, the candidate may submit a threshold submission for matching fund payments in accordance with the format for such submissions set forth in 11 CFR 9036.1(b). The candidate may submit the threshold submission simultaneously with or subsequent to his or her submission of the candidate agreement and certifications required by 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Format for threshold submission.</E> (1) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she has met the requirements of the certifications in 11 CFR 9033.2(b), the candidate shall submit an alphabetical list of contributors showing:</P>
            <P>(i) Each contributor's full name and residential address;</P>

            <P>(vi) The aggregate amount of all matchable contributions from that contributor submitted for matching purposes;</P>
            <P>(vii) A notation indicating which contributions were received as a result of joint fundraising activities.</P>
            <P>(2) For each list of contributors generated directly or indirectly from computerized files or computerized records, the candidate shall submit computerized magnetic media, such as magnetic tapes or magnetic diskettes, containing the information required by 11 CFR 9036.1(b)(1) in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.12.</P>

            <P>(3) The candidate shall submit a full-size photocopy of each check or written instrument and of supporting documentation in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.2 for each contribution that the candidate submits to establish eligibility for matching funds. For purposes of the threshold submission, the photocopies shall be segregated alphabetically by contributor within each State, <PRTPAGE P="347"/>and shall be accompanied by and referenced to copies of the relevant deposit slips. In lieu of submitting photocopies, the candidate may submit digital images of checks and other materials in accordance with the procedures specified in 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1)(vi). Digital images of contributions do not need to be segregated alphabetically by contributor within each State.</P>
            <P>(4) The candidate shall submit bank documentation, such as bank-validated deposit slips or unvalidated deposit slips accompanied by the relevant bank statements, which indicate that the contributions submitted were deposited into a designated campaign depository.</P>

This listing shall be accompanied by a full-size photocopy of each unpaid check, and copies of the associated debit memo and bank statement.</P>
            <P>(6) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she has met the requirements to establish eligibility, the candidate shall submit a listing, in alphabetical order by contributor, of all contributions that were refunded to the contributor, regardless of whether the contributions were submitted for matching. For each refunded contribution, the listing shall state the contributor's full name and address, the deposit date and batch number, an indication of which matching fund submission the contribution was included in, if any, and the amount and date of the refund. The listing shall be accompanied by a full-sized photocopy of each refunded contributor check.</P>

            <P>(7) In the case of a contribution made by a credit or debit card, including one made over the Internet, the candidate shall provide sufficient documentation to the Commission to insure that each such contribution was made by a lawful contributor who manifested an intention to make the contribution to the candidate or authorized committee that submits it for matching fund payments. Additional information on the documentation required to accompany such contributions is found in the Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(9).</P>
            <P>(8) The candidate shall submit all contributions in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order.</P>
            <P>(9) Contributions that are not submitted in compliance with this section shall not count toward the threshold amount.</P>

            <P>(2) If the Commission makes a determination of a candidate's eligibility under 11 CFR 9036.1(a) in a Presidential election year, the Commission shall certify to the Secretary, within 10 calendar days after the Commission has made its determination, the amount to which the candidate is entitled.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Commission makes a determination of a candidate's eligibility under 11 CFR 9036.1(a) in the year preceding the Presidential election year, the Commission will notify the candidate that he or she is eligible to receive matching fund payments; however, the Commission's determination will not result in a payment of funds to the candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time for submission of additional submissions.</E> The candidate may submit additional submissions for payments to the Commission on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. On the last two submission dates in the year prior to the election year and on each submission date after the beginning of the matching payment period, the candidate may not make more <PRTPAGE P="348"/>than one additional submission, and either one resubmission under 11 CFR 9036.5 or one corrected submission under 11 CFR 9036.2(c) or (d)(2), as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Format for additional submissions.</E> The candidate may obtain additional matching fund payments subsequent to the Commission's threshold certification and payment of primary matching funds to the candidate by filing an additional submission for payment. All additional submissions for payments filed by the candidate shall be made in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order.</P>
            <P>(1) The first submission for matching funds following the candidate's threshold submission shall contain all the matchable contributions included in the threshold submission and any additional contributions to be submitted for matching in that submission. This submission shall contain all the information required for the threshold submission except that:</P>
            <P>(i) The candidate is not required to resubmit the candidate agreement and certifications of 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2;</P>
            <P>(ii) The candidate is required to submit an alphabetical list of contributors (either solely in magnetic media from or in both printed and magnetic media forms), but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission;</P>
            <P>(iii) The candidate is required to submit a listing, alphabetical by contributor, of all checks returned unpaid, but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission;</P>
            <P>(iv) The candidate is required to submit a listing, in alphabetical order by contributor, of all contributions refunded to the contributor but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission.</P>
            <P>(v) The occupation and employer's name need not be disclosed on the contributor list for individuals whose aggregate contributions exceed $200 in the election cycle, but such information is subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 52 U.S.C. 30102(c)(3), 30104(b)(3)(A) and 11 CFR 102.9(a)(2), 104.3(a)(4)(i); and</P>
            <P>(vi) The photocopies of each check or written instrument and of supporting documentation shall either be alphabetized and referenced to copies of the relevant deposit slip, but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission; or such photocopies may be batched in deposits of 50 contributions or less and cross-referenced by deposit number and sequence number within each deposit on the contributor list. In lieu of submitting photocopies, the candidate may submit digital images of checks, written instruments and deposit slips as specified in the Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements. The candidate may also submit digital images of contributor redesignations, reattributions and supporting statements and materials needed to verify the matchability of contributions. The candidate shall provide the computer equipment and software needed to retrieve and read the digital images, if necessary, at no cost to the Commission, and shall include digital images of every contribution received and imaged on or after the date of the previous matching fund request. Contributions and other documentation not imaged shall be submitted in photocopy form. The candidate shall maintain the originals of all contributor redesignations, reattributions and supporting statements and materials that are submitted for matching as digital images.</P>

            <P>(vii) In the case of a contribution made by a credit or debit card, including one made over the Internet, the candidate shall provide sufficient documentation to the Commission to insure that each such contribution was made by a lawful contributor who manifested an intention to make the contribution to the candidate or authorized committee that submits it for matching fund payments. Additional information on the documentation required to accompany such contributions is found in the Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. <E T="03">See</E> 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(9).</P>

            <P>(2) Following the first submission under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), candidates may request additional matching funds on dates prescribed by the Commission by making a full submission as required under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1). The amount requested for matching may include contributions received up to <PRTPAGE P="349"/>the last business day preceding the date of the request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional submissions submitted in non-Presidential election year.</E> The candidate may submit additional contributions for review during the year preceding the presidential election year; however, the amount of each submission made during this period must exceed $50,000. Additional submissions filed by a candidate in a non-Presidential election year will not result in payment of matching funds to the candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year. If the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of the amount requested, the procedures described in 11 CFR 9036.2(d)(2) shall apply, unless the submission was made on the last submission date in December of the year before the Presidential election year.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of additional payments by Commission.</E> (1) When a candidate who is eligible under 11 CFR 9033.4 submits an additional submission for payment in the Presidential election year, and before the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review the additional submission and will certify to the Secretary at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b). See 11 CFR 9036.4 for Commission procedures for certification of additional payments.</P>
            <P>(2) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review each additional submission and resubmission, and will certify to the Secretary, at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the ineligible candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b), unless the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions contained in the submission or resubmission exceeds 15% of the amount requested. In the latter case, the Commission will return the additional submission or resubmission to the candidate and request that it be corrected, unless the resubmission was made on the last date for resubmissions in September of the year following the Presidential election year. Corrected submissions and resubmissions will be reviewed by the Commission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.4 and 9036.5. Submissions and resubmissions will not be considered to be corrected unless the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions has been reduced to no more than 15% of the amount requested.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Commission review of submissions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Non-acceptance of submission for review of matchability.</E> (1) The Commission will make an initial review of each submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 to determine if it substantially meets the format requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2(b) and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. If the Commission determines that a submission does not substantially meet these requirements, it will not review the matchability of the contributions contained therein.</P>
            <P>(2) For submissions made in the year before the Presidential election year (other than submissions made on the last submission date in that year), and submissions made after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will stop reviewing the submission once the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of the amount requested, as provided in 11 CFR 9036.2 (c) or (d), as applicable.</P>
            <P>(3) Under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the Commission will return the submission to the candidate and request that it be corrected in accordance with the applicable requirements. If the candidate makes a corrected submission within 5 business days after the Commission's return of the original, the Commission will review the corrected submission prior to the next regularly scheduled submission date, and will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the candidate is entitled on the regularly scheduled certification date for the original submission. Corrected submissions made after this five-day period will be reviewed subsequent to the next regularly scheduled submission date, and the Commission will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the candidate is entitled on the next regularly scheduled certification date. Each corrected submission shall only contain contributions previously submitted for matching in the returned submission and no new or additional contributions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptance of submission for review of matchability.</E> If the Commission determines that a submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 satisfies the requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2 (b), (c) and (d), and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order, it will review the matchability of the contributions contained therein. The Commission, in conducting its review, may utilize statistical sampling techniques. Based on the results of its review, the Commission may calculate a matchable amount for the submission which is less than the amount requested by the candidate. If the Commission certifies for payment to the Secretary an amount that is less than the amount requested by the candidate in a particular submission, or reduces the amount of a subsequent certification to the Secretary by adjusting a previous certification made under 11 CFR 9036.2(c)(1), the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount of the difference between the amount requested and the amount to be certified by the Commission;</P>
            <P>(2) The amount of each contribution and the corresponding contributor's name for each contribution that the Commission has rejected as nonmatchable and the reason that it is not matchable; or if statistical sampling is used, the estimated amount of contributions by type and the reason for rejection;</P>

            <P>(3) The amount of contributions that have been determined to be matchable <PRTPAGE P="351"/>and that the Commission will certify to the Secretary for payment; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement that the candidate may supply the Commission with additional documentation or other information in the resubmission of any rejected contribution under 11 CFR 9036.5 in order to show that a rejected contribution is matchable under 11 CFR 9034.2.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustment of amount to be certified by Commission.</E> (1) The candidate shall notify the Commission as soon as possible if the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) has knowledge that a contribution submitted for matching does not qualify under 11 CFR 9034.2 as a matchable contribution, such as a check returned to the committee for insufficient funds or a contribution that has been refunded, so that the Commission may properly adjust the amount to be certified for payment.</P>
            <P>(2) After the candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, prior to each subsequent payment date on which the candidate receives payments from any previous certification, the Commission may revise the amount previously certified for payment pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.5(f). The Commission will promptly notify the Secretary and the candidate of any revision to the amount certified.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Commission audit of submissions.</E> The Commission may determine, for the reasons stated in 11 CFR part 9039, that an audit and examination of contributions submitted for matching payment is warranted. The audit and examination shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of 11 CFR part 9039.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Resubmissions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternative resubmission methods.</E> Upon receipt of the Commission's notice of the results of the submission review pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.4(b), or of an inquiry pursuant to 11 CFR 9039.3 that results in a downward adjustment to the amount of certified matching funds, a candidate may choose to:</P>
            <P>(1) Resubmit the entire submission; or</P>
            <P>(2) Make a written request for the identification of the specific contributions that were rejected for matching, and resubmit those specific contributions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time for presentation of resubmissions.</E> If the candidate chooses to resubmit any contributions under 11 CFR 9036.5(a), the contributions shall be resubmitted on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. The candidate may not make any resubmissions later than the first Tuesday in September of the year following the Presidential election year.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Format for resubmissions.</E> All resubmissions filed by the candidate shall be made in accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. In making a presentation of resubmitted contributions, the candidate shall follow the format requirements as specified in 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), except that:</P>
            <P>(1) The candidate need not provide photocopies of written instruments, supporting documentation and bank documentation unless it is necessary to supplement the original documentation.</P>
            <P>(2) Each resubmitted contribution shall be referenced to the submission in which it was first presented.</P>
            <P>(3) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each contributor as of the date of the original submission.</P>
            <P>(4) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each contributor as of the date of the resubmission.</P>
            <P>(5) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall only contain contributions previously submitted for matching and no new or additional contributions.</P>
            <P>(6) Each resubmission shall be accompanied by a statement that the candidate has corrected his or her contributor records (including the data base for those candidates maintaining their contributor list on computer).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of resubmitted contributions.</E> Contributions that the Commission determines to be matchable will be certified to the Secretary at <PRTPAGE P="352"/>least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. If the candidate chooses to request the specific contributions rejected for matching pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.5(a)(2), the amount certified shall equal only the matchable amount of the particular contribution that meets the standards on resubmission, rather than the amount projected as being nonmatchable based on that contribution due to the sampling techniques used in reviewing the original submission.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Initial determinations.</E> If the candidate resubmits a contribution for matching and the Commission determines that the rejected contribution is still non-matchable, the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of its determination. The Commission will advise the candidate of the legal and factual reasons for its determination and of the evidence on which that determination is based. The candidate may submit written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the contribution is matchable within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Final determinations.</E> The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate in making its final determination. A final determination by the Commission that a contribution is not matchable will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation upon which the determination is based.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Audit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The Commission will conduct an audit of the qualified campaign expenses of every candidate and his or her authorized committee(s) who received Presidential primary matching funds. The audit may be conducted at any time after the date of the candidate's ineligibility.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition, the Commission may conduct other examinations and audits from time to time as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(3) Information obtained pursuant to any audit and examination conducted under 11 CFR 9038.1(a) (1) and (2) may be used by the Commission as the basis, or partial basis, for its repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Conduct of fieldwork.</E> (1) If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee does not maintain or use any computerized information containing the data listed in 11 CFR 9033.12, the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data listed in 11 CFR 9033.12, the Commission generally will request such information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such request. Upon receipt of the computerized information requested and compliance with the technical specifications of 11 CFR 9033.12(b), the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request additional or updated computerized information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously provided, and which may be used for purposes including, but not limited to, updating a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations, or updating the amount chargeable to a state expenditure limit. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional computerized information which was created by or becomes available to the committee and that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized information no later than 15 <PRTPAGE P="354"/>calendar days after service of the Commission's request.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Office space and records.</E> On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall provide Commission staff with office space and committee records in accordance with the candidate and committee agreement under 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(6).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Availability of committee personnel.</E> On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall have committee personnel present at the site of the fieldwork. Such personnel shall be familiar with the committee's records and operation and shall be available to Commission staff to answer questions and to aid in locating records.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Failure to provide staff, records or office space.</E> If the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) fail to provide adequate office space, personnel or committee records, the Commission may seek judicial intervention under 52 U.S.C. 30107 or 26 U.S.C. 9040(c) to enforce the candidate and committee agreement made under 11 CFR 9033.1(b). Before seeking judicial intervention, the Commission will notify the candidate of his or her failure to comply with the agreement and will recommend corrective action to bring the candidate into compliance. Upon receipt of the Commission's notification, the candidate will have 10 calendar days in which to take the corrective action indicated or to otherwise demonstrate to the Commission in writing that he or she is complying with the candidate and committee agreement.</P>
            <P>(iv) If, in the course of the audit process, a dispute arises over the documentation sought or other requirements of the candidate agreement, the candidate may seek review by the Commission of the issues raised. To seek review, the candidate shall submit a written statement, within 10 calendar days after the disputed Commission staff request is made, describing the dispute and indicating the candidate's proposed alternative(s).</P>
            <P>(v) If the candidate or his or her authorized committee fails to produce particular records, materials, evidence or other information requested by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(1) or a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(3). The procedures set forth in 11 CFR 111.11 through 111.15, as appropriate, shall apply to the production of such records, materials, evidence or other information as specified in the order, subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.</P>
            <P>(2) Fieldwork will include the following steps designed to keep the candidate and committee informed as to the progress of the audit and to expedite the process:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Entrance conference.</E> At the outset of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an entrance conference, at which the candidate's representatives will be advised of the purpose of the audit and the general procedures to be followed. Future requirements of the candidate and his or her authorized committee, such as possible repayments to the United States Treasury, will also be discussed. Committee representatives shall provide information and records necessary to conduct the audit, and Commission staff will be available to answer committee questions.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> During the fieldwork, Commission staff will review committee records and may conduct interviews of committee personnel. Commission staff will be available to explain aspects of the audit and examination as it progresses. Additional meetings between Commission staff and committee personnel may be held from time to time during the fieldwork to discuss possible audit findings and to resolve issues arising during the course of the audit.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exit conference.</E> At the conclusion of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an exit conference to discuss with committee representatives the staff's preliminary findings and recommendations that the staff anticipates it will present to the Commission for approval. Commission staff will advise committee representatives at this conference of the committee's opportunity to respond to these preliminary findings; the projected timetables regarding the issuance of the Preliminary Audit Report, the Audit Report, and <PRTPAGE P="355"/>any repayment determination; the committee's opportunity for an administrative review of any repayment determination; and the procedures involved in Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2.</P>
            <P>(3) Commission staff may conduct additional fieldwork after the completion of the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(b) (1) and (2). Factors that may necessitate such follow-up fieldwork include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Committee responses to audit findings;</P>
            <P>(ii) Financial activity of the committee subsequent to the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(b)(1);</P>
            <P>(iii) Committee responses to Commission repayment determinations made under 11 CFR 9038.2.</P>
            <P>(4) The Commission will notify the candidate and his or her authorized committee if follow-up fieldwork is necessary. The provisions of 11 CFR 9038.1(b) (1) and (2) shall apply to any additional fieldwork conducted.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Preliminary Audit Report: Issuance by Commission and committee response.</E> (1) Commission staff will prepare a written Preliminary Audit Report, which will be provided to the committee after it is approved by an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the Commission. The Preliminary Audit Report may include—</P>
            <P>(i) An evaluation of procedures and systems employed by the candidate and committee to comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and Commission regulations;</P>
            <P>(ii) The accuracy of statements and reports filed with the Commission by the candidate and committee; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Preliminary calculations regarding future repayments to the United States Treasury.</P>
            <P>(2) The candidate and his or her authorized committee may submit in writing within 60 calendar days after receipt of the Preliminary Audit Report, legal and factual materials disputing or commenting on the proposed findings contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, the committee shall submit any additional documentation requested by the Commission. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval and issuance of audit report.</E> (1) Before voting on whether to issue and approve an audit report, the Commission will consider any written legal and factual materials timely submitted by the candidate or his or her authorized committee in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The Commission-approved audit report may address issues other than those contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, this report will contain a repayment determination made by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.2(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) The audit report may contain issues that warrant referral to the Office of General Counsel for possible enforcement proceedings under 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111.</P>
            <P>(3) Addenda to the audit report may be approved and issued by the Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant and as additional information becomes available. Such addenda may be based on follow-up fieldwork conducted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) (1) and (2) of this section will be followed in preparing such addenda. The addenda will be placed on the public record as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Such addenda may also include additional repayment determination(s).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Public release of audit report.</E> (1) The Commission will consider the audit report in an open session agenda document. The Commission will provide the candidate and the committee with copies of any agenda document to be considered in an open session 24 hours prior to releasing the agenda document to the public.</P>

            <P>(2) Following Commission approval of the audit report, the report will be forwarded to the committee and released to the public.

            <P>(f)(1) <E T="03">Sampling.</E> In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted statistical sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole or in part, of any audit finding.</P>
            <P>(2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding concerning excessive or prohibited contributions shall respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any apparent errors found among the sample items were not errors, the Commission shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.</P>
            <P>(3) Within 30 days of service of the Final Audit Report, the committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3); or take any other action required by the Commission with respect to sample-based findings.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Repayments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A candidate who has received payments from the matching payment account shall pay the United States Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable under this section. In making repayment determinations under this section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1 and part 9039 or otherwise obtained by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission will notify the candidate of any repayment determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not later than 3 years after the close of the matching payment period. The Commission's issuance of the audit report to the candidate under 11 CFR 9038.1(d) will constitute notification for purposes of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Once the candidate receives notice of the Commission's repayment determination under this section, the candidate should give preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of his or her committee, except for any federal taxes owned by the committee.</P>
            <P>(4) Repayments may be made only from the following sources: personal funds of the candidate (without regard to the limitations of 11 CFR 9035.2), contributions and federal funds in the committee's account(s), and any additional funds raised subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Bases for repayment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Payments in excess of candidate's entitlement.</E> The Commission may determine that certain portions of the payments made to a candidate from the matching payment account were in excess of the aggregate amount of payments to which such candidate was entitled. Examples of such excessive payments include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Payments made to the candidate after the candidate's date of ineligibility where it is later determined that the candidate had no net outstanding campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5;</P>
            <P>(ii) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate which are later determined to have been excessive due to the operation of the Commission's expedited payment procedures as set forth in the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order;</P>
            <P>(iii) Payments or portions of payments made on the basis of matched contributions later determined to have been non-matchable;</P>

            <P>(iv) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate which are later determined to have been excessive due to the candidate's failure to include funds received by a fundraising representative committee under 11 <PRTPAGE P="357"/>CFR 9034.8 on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.5; and</P>
            <P>(v) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate on the basis of the debts reflected in the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations, which debts are later settled for an amount less than that stated in the statement of net outstanding campaign obligations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses.</E> (i) The Commission may determine that amount(s) of any payments made to a candidate from the matching payment account were used for purposes other than those set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A)-(C) of this section:</P>
            <P>(A) Defrayal of qualified campaign expenses;</P>
            <P>(B) Repayment of loans which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses; and</P>
            <P>(C) Restoration of funds (other than contributions which were received and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses) which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.</P>
            <P>(ii) Examples of Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2) include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Determinations that a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee(s) or agents have made expenditures in excess of the limitations set forth in 11 CFR part 9035;</P>
            <P>(B) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) were expended in violation of State or Federal law;</P>
            <P>(C) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) were expended for expenses resulting from a violation of State or Federal law, such as the payment of fines or penalties; and</P>
            <P>(D) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) were expended for costs associated with continuing to campaign after the candidate's date of ineligibility.</P>
            <P>(iii) The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount determined to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as of 90 days after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)—</P>
            <P>(A) Total deposits is defined in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.3(c)(2); and</P>
            <P>(B) In seeking repayment for non-qualified campaign expenses from committees that have received matching fund payments after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review committee expenditures to determine at what point committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. In doing this, the Commission will review committee expenditures from the date of the last matching fund payment to which the candidate was entitled, using the assumption that the last payment has been expended on a last-in, first-out basis.</P>
            <P>(iv) Repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2) will include all non-qualified campaign expenses paid before the point when committee accounts no longer contain matching funds, including non-qualified campaign expenses listed on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations that may result in a separate repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(1).</P>
            <P>(v) If a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee(s) exceeds both the overall expenditure limitation and one or more State expenditure limitations, as set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1(a), the repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(ii)(A) shall be based on only the larger of either the amount exceeding the State expenditure limitation(s) or the amount exceeding the overall expenditure limitation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to provide adequate documentation.</E> The Commission may determine that amount(s) spent by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee(s), or agents were not documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11. The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall be determined by using the formula set forth in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(iii).</P>

            <P>(4) The Commission may determine that the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, as defined in 11 <PRTPAGE P="358"/>CFR 9034.5, reflect a surplus. The Commission may determine that the net income derived from an investment or other use of surplus public funds after the candidate's date of ineligibility, less Federal, State and local taxes paid on such income, shall be paid to the Treasury.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Repayment determination procedures.</E> The Commission's repayment determination will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Repayment determination.</E> The Commission will provide the candidate with a written notice of its repayment determination(s). This notice will be included in the Commission's audit report prepared pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(d), or inquiry report pursuant to 11 CFR 9039.3, and will set forth the legal and factual reasons for such determination(s), as well as the evidence upon which any such determination is based. The candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the amount which the Commission has determined to be repayable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Administrative review of repayment determination.</E> If a candidate disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s), he or she may request an administrative review of the determination(s) as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Submission of written materials.</E> A candidate who disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s) shall submit in writing, within 60 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, legal and factual materials demonstrating that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires. The candidate's failure to timely raise an issue in written materials presented pursuant to this paragraph will be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to raise the issue at any future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9041(a).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> A candidate who submits written materials pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may at the same time request in writing that the Commission provide such candidate with an opportunity to address the Commission in open session to demonstrate that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. The candidate should identify in this request the repayment issues he or she wants to address at the oral hearing. If the Commission decides by an affirmative vote of four (4) of its members to grant the candidate's request, it will inform the candidate of the date and time set for the oral hearing. At the date and time set by the Commission, the candidate or candidate's designated representative will be allotted an amount of time in which to make an oral presentation to the Commission based upon the legal and factual materials submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The candidate or representative will also have the opportunity to answer any questions from individual members of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Repayment determination upon review.</E> In deciding whether to revise any repayment determination(s) following an administrative review pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commission will consider any submission made under paragraph (c)(2)(i) and any oral hearing conducted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii), and may also consider any new or additional information from other sources. A determination following an administrative review that a candidate must repay a certain amount will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons supporting the Commission's determination(s). This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination(s) and will summarize the results of any investigation(s) upon which the determination(s) are based.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Repayment period.</E> (1) Within 90 calendar days of service of the notice of the Commission's repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.<PRTPAGE P="359"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) If the candidate requests an administrative review of the Commission's repayment determination(s) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission has concluded its administrative review of the repayment determination(s). Within 30 calendar days after service of the notice of the Commission's post-administrative review repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.</P>
            <P>(3) Interest shall be assessed on all repayments made after the initial 90-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the 30-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The amount of interest due shall be the greater of:</P>
            <P>(i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Computation of time.</E> The time periods established by this section shall be computed in accordance with 11 CFR 111.2.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional repayments.</E> Nothing in this section will prevent the Commission from making additional repayment determinations on one or more of the bases set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2(b) after it has made a repayment determination on any such basis. The Commission may make additional repayment determinations where there exist facts not used as the basis for any previous determination. Any such additional repayment determination will be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Newly-discovered assets.</E> If, after any repayment determination made under this section, a candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) receives or becomes aware of assets not previously included in any statement of net outstanding campaign obligations submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.5, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall promptly notify the Commission of such newly-discovered assets. Newly-discovered assets may include refunds, rebates, late-arriving receivables, and actual receipts for capital assets in excess of the value specified in any previously-submitted statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. Newly-discovered assets may serve as a basis for additional repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(f).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing; stays pending appeal.</E> The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a). The candidate may request a stay of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(c) pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination.</P>

            <P>(a) The candidate may retain amounts received from the matching payment account for a period not exceeding 6 months after the matching payment period to pay qualified campaign expenses incurred by the candidate.</P>
            <P>(b) After all obligations have been liquidated, the candidate shall so inform the Commission in writing.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) If on the last day of candidate eligibility the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5, reflect a surplus, the candidate shall within 30 calendar days of the ineligibility date repay to the Secretary an amount which represents the amount of matching funds contained in the candidate's surplus. The amount shall be an amount equal to that portion of the surplus which bears the same ratio to the total surplus that the total amount received by the candidate from the matching payment account bears to the total deposits made to the candidate's accounts.</P>

            <P>(2) For purposes of this subsection, total deposits means all deposits to all <PRTPAGE P="360"/>candidate accounts minus transfers between accounts, refunds, rebates, reimbursements, checks returned for insufficient funds, proceeds of loans and other similar amounts.</P>
            <P>(3) Notwithstanding the payment of any amounts to the United States Treasury under this section, the Commission may make surplus repayment determination(s) which require repayment in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.2.</P>

            <P>(a) It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time under 11 CFR part 9038 shall not be routinely granted.</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever a candidate has a right or is required to take action within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part 9038 or by notice given thereunder, the candidate may apply in writing to the Commission for an extension of time in which to exercise such right or take such action. The candidate shall demonstrate in the application for extension that good cause exists for his or her request.</P>
            <P>(c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 calendar days prior to the expiration of the time period for which the extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an extension of time to a candidate who has applied for such extension in a timely manner. The length of time of any extension granted hereunder will be decided by the Commission and may be less than the amount of time sought by the candidate in his or her application. If a candidate seeks an extension of any 60-day response period under 11 CFR part 9038, the Commission may grant no more than one extension to that candidate, which extension shall not exceed 15 days.</P>
            <P>(d) If a candidate fails to seek an extension of time, exercise a right or take a required action prior to the expiration of a time period prescribed by 11 CFR part 9038 the Commission may, on the candidate's showing of excusable neglect:</P>
            <P>(1) Permit such candidate to exercise his or her right(s), or take such required action(s) after the expiration of the prescribed time period; and</P>
            <P>(2) Take into consideration any information obtained in connection with the exercise of any such right or taking of any such action before making decisions or determinations under 11 CFR part 9038.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Petitions for rehearing.</E> (1) Following the Commission's final determination under 11 CFR 9033.10 or 9034.5(g) or the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(c), the candidate may file a petition for rehearing setting forth the relief desired and the legal and factual basis in support. To be considered by the Commission, petitions for rehearing must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be filed within 20 calendar days after service of the Commission's final determination or repayment determination;</P>
            <P>(ii) Raise new questions of law or fact that would materially alter the Commission's final determination or repayment determination; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Set forth clear and convincing grounds why such questions were not and could not have been presented during the original determination process.</P>
            <P>(2) If a candidate files a timely petition under this section challenging a Commission repayment determination, the time for repayment of the amount at issue will be suspended until the Commission serves notice on the candidate of its determination on the petition. The time periods for making repayment under 11 CFR 9038.2(d) shall apply to any amounts determined to be repayable following the Commission's consideration of a petition for rehearing under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of failure to raise issues.</E> The candidate's failure to raise an argument in a timely fashion during the original determination process or in a petition for rehearing under this section, as appropriate, shall be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to present such arguments in any future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9041(a). An issue is not timely raised in a petition for rehearing if it could have <PRTPAGE P="361"/>been raised earlier in response to the Commission's original determination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Stay of repayment determination pending appeal.</E> (1)(i) The candidate may apply to the Commission for a stay of all or a portion of the amount determined to be repayable under this section or under 11 CFR 9038.2 pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9041(a). The repayment amount requested to be stayed shall not exceed the amount at issue on appeal.</P>
            <P>(ii) A request for a stay shall be made in writing and shall be filed within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's decision on a petition for rehearing under paragraph (a) of this section, or, if no petition for rehearing is filed, within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(c).</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission's approval of a stay request will be conditioned upon the candidate's presentation of evidence in the stay request that he or she:</P>
            <P>(i) Has placed the entire amount at issue in a separate interest-bearing account pending the outcome of the appeal and that withdrawals from the account may only be made with the joint signatures of the candidate or his or her agent and a Commission representative; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Has posted a surety bond guaranteeing payment of the entire amount at issue plus interest; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Has met the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(A) He or she will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a stay; and, if so, that</P>
            <P>(B) He or she has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success on the merits of the judicial action.</P>
            <P>(C) Such relief is consistent with the public interest; and</P>
            <P>(D) No other party interested in the proceedings would be substantially harmed by the stay.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining whether the candidate has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success on the merits under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the Commission may consider whether the issue on appeal presents a novel or admittedly difficult legal question and whether the equities of the case suggest that the status quo should be maintained.</P>
            <P>(4) All stays shall require the payment of interest on the amount at issue. The amount of interest due shall be calculated from the date 30 days after service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(c) and shall be the greater of:</P>
            <P>(i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Retention of books and records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The candidate and his or her authorized committee(s) shall keep all books, records and other information required under 11 CFR 9033.11, 9034.2 and part 9036 for a period of three years pursuant to 11 CFR 102.9(c) and shall furnish such books, records and information to the Commission on request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Continuing review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In reviewing candidate submissions made under 11 CFR part 9036 and in otherwise carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter, the Commission may routinely consider information from the following sources:</P>
            <P>(1) Any and all materials and communications which the candidate and his or her authorized committee(s) submit or provide under 11 CFR part 9036 and in response to inquiries or requests of the Commission and its staff;</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 9039.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Examination and audits; investigations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The Commission will consider information obtained in its continuing review under 11 CFR 9039.2 in making any certification, determination or finding under this subchapter. If the Commission decides by an affirmative vote of four of its members that additional information must be obtained in connection with any such certification, determination or finding, it will conduct a further inquiry. A decision to conduct an inquiry under this section may be based on information that is obtained under 11 CFR 9039.2, received by the Commission from outside sources, or otherwise ascertained by the Commission in carrying out its supervisory responsibilities under the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act and the Federal Election Campaign Act.</P>

            <P>(2) An inquiry conducted under this section may be used to obtain information relevant to candidate eligibility, matchability of contributions and repayments to the United States Treasury. Information obtained during such an inquiry may be used as the basis, or partial basis, for Commission certifications, determinations and findings under 11 CFR parts 9033, 9034, 9036 and 9038. Information thus obtained may also be the basis of, or be considered in connection with, an investigation under 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111.<PRTPAGE P="363"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Before conducting an inquiry under this section, the Commission will attempt to obtain relevant information under the continuing review provisions of 11 CFR 9039.2. Matching payments will not be withheld pending the results of an inquiry under this section unless the Commission finds patent irregularities suggesting the possibility of fraud in materials submitted by, or in the activities of, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (1) The Commission will notify the candidate of its decision to conduct an inquiry under this section. The notice will summarize the legal and factual basis for the Commission's decision.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission's inquiry may include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A field audit of the candidate's books and records;</P>
            <P>(ii) Field interviews of agents and representatives of the candidate and his or her authorized committee(s);</P>
            <P>(iii) Verification of reported contributions by contacting reported contributors;</P>
            <P>(iv) Verification of disbursement information by contacting reported vendors;</P>
            <P>(v) Written questions under order;</P>
            <P>(vi) Production of documents under subpoena;</P>
            <P>(vii) Depositions.</P>
            <P>(3) The provisions of 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111 will not apply to inquiries conducted under this section except that the provisions of 11 CFR 111.12 through 111.15 shall apply to any orders or subpoenas issued by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(4) If, at the close of the inquiry, the Commission determines that no action or no further action is warranted, the Commission shall so notify the candidate. If the inquiry results in an adjustment to the amount of certified matching funds, the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9036.5 or 9038.1 shall be followed, as appropriate. If the inquiry coincides with an audit undertaken pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1, the information obtained in the inquiry will be utilized in making the repayment determination. If the inquiry results in an initial or additional repayment determination, the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2, 9038.4, and 9038.5 shall be followed.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 9405.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in this part, the term—</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Chief FOIA Officer</E> means the person designated under § 9405.3(d) who has Commission-wide responsibility for the efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a FOIA request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his/her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The FOIA Officer will determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested documents. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use for which the requester claims to have made the FOIA request or where that use is not clear from the FOIA request itself, the FOIA Officer will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Commission</E> means the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. 15301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
          </P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Commissioner</E> means an individual appointed to the Commission by the President and confirmed by the Senate under section 203 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. 15323.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the Commission actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, in the case of commercial use requesters, reviewing documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, but are not limited to, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that basic rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the cost of space and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Examples of the form such copies can take include, but are not limited to, paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape, DVD, or CD). The Commission will honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the records requested are reasonably reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Executive Director</E> means the Executive Director of the Commission or his or her designee.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">FOIA</E> means Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">FOIA Officer</E> means a person designated by the Chief FOIA Officer under § 9405.3(d) to carry out day-to-day <PRTPAGE P="368"/>implementation of the FOIA activities of the Commission.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison</E> means a person designated by the Chief FOIA Officer under § 9405.3(d) to assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the Commission.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">FOIA request</E> means to seek the release of records under 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">General Counsel</E> means the General Counsel of the Commission or his or her designee.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an organization that is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Record</E> means any information that would be a Commission record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the Commission in any format, including, but not limited to, an electronic format. Record includes information that is maintained for the Commission by an entity under Government contract for the purposes of records management.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. As used in this paragraph, “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, web logs, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances in which these entities can qualify as disseminators of news, as defined in this paragraph) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. As used in this paragraph, a “web log” means a publicly available Web site, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a news media entity and therefore, considered a representative of the news media if that person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news organization (whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity). A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation. The Commission may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making this determination.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Requester</E> is any person who submits a FOIA request to the Commission for release of a record under 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining a document located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of the document located is exempt from disclosure. Review also refers to processing any document for disclosure, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, doing all that is necessary to excise exempt portions of the document or otherwise prepare the document for release. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter requesting confidential treatment but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Search</E> means all time spent reviewing, manually or by automated means, Commission records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to a FOIA request, including, but not limited to, page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. Search time does not include review of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 9405.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Policy on disclosure of records.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The Commission will make the fullest possible disclosure of records to the public, consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy, the rights of individuals and other entities with respect to trade secrets and commercial or financial information entitled to privileged and confidential treatment, and the need for the Commission to <PRTPAGE P="369"/>promote free internal policy deliberations and to pursue its official activities without undue disruption.</P>
          <P>(b) All Commission records shall be available to the public unless they are specifically exempt under this part.</P>
          <P>(c) In the interest of efficiency and economy, the Commission's preference is to furnish records to requesters in electronic format, when possible.</P>
          <P>(d) To carry out this policy, the Commission shall designate a Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer (Chief FOIA Officer). The Chief FOIA Officer shall designate one or more Commission officials, as appropriate, as FOIA Public Liaison and/or as FOIA Officers. A FOIA Public Liaison shall serve as a supervisory official to whom a FOIA requester can raise questions about the service the FOIA requester has received. A FOIA Officer shall have the authority, subject to the direction and supervision of the Chief FOIA Officer, the requirements of this part, and the FOIA, to make decisions concerning disclosure of records to the public.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 9405.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Availability of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The FOIA and its provisions apply only to existing Commission records; the FOIA does not require the creation of new records.</P>
          <P>(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the Commission shall make the following materials available for public inspection and copying:</P>

          <P>(1) Statements of policy and interpretation that have been adopted by the Commission but have not been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
          <P>(2) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</P>
          <P>(3) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have been released to any person under this paragraph and that, because of their nature or subject matter, the Commission determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; and</P>
          <P>(4) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), the Commission shall make available, upon proper request, all non-exempt Commission records, or portions of records, not previously made public under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2).</P>

          <P>(d) The Commission shall maintain and make available current indexes and supplements providing identifying information regarding any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967. These indexes and supplements shall be published and made available on at least a quarterly basis for public distribution unless the Commission determines by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that publication would be unnecessary, impracticable, or not feasible due to budgetary considerations. Nevertheless, copies of any index or supplement shall be made available upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.</P>
          <P>(e) If documents or files contain both disclosable and non-disclosable information, the non-disclosable information will be deleted and the disclosable information released, unless the disclosable portions cannot be reasonably segregated from the other portions in a manner which will allow meaningful information to be disclosed.</P>
          <P>(f) All records created in the process of implementing provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 will be maintained by the Commission in accordance with the authority granted by the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration.</P>

          <P>(g) The Commission encourages the public to explore the information available on the Commission's Web site, located at <E T="03">http://www.eac.gov.</E>

          <SUBJECT>Categories of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) No FOIA requests under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be denied release unless the record contains, or its disclosure would reveal, matters that are:</P>
          <P>(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are, in fact, properly classified under such Executive Order;</P>

          <P>(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;<PRTPAGE P="370"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:</P>
          <P>(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or</P>
          <P>(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
          <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that are privileged or confidential. Such information includes confidential business information which concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of works, or apparatus, or to the production, sales, shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers, inventories, or amount of source of income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization, if the disclosure is likely to have the effect of either impairing the Commission's ability to obtain such information as is necessary to perform its statutory functions or causing substantial harm to the competitive position of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization from which the information was obtained, unless the Commission is required by law to disclose such information. For purposes of this section, trade secret means a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. Examples of trade secrets may include, but are not limited to, plans, schematics, specifications of materials used in production, source code used to develop software, technical descriptions of manufacturing process, quality control methodology, and test results. The following procedures shall be used for submitting business information in confidence:</P>
          <P>(i) Clearly mark any portion of any data or information being submitted that in the submitter's opinion is a trade secret or commercial and financial information that the submitter is claiming should be treated as privileged and confidential and submit such data or information separately from other material being submitted to the Commission;</P>
          <P>(ii) A request for confidential treatment shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1335 East-West Highway, Suite 4300, Silver Spring, MD 20910 and shall indicate clearly on the envelope that it is a request for confidential treatment.</P>
          <P>(iii) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the submitter shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public:</P>
          <P>(A) A written description of the nature of the subject information and a justification for the request for its confidential treatment, and</P>
          <P>(B) A certification in writing under oath that substantially identical information is not available to the public.</P>
          <P>(iv) Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designees. A denial shall be in writing, shall specify the reason for the denial, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(v) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee if the appeal is filed within 15 days after receipt of the denial. An appeal shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1335 East-West Highway, Suite 4300, Silver Spring, MD 20910 and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal will be decided within 20 days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) unless an extension, stated in writing with the reasons therefore, has been provided to the person making the appeal.</P>

          <P>(vi) Any business information submitted in confidence and determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event that any business information submitted to the Commission is not entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to withdraw <PRTPAGE P="371"/>the tender unless it is the subject of a request under the FOIA or of judicial discovery proceedings.</P>
          <P>(5) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not be available by law to a party in litigation with the Commission;</P>
          <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
          <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
          <P>(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
          <P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
          <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>
          <P>(b) Any portion of a record that reasonably can be segregated from the balance of the record shall be provided to any individual requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt. The amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption in paragraph (a) of this section under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.</P>
          <P>(c) If a requested record is one of another government agency or deals with subject matter to which a government agency other than the Commission has exclusive or primary responsibility, the request for such a record shall be promptly referred by the Commission to that agency for disposition or guidance as to disposition.</P>
          <P>(d) Nothing in this part authorizes withholding of information or limiting the availability of records to the public, except as specifically provided; nor is this part authority to withhold information from Congress.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Discretionary release of exempt records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Commission may, in its discretion, release requested records despite the applicability of the exemptions in § 9405.5, if it determines that it is in the public interest and that the rights of third parties would not be prejudiced. The Executive Director will have the authority to determine that requested records may be released despite otherwise applicable exemptions.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 9405.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Requests for records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Requests for copies of Commission records under the FOIA shall be made in writing and addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1335 East-West Highway, Suite 4300, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  The request shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates, and subject matter to permit the records to be located. A requester will be promptly advised if the records cannot be located on the basis of the description given and that further identifying information must be provided before the request can be satisfied.</P>

          <P>(b) Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including <PRTPAGE P="372"/>electronic formats) of the response. The Commission shall accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission shall respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission. In the interest of efficiency and economy, the Commission's preference is to furnish records to requesters in electronic format, whenever possible.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission shall determine within 20 working days after receipt of a request, or 20 working days after an appeal is granted, whether to comply with such request, unless in unusual circumstances the time is extended. The 20-day period shall commence on the date on which the request was first received by the appropriate component of the Commission, but in any event, not later than 10 days after the request is first received by the component of the Commission designated to receive requests under this part. The 20-day period shall not be tolled by the Commission except—</P>
          <P>(1) The Commission may make one request of the requester for information and toll the 20-day period while it is awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested from the requester.</P>
          <P>(2) If it is necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment.</P>
          <P>(3) Under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, the Commission's receipt of the requester's response to the Commission's request for information or clarification ends the tolling period.</P>
          <P>(d) In the event the time is extended under paragraph (c) of this section, the requester shall be notified of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made. An extension may be made if it is—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessary to locate records or transfer them from physically separate facilities; or</P>
          <P>(2) Necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a large quantity of separate and distinct records that are the subject of a single request; or</P>
          <P>(3) Necessary for consultation with another agency that has a substantial interest in the determination of the request.</P>
          <P>(e) If the Commission determines that an extension of time is necessary to respond to a request satisfying the unusual circumstances specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission shall so notify the requester and give the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section or arrange with the Commission an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.</P>
          <P>(f) The Commission may aggregate and process as a single request requests by the same requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, if the Commission reasonably believes that the requests actually constitute a single request that would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the requests involve clearly related matters.</P>
          <P>(g) The Commission will process requests under the FOIA based on the order they are received.</P>
          <P>(h) The Commission shall consider requests for the expedited processing of requests in cases where the requester demonstrates a compelling need for such processing.</P>
          <P>(1) The term “compelling need” means, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal government activity.</P>
          <P>(2) Requesters for expedited processing must include in their requests a statement setting forth the basis for the claim that a “compelling need” exists for the requested information, certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.</P>

          <P>(3) The Commission shall determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing and notify the requester of such determination within 10 days of receipt of the request. Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed as set forth in § 9405.8. The Commission shall expeditiously <PRTPAGE P="373"/>determine any such appeal. As soon as practicable, the Commission shall process the documents responsive to a request for which expedited processing is granted.</P>
          <P>(i) Any person denied access to records by the Commission shall be notified immediately of the denial, including the reasons for the decision and notified of his or her right to appeal the adverse determination to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(j) The date of receipt of a request under this part shall be the date on which the Chief FOIA Officer actually receives the request.</P>
          <P>(k) Each request received by the Chief FOIA Officer will be assigned an individualized tracking number. Requesters may call (866) 747-1471 and, using the tracking number, obtain information about the request, including the date on which the Commission originally received the request and an estimated date on which the Commission will complete action on the request.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 9405.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Appeals of denials of requests for records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any person who has been notified under § 9405.7(i) that his/her request for inspection of a record or for a copy of a record has been denied, or who has received no response within 20 working days (or within such extended period as is permitted under § 9405.7(d)) after the request has been received by the Commission, or who has received no response within 20 days after a request for expedited processing has been received by the Commission, may appeal the adverse determination or the failure to respond by requesting the Commission to direct that the record be made available or that the expedited processing shall occur.</P>
          <P>(b) The appeal request shall be in writing, shall clearly and prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page “FOIA Appeal,” and shall identify the record in the form in which it was originally requested.</P>
          <P>(c) The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1225 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20005.</P>
          <P>(d) The requester may state facts and cite legal or other authorities as he or she deems appropriate in support of the appeal request.</P>
          <P>(e) The Commission will make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20 working days after receipt of the appeal (or within such extended period as is permitted under § 9405.7). If, on appeal, the denial of the request for a record or a copy is in whole or in part upheld, the Commission shall advise the requester of the denial and shall notify him or her of the provisions for judicial review of that determination as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).</P>
          <P>(f) Because of the risk of misunderstanding inherent in oral communications, the Commission will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has orally requested a copy of a record that he or she believes to have been improperly denied should resubmit the request in writing as set forth in § 9405.7.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 9405.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees in general.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Commission will charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs. The Commission will use the most efficient and least costly means to comply with requests for documentation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Manual searches for records.</E> The Commission will charge fees at the salary rate(s) (basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Computer searches for records.</E> The Commission will charge the actual direct cost of operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for the initial review (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the review undertaken the first time <PRTPAGE P="374"/>the Commission analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record). Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review are assessable. The Commission will charge at the salary rate(s) (basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) reviewing records.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Duplication of records.</E> Records will be duplicated at a rate of fifteen (15) cents per page. For copies prepared by computers, such as tapes, CDs, DVDs, or printouts, the Commission shall charge the actual cost, including operator time, of production. For other methods of reproduction or duplication, the Commission will charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s). If the Commission estimates that duplication charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> The Commission will recover the full costs of providing services such as those enumerated below when it provides them in response to a direct request for such services:</P>
          <P>(1) Certifying that records are true copies; or</P>
          <P>(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> Remittance shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States or a postal money order. Remittance shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1225 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20005.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Receipt of fees.</E> A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request. Refund of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Restrictions on assessing fees.</E> The Commission shall not assess search fees or duplication fees under this paragraph if the Commission fails to comply with any time limit in these regulations. The Commission will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, the Commission will not charge fees for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time.</P>
          <P>(1) The elements to be considered in determining the “cost of collecting a fee” are the administrative costs of receiving and recording a requester's remittance and processing the fee for deposit in the Treasury Department's special account.</P>
          <P>(2) For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word “pages” means paper copies of 8.5″ × 11″ or 11″ × 14″. Thus, requesters are not entitled to 100 computer disks, for example.</P>

          <P>(3) For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the term “search time” means manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, the Commission will determine the hourly cost of operating the CPU and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of such search (including operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of salary of the person performing the search (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the operator), the Commission will begin assessing charges for computer search.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 9405.10</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.</SUBJECT>
          <P>There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> When the Commission receives a request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the record sought. Commercial use requesters are <PRTPAGE P="375"/>neither entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication. The Commission may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see § 9405.11(b)).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> The Commission shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the record is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in the furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Representatives of the news media.</E> The Commission shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, the requester must fit the definition of a representative of the news media as stated in § 9405.2, and the request must not be made for commercial use. For purposes of this paragraph, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for commercial use.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The Commission shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 9405.11</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Miscellaneous fee provisions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Charging Interest—notice and rate.</E> The Commission may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The fact that the fee has been received by the Commission within the 30-day grace period, even if it is not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful search.</E> The Commission may assess charges for time spent searching, even if it fails to locate the records or if the records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If the Commission estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requestors acting in concert has submitted requests that constitute a single request involving clearly related matters, the Commission may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period over which the requests have occurred.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> The Commission may not require a requester to make an advance payment (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, payment before work is commenced or continued on a request) unless:</P>
          <P>(1) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, the Commission will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>

          <P>(2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, within 30 days of the date of the <PRTPAGE P="376"/>billing). Then, the Commission may require the requester to:</P>
          <P>(i) Pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and</P>
          <P>(ii) Make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>
          <P>(3) When the Commission acts under paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will begin only after the Commission has received payments described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of Debt Collection Act of 1982.</E> The Commission shall comply with the provisions of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 9405.12</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Waiver or reduction of charges.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge when the Chief FOIA Officer determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear. The fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance in the legal proceeding.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> Witness fees shall be paid for current Commission employees and any records certification fees by submitting to the General Counsel a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony by former Commission employees, applicable fees shall be paid directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification (authentication) of copies of records.</E> The Commission may certify that records are true copies to <PRTPAGE P="386"/>facilitate their use as evidence. To obtain certification a request for certified copies shall be made to the Commission at least 45 days before the date the copies will be needed. The request should be sent to the General Counsel, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1335 East-West Highway, Suite 4300, Silver Spring, MD 20910.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The Commission shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes will be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Commission will develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes.

          <P>(1) The commission will furnish appropriate auxiliary aids when necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Commission.</P>
