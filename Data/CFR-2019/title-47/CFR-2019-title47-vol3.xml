      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) A nondominant interexchange carrier (IXC) shall make available to any member of the public, in at least one location, during regular business hours, information concerning its current rates, terms and conditions for all of its international and interstate, domestic, interexchange services. Such information shall be made available in an easy to understand format and in a <PRTPAGE P="6"/>timely manner. Following an inquiry or complaint from the public concerning rates, terms and conditions for such services, a carrier shall specify that such information is available and the manner in which the public may obtain the information.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition, a nondominant IXC that maintains an Internet website shall make such rate and service information specified in paragraph (a) of this section available on-line at its Internet website in a timely and easily accessible manner, and shall update this information regularly.</P>

              <P>(a) A nondominant IXC shall maintain, for submission to the Commission and to state regulatory commissions upon request, price and service information regarding all of the carrier's international and interstate, domestic, interexchange service offerings. A commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) provider shall maintain such price and service information only about its international common carrier service offerings and only for those routes on which the CMRS provider is classified as dominant under § 63.10 of this Chapter due to an affiliation with a foreign carrier that collects settlement payments from U.S. carriers for terminating U.S. international switched traffic at the foreign end of the route. Such a CMRS provider is not required to maintain its price and service information, however, on any such affiliated route if it provides service on that route solely through the resale of an unaffiliated facilities-based provider's international switched services. The price and service information maintained for purposes of this paragraph shall include documents supporting the rates, terms, and conditions of the carrier's international and interstate, domestic, interexchange offerings. The information maintained pursuant to this section shall be maintained in a manner that allows the carrier to produce such records within ten business days. For purposes of this paragraph, <E T="03">affiliated</E> and <E T="03">foreign carrier</E> are defined in § 63.09 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) The price and service information maintained pursuant to this section shall be retained for a period of at least two years and six months following the date the carrier ceases to provide services pursuant to such rates, terms and conditions.</P>

            <P>(a) Each communication common carrier with annual operating expenses that equal or exceed the indexed revenue threshold, as defined in § 32.9000, and that has been found by this Commission to be a dominant carrier with respect to any communications service shall, before making any changes in the depreciation rates applicable to its operated plant, file with the Commission a report furnishing the data described in the subsequent paragraphs of this section, and also comply with the other requirements thereof.</P>
            <P>(b) Each such report shall contain the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A schedule showing for each class and subclass of plant (whether or not the depreciation rate is proposed to be changed) an appropriate designation therefor, the depreciation rate currently in effect, the proposed rate, and the service-life and net-salvage estimates underlying both the current and proposed depreciation rates;</P>
            <P>(2) An additional schedule showing for each class and subclass, as well as the totals for all depreciable plant, (i) the book cost of plant at the most recent date available, (ii) the estimated amount of depreciation accruals determined by applying the currently effective rate to the amount of such book cost, (iii) the estimated amount of depreciation accruals determined by applying the rate proposed to be used to the amount of such book cost, and (iv) the difference between the amounts determined in paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) A statement giving the reasons for the proposed change in each rate;</P>
            <P>(4) A statement describing the method or methods employed in the development of the service-life and salvage estimates underlying each proposed change in a depreciation rate; and</P>
            <P>(5) The date as of which the revised rates are proposed to be made effective in the accounts.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this section, when the change in the depreciation rate proposed for any class or subclass of plant (other than one occasioned solely by a shift in the relative investment in the several subclasses of the class of plant) amounts to twenty percent (20%) or more of the rate currently applied thereto, or when the proposed change will produce an increase or decrease of one percent (1%) or more of the aggregate depreciation charges for all depreciable plant (based on the amounts determined in compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section) the carrier shall supplement the data required by paragraph (b) of this section) with copies of the underlying studies, including calculations and charts, developed by the carrier to support service-life and net-salvage estimates. If a carrier must submit data of a repetitive nature to comply with this requirement, the carrier need only submit a fully illustrative portion thereof.</P>
            <P>(1) A Local Exchange Carrier regulated under price caps, pursuant to §§ 61.41 through 61.49 of this chapter, is not required to submit the supplemental information described in paragraph (c) introductory text of this section for a specific account if: The carrier's currently prescribed depreciation rate for the specific accounts derived from basic factors that fall within the basic factor ranges established for that same account; and the carrier's proposed depreciation rate for the specific account would also be derived from basic factors that fall within the basic factor ranges for the same account.</P>

            <P>(2) Local Exchange Carriers that are regulated under price caps, pursuant to §§ 61.41 through 61.49 of this chapter, and have selected basic factors that fall within the basic factor ranges for all accounts are exempt from paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c) introductory text of this section. They shall instead comply with paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(5) of this section and provide a book and theoretical reserve <PRTPAGE P="10"/>summary and a summary of basic factors underlying proposed rates by account.</P>
            <P>(3) Interexchange carriers regulated under price caps, pursuant to §§ 61.41 through 61.49 of this chapter, are exempted from submitting the supplemental information as described in paragraph (c) introductory text of this section. They shall instead submit: Generation data, a summary of basic factors underlying proposed depreciation rates by account and a short narrative supporting those basic factors, including company plans of forecasted retirements and additions, recent annual retirements, salvage and cost of removal.</P>
            <P>(d) Each report shall be filed in duplicate and the original shall be signed by the responsible official to whom correspondence related thereto should be addressed.</P>

            <P>(e) Unless otherwise directed or approved by the Commission, the following shall be observed: Proposed changes in depreciation rates shall be filed at least ninety (90) days prior to the last day of the month with respect to which the revised rates are first to be applied in the accounts (e.g., if the new rates are to be first applied in the depreciation accounts for September, they must be filed on or before July 1). Such rates may be made retroactive to a date not prior to the beginning of the year in which the filing is made: <E T="03">Provided however,</E> that in no event shall a carrier for which the Commission has prescribed depreciation rates make any changes in such rates unless the changes are prescribed by the Commission. Carriers who select basic factors that fall within the basic factor ranges for all accounts are exempt from depreciation rate prescription by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(f) Any changes in depreciation rates that are made under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall not be construed as having been approved by the Commission unless the carrier has been specifically so informed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Competing provider.</E> A “competing provider” is a provider of telephone exchange or telephone toll services that seeks nondiscriminatory access from a local exchange carrier (LEC) in that LEC's service area.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Nondiscriminatory access.</E> “Nondiscriminatory access” refers to access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance and directory listings that is at least equal to the access that the providing local exchange carrier (LEC) itself receives. Nondiscriminatory access includes, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Nondiscrimination between and among carriers in the rates, terms, and conditions of the access provided; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The ability of the competing provider to obtain access that is at least equal in quality to that of the providing LEC.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Providing local exchange carrier</E> (LEC). A “providing local exchange carrier” is a local exchange carrier (LEC) that is required to permit nondiscriminatory access to a competing provider.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A local exchange carrier (LEC) that provides operator services, directory assistance services or directory listings to its customers, or provides telephone numbers, shall permit competing providers of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service to have nondiscriminatory access to that service or feature, with no unreasonable dialing delays.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific requirements.</E> A LEC subject to paragraph (b) of this section must also comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Telephone numbers.</E> A LEC shall permit competing providers to have access to telephone numbers that is identical to the access that the LEC provides to itself.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operator services.</E> A LEC must permit telephone service customers to connect to the operator services offered by that customer's chosen local service provider by dialing “0,” or “0” plus the desired telephone number, regardless of the identity of the customer's local telephone service provider.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Directory assistance services and directory listings</E>—(i) <E T="03">Access to directory assistance.</E> A LEC shall permit competing providers to have access to its directory assistance services, including directory assistance databases, so that any customer of a competing provider can obtain directory listings, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, on a nondiscriminatory basis, notwithstanding the identity of the customer's local service provider, or the identity of the provider for the customer whose listing is requested. A LEC must supply access to directory assistance in the manner specified by the competing provider, including transfer of the LECs' directory assistance databases in readily accessible magnetic tape, electronic or other convenient format, as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Updates to the directory assistance database shall be made in the same format as the initial transfer (unless the requesting LEC requests otherwise), and shall be performed in a timely manner, taking no longer than those made to the providing LEC's own database. A LEC shall accept the listings of those customers served by competing providers for inclusion in its directory assistance/operator services databases.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Access to directory listings.</E> A LEC that compiles directory listings shall share directory listings with competing providers in the manner specified by the competing provider, including readily accessible tape or electronic <PRTPAGE P="20"/>formats, as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Such data shall be provided in a timely fashion.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Format.</E> A LEC shall provide access to its directory assistance services, including directory assistance databases, and to its directory listings in any format the competing provider specifies, if the LEC's internal systems can accommodate that format.</P>
              <P>(A) If a LEC's internal systems do not permit it provide directory assistance or directory listings in the format the specified by the competing provider, the LEC shall:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Within thirty days of receiving the request, inform the competing provider that the requested format cannot be accommodated and tell the requesting provider which formats can be accommodated; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Provide the requested directory assistance or directory listings in the format the competing provider chooses from among the available formats.</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Unlisted numbers.</E> A LEC shall not provide access to unlisted telephone numbers, or other information that its customer has asked the LEC not to make available, with the exception of customer name and address. The LEC shall ensure that access is permitted to the same directory information, including customer name and address, that is available to its own directory assistance customers.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Adjuncts to services.</E> Operator services and directory assistance services must be made available to competing providers in their entirety, including access to any adjunct features (e.g., rating tables or customer information databases) necessary to allow competing providers full use of these services.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Branding of operator services and directory assistance services.</E> The refusal of a providing local exchange carrier (LEC) to comply with the reasonable request of a competing provider that the providing LEC rebrand its operator services and directory assistance, or remove its brand from such services, creates a presumption that the providing LEC is unlawfully restricting access to its operator services and directory assistance. The providing LEC can rebut this presumption by demonstrating that it lacks the capability to comply with the competing provider's request.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disputes</E>—(1) <E T="03">Disputes involving nondiscriminatory access.</E> In disputes involving nondiscriminatory access to operator services, directory assistance services, or directory listings, a providing LEC shall bear the burden of demonstrating with specificity:</P>
              <P>(i) That it is permitting nondiscriminatory access, and</P>
              <P>(ii) That any disparity in access is not caused by factors within its control. “Factors within its control” include, but are not limited to, physical facilities, staffing, the ordering of supplies or equipment, and maintenance.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Disputes involving unreasonable dialing delay.</E> In disputes between providing local exchange carriers (LECs) and competing providers involving unreasonable dialing delay in the provision of access to operator services and directory assistance, the burden of proof is on the providing LEC to demonstrate with specificity that it is processing the calls of the competing provider's customers on terms equal to that of similar calls from the providing LEC's own customers.</P>

              <P>(a) An advanced services loop technology is presumed acceptable for deployment under any one of the following circumstances, where the technology:</P>
              <P>(1) Complies with existing industry standards; or</P>
              <P>(2) Is approved by an industry standards body, the Commission, or any state commission; or</P>
              <P>(3) Has been successfully deployed by any carrier without significantly degrading the performance of other services.</P>
              <P>(b) An incumbent LEC may not deny a carrier's request to deploy a technology that is presumed acceptable for deployment unless the incumbent LEC demonstrates to the relevant state commission that deployment of the particular technology will significantly degrade the performance of other advanced services or traditional voiceband services.</P>
              <P>(c) Where a carrier seeks to establish that deployment of a technology falls within the presumption of acceptability under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the burden is on the requesting carrier to demonstrate to the state commission that its proposed deployment meets the threshold for a presumption of acceptability and will not, in fact, significantly degrade the performance of other advanced services or traditional voice band services. Upon a successful demonstration by the requesting carrier before a particular state commission, the deployed technology shall be presumed acceptable for deployment in other areas.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interconnection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An incumbent LEC shall provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the incumbent LEC's network:</P>
              <P>(1) For the transmission and routing of telephone exchange traffic, exchange access traffic, or both;</P>
              <P>(2) At any technically feasible point within the incumbent LEC's network including, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(i) The line-side of a local switch;</P>
              <P>(ii) The trunk-side of a local switch;</P>

              <P>(vi) The points of access to unbundled network elements as described in § 51.319;</P>
              <P>(3) That is at a level of quality that is equal to that which the incumbent LEC provides itself, a subsidiary, an affiliate, or any other party. At a minimum, this requires an incumbent LEC to design interconnection facilities to meet the same technical criteria and service standards that are used within the incumbent LEC's network. This obligation is not limited to a consideration of service quality as perceived by end users, and includes, but is not limited to, service quality as perceived by the requesting telecommunications carrier; and</P>
              <P>(4) On terms and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of any agreement, the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Act, and the Commission's rules including, but not limited to, offering such terms and conditions equally to all requesting telecommunications carriers, and offering such terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions upon which the incumbent LEC provides such interconnection to itself. This includes, but is not limited to, the time within which the incumbent LEC provides such interconnection.</P>
              <P>(b) A carrier that requests interconnection solely for the purpose of originating or terminating its interexchange traffic on an incumbent LEC's network and not for the purpose of providing to others telephone exchange service, exchange access service, or both, is not entitled to receive interconnection pursuant to section 251(c)(2) of the Act.</P>

              <P>(c) Previous successful interconnection at a particular point in a network, using particular facilities, constitutes substantial evidence that interconnection is technically feasible at that point, or at substantially similar points, in networks employing substantially similar facilities. Adherence to the same interface or protocol standards shall constitute evidence of the <PRTPAGE P="24"/>substantial similarity of network facilities.</P>
              <P>(d) Previous successful interconnection at a particular point in a network at a particular level of quality constitutes substantial evidence that interconnection is technically feasible at that point, or at substantially similar points, at that level of quality.</P>
              <P>(e) An incumbent LEC that denies a request for interconnection at a particular point must prove to the state commission that interconnection at that point is not technically feasible.</P>

              <P>(1) Determine whether access to the proprietary network element is “necessary.” A network element is “necessary” if, taking into consideration the availability of alternative elements outside the incumbent LEC's network, including self-provisioning by a requesting telecommunications carrier or acquiring an alternative from a third-party supplier, lack of access to the network element precludes a requesting telecommunications carrier from providing the services that it seeks to offer.

              <P>(1) The requesting telecommunications carrier has received state certification to provide local voice service in the area being served or, in the absence of a state certification requirement, has complied with registration, tariffing, filing fee, or other regulatory requirements applicable to the provision of local voice service in that area.</P>
              <P>(2) The following criteria are satisfied for each combined circuit, including each DS1 circuit, each DS1 enhanced extended link, and each DS1-equivalent circuit on a DS3 enhanced extended link:</P>
              <P>(i) Each circuit to be provided to each customer will be assigned a local number prior to the provision of service over that circuit;</P>
              <P>(ii) Each DS1-equivalent circuit on a DS3 enhanced extended link must have its own local number assignment, so that each DS3 must have at least 28 local voice numbers assigned to it;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Specific unbundling requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Local loops.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to the local loop on an unbundled basis, in accordance with section 251(c)(3) of the Act and this part and as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section. The local loop network element is defined as a transmission facility between a distribution frame (or its equivalent) in an incumbent LEC central office and the loop demarcation point at an end-user customer premises. This element includes all features, functions, and capabilities of such transmission facility, including the network interface device. It also includes all electronics, optronics, and intermediate devices (including repeaters and load coils) used to establish the transmission path to the end-user customer premises as well as any inside wire owned or controlled by the incumbent LEC that is part of that transmission path.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Copper loops.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to the copper loop on an unbundled basis. A copper loop is a stand-alone local loop comprised entirely of copper wire or cable. Copper loops include two-wire and four-wire analog voice-grade copper loops, digital copper loops (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> DS0s and integrated services digital network lines), as well as two-wire and four-wire copper loops conditioned to transmit the digital signals needed to provide digital subscriber line services, regardless of whether the copper loops are in service or held as spares. The copper loop includes attached electronics using time division multiplexing technology, but does not include packet switching capabilities as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The availability of DS1 and DS3 copper loops is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Line splitting.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier that obtains an unbundled copper loop from the incumbent LEC with the ability to engage in line splitting arrangements with another competitive LEC using a splitter collocated at the central office where the loop terminates into a distribution frame or its equivalent. Line splitting is the process in which one competitive LEC provides narrowband voice service over the low frequency portion of a copper loop and a second competitive LEC provides digital subscriber line service over the high frequency portion of that same loop. The high frequency portion of the loop consists of the frequency range on the copper loop above the range that carries analog circuit-switched voice transmissions. This portion of the loop includes the features, functions, and capabilities of the loop that are used to establish a complete transmission path on the high frequency range between the incumbent LEC's distribution frame (or its equivalent) in its central office and the demarcation point at the end-user customer premises, and includes the high frequency portion of any inside wire owned or controlled by the incumbent LEC.</P>

              <P>(A) An incumbent LEC's obligation, under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, to provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with the ability to engage in line splitting applies regardless of whether the carrier providing voice service provides its own switching or obtains local circuit switching from the incumbent LEC.<PRTPAGE P="29"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) An incumbent LEC must make all necessary network modifications, including providing nondiscriminatory access to operations support systems necessary for pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, maintenance and repair, and billing for loops used in line splitting arrangements.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Line conditioning.</E> The incumbent LEC shall condition a copper loop at the request of the carrier seeking access to a copper loop under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a copper subloop under paragraph (b) of this section to ensure that the copper loop or copper subloop is suitable for providing digital subscriber line services, whether or not the incumbent LEC offers advanced services to the end-user customer on that copper loop or copper subloop. If the incumbent LEC seeks compensation from the requesting telecommunications carrier for line conditioning, the requesting telecommunications carrier has the option of refusing, in whole or in part, to have the line conditioned; and a requesting telecommunications carrier's refusal of some or all aspects of line conditioning will not diminish any right it may have, under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, to access the copper loop or the copper subloop.</P>
              <P>(A) Line conditioning is defined as the removal from a copper loop or copper subloop of any device that could diminish the capability of the loop or subloop to deliver high-speed switched wireline telecommunications capability, including digital subscriber line service. Such devices include, but are not limited to, bridge taps, load coils, low pass filters, and range extenders.</P>
              <P>(B) Incumbent LECs shall recover the costs of line conditioning from the requesting telecommunications carrier in accordance with the Commission's forward-looking pricing principles promulgated pursuant to section 252(d)(1) of the Act and in compliance with rules governing nonrecurring costs in § 51.507(e).</P>
              <P>(C) Insofar as it is technically feasible, the incumbent LEC shall test and report troubles for all the features, functions, and capabilities of conditioned copper lines, and may not restrict its testing to voice transmission only.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Maintenance, repair, and testing.</E> (A) An incumbent LEC shall provide, on a nondiscriminatory basis, physical loop test access points to a requesting telecommunications carrier at the splitter, through a cross-connection to the requesting telecommunications carrier's collocation space, or through a standardized interface, such as an intermediate distribution frame or a test access server, for the purpose of testing, maintaining, and repairing copper loops and copper subloops.</P>
              <P>(B) An incumbent LEC seeking to utilize an alternative physical access methodology may request approval to do so from the state commission, but must show that the proposed alternative method is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and will not disadvantage a requesting telecommunications carrier's ability to perform loop or service testing, maintenance, or repair.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Control of the loop and splitter functionality.</E> In situations where a requesting telecommunications carrier is obtaining access to the high frequency portion of a copper loop through a line splitting arrangement, the incumbent LEC may maintain control over the loop and splitter equipment and functions, and shall provide to the requesting telecommunications carrier loop and splitter functionality that is compatible with any transmission technology that the requesting telecommunications carrier seeks to deploy using the high frequency portion of the loop, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, provided that such transmission technology is presumed to be deployable pursuant to § 51.230.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Hybrid loops.</E> A hybrid loop is a local loop composed of both fiber optic cable, usually in the feeder plant, and copper wire or cable, usually in the distribution plant.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Packet switching facilities, features, functions, and capabilities.</E> An incumbent LEC is not required to provide unbundled access to the packet switched features, functions and capabilities of its hybrid loops. Packet switching capability is the routing or forwarding of packets, frames, cells, or other data units based on address or other routing information contained in the packets, frames, cells or other data <PRTPAGE P="30"/>units, and the functions that are performed by the digital subscriber line access multiplexers, including but not limited to the ability to terminate an end-user customer's copper loop (which includes both a low-band voice channel and a high-band data channel, or solely a data channel); the ability to forward the voice channels, if present, to a circuit switch or multiple circuit switches; the ability to extract data units from the data channels on the loops; and the ability to combine data units from multiple loops onto one or more trunks connecting to a packet switch or packet switches.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Broadband services.</E> When a requesting telecommunications carrier seeks access to a hybrid loop for the provision of broadband services, an incumbent LEC shall provide the requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to the time division multiplexing features, functions, and capabilities of that hybrid loop, including DS1 or DS3 capacity (where impairment has been found to exist), on an unbundled basis to establish a complete transmission path between the incumbent LEC's central office and an end user's customer premises. This access shall include access to all features, functions, and capabilities of the hybrid loop that are not used to transmit packetized information.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Narrowband services.</E> When a requesting telecommunications carrier seeks access to a hybrid loop for the provision of narrowband services, the incumbent LEC may either:</P>

              <P>(A) Provide nondiscriminatory access, on an unbundled basis, to an entire hybrid loop capable of voice-grade service (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, equivalent to DS0 capacity), using time division multiplexing technology; or</P>
              <P>(B) Provide nondiscriminatory access to a spare home-run copper loop serving that customer on an unbundled basis.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Fiber loops</E>—(i) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(A) <E T="03">Fiber-to-the-home loops.</E> A fiber-to-the-home loop is a local loop consisting entirely of fiber optic cable, whether dark or lit, serving an end user's customer premises or, in the case of predominantly residential multiple dwelling units (MDUs), a fiber optic cable, whether dark or lit, that extends to the multiunit premises' minimum point of entry (MPOE).</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Fiber-to-the-curb loops.</E> A fiber-to-the-curb loop is a local loop consisting of fiber optic cable connecting to a copper distribution plant that is not more than 500 feet from the customer's premises or, in the case of predominantly residential MDUs, not more than 500 feet from the MDU's MPOE. The fiber optic cable in a fiber-to-the-curb loop must connect to a copper distribution plant at a serving area interface from which every other copper distribution subloop also is not more than 500 feet from the respective customer's premises.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">New builds.</E> An incumbent LEC is not required to provide nondiscriminatory access to a fiber-to-the-home loop or a fiber-to-the-curb loop on an unbundled basis when the incumbent LEC deploys such a loop to an end user's customer premises that previously has not been served by any loop facility.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Overbuilds.</E> An incumbent LEC is not required to provide nondiscriminatory access to a fiber-to-the-home loop or a fiber-to-the-curb loop on an unbundled basis when the incumbent LEC has deployed such a loop parallel to, or in replacement of, an existing copper loop facility, except that:</P>
              <P>(A) The incumbent LEC must maintain the existing copper loop connected to the particular customer premises after deploying the fiber-to-the-home loop or the fiber-to-the-curb loop and provide nondiscriminatory access to that copper loop on an unbundled basis unless the incumbent LEC retires the copper loops pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) An incumbent LEC that maintains the existing copper loops pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section need not incur any expenses to ensure that the existing copper loop remains capable of transmitting signals prior to receiving a request for access pursuant to that paragraph, in which case the incumbent LEC shall restore the copper loop to serviceable condition upon request.</P>

              <P>(C) An incumbent LEC that retires the copper loop pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section shall provide <PRTPAGE P="31"/>nondiscriminatory access to a 64 kilobits per second transmission path capable of voice grade service over the fiber-to-the-home loop or fiber-to-the-curb loop on an unbundled basis.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Retirement of copper loops or copper subloops.</E> Prior to retiring any copper loop or copper subloop that has been replaced with a fiber-to-the-home loop or a fiber-to-the-curb loop, an incumbent LEC must comply with:</P>
              <P>(A) The network disclosure requirements set forth in section 251(c)(5) of the Act and in § 51.325 through § 51.335; and</P>
              <P>(B) Any applicable state requirements.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">DS1 loops.</E> (i) Subject to the cap described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, an incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to a DS1 loop on an unbundled basis to any building not served by a wire center with at least 60,000 business lines and at least four fiber-based collocators. Once a wire center exceeds both of these thresholds, no future DS1 loop unbundling will be required in that wire center. A DS1 loop is a digital local loop having a total digital signal speed of 1.544 megabytes per second. DS1 loops include, but are not limited to, two-wire and four-wire copper loops capable of providing high-bit rate digital subscriber line services, including T1 services.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cap on unbundled DS1 loop circuits.</E> A requesting telecommunications carrier may obtain a maximum of ten unbundled DS1 loops to any single building in which DS1 loops are available as unbundled loops.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">DS3 loops.</E> (i) Subject to the cap described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, an incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to a DS3 loop on an unbundled basis to any building not served by a wire center with at least 38,000 business lines and at least four fiber-based collocators. Once a wire center exceeds both of these thresholds, no future DS3 loop unbundling will be required in that wire center. A DS3 loop is a digital local loop having a total digital signal speed of 44.736 megabytes per second.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cap on unbundled DS3 loop circuits.</E> A requesting telecommunications carrier may obtain a maximum of a single unbundled DS3 loop to any single building in which DS3 loops are available as unbundled loops.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Dark fiber loops.</E> An incumbent LEC is not required to provide requesting telecommunications carriers with access to a dark fiber loop on an unbundled basis. Dark fiber is fiber within an existing fiber optic cable that has not yet been activated through optronics to render it capable of carrying communications services.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Routine network modifications.</E> (i) An incumbent LEC shall make all routine network modifications to unbundled loop facilities used by requesting telecommunications carriers where the requested loop facility has already been constructed. An incumbent LEC shall perform these routine network modifications to unbundled loop facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without regard to whether the loop facility being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.</P>
              <P>(ii) A routine network modification is an activity that the incumbent LEC regularly undertakes for its own customers. Routine network modifications include, but are not limited to, rearranging or splicing of cable; adding an equipment case; adding a doubler or repeater; adding a smart jack; installing a repeater shelf; adding a line card; deploying a new multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer; and attaching electronic and other equipment that the incumbent LEC ordinarily attaches to a DS1 loop to activate such loop for its own customer. Routine network modifications may entail activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable, and installing equipment casings. Routine network modifications do not include the construction of a new loop, or the installation of new aerial or buried cable for a requesting telecommunications carrier.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Engineering policies, practices, and procedures.</E> An incumbent LEC shall <PRTPAGE P="32"/>not engineer the transmission capabilities of its network in a manner, or engage in any policy, practice, or procedure, that disrupts or degrades access to a local loop or subloop, including the time division multiplexing-based features, functions, and capabilities of a hybrid loop, for which a requesting telecommunications carrier may obtain or has obtained access pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Subloops.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to subloops on an unbundled basis in accordance with section 251(c)(3) of the Act and this part and as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Copper subloops.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to a copper subloop on an unbundled basis. A copper subloop is a portion of a copper loop, or hybrid loop, comprised entirely of copper wire or copper cable that acts as a transmission facility between any point of technically feasible access in an incumbent LEC's outside plant, including inside wire owned or controlled by the incumbent LEC, and the end-user customer premises. A copper subloop includes all intermediate devices (including repeaters and load coils) used to establish a transmission path between a point of technically feasible access and the demarcation point at the end-user customer premises, and includes the features, functions, and capabilities of the copper loop. Copper subloops include two-wire and four-wire analog voice-grade subloops as well as two-wire and four-wire subloops conditioned to transmit the digital signals needed to provide digital subscriber line services, regardless of whether the subloops are in service or held as spares.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Point of technically feasible access.</E> A point of technically feasible access is any point in the incumbent LEC's outside plant where a technician can access the copper wire within a cable without removing a splice case. Such points include, but are not limited to, a pole or pedestal, the serving area interface, the network interface device, the minimum point of entry, any remote terminal, and the feeder/distribution interface. An incumbent LEC shall, upon a site-specific request, provide access to a copper subloop at a splice near a remote terminal. The incumbent LEC shall be compensated for providing this access in accordance with §§ 51.501 through 51.515.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Rules for collocation.</E> Access to the copper subloop is subject to the Commission's collocation rules at §§ 51.321 and 51.323.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Subloops for access to multiunit premises wiring.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to the subloop for access to multiunit premises wiring on an unbundled basis regardless of the capacity level or type of loop that the requesting telecommunications carrier seeks to provision for its customer. The subloop for access to multiunit premises wiring is defined as any portion of the loop that it is technically feasible to access at a terminal in the incumbent LEC's outside plant at or near a multiunit premises. One category of this subloop is inside wire, which is defined for purposes of this section as all loop plant owned or controlled by the incumbent LEC at a multiunit customer premises between the minimum point of entry as defined in § 68.105 of this chapter and the point of demarcation of the incumbent LEC's network as defined in § 68.3 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Point of technically feasible access.</E> A point of technically feasible access is any point in the incumbent LEC's outside plant at or near a multiunit premises where a technician can access the wire or fiber within the cable without removing a splice case to reach the wire or fiber within to access the wiring in the multiunit premises. Such points include, but are not limited to, a pole or pedestal, the network interface device, the minimum point of entry, the single point of interconnection, and the feeder/distribution interface.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Single point of interconnection.</E> Upon notification by a requesting telecommunications carrier that it requests interconnection at a multiunit premises where the incumbent LEC <PRTPAGE P="33"/>owns, controls, or leases wiring, the incumbent LEC shall provide a single point of interconnection that is suitable for use by multiple carriers. This obligation is in addition to the incumbent LEC's obligations, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, to provide nondiscriminatory access to a subloop for access to multiunit premises wiring, including any inside wire, at any technically feasible point. If the parties are unable to negotiate rates, terms, and conditions under which the incumbent LEC will provide this single point of interconnection, then any issues in dispute regarding this obligation shall be resolved in state proceedings under section 252 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other subloop provisions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Technical feasibility.</E> If parties are unable to reach agreement through voluntary negotiations as to whether it is technically feasible, or whether sufficient space is available, to unbundle a copper subloop or subloop for access to multiunit premises wiring at the point where a telecommunications carrier requests, the incumbent LEC shall have the burden of demonstrating to the state commission, in state proceedings under section 252 of the Act, that there is not sufficient space available, or that it is not technically feasible to unbundle the subloop at the point requested.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Best practices.</E> Once one state commission has determined that it is technically feasible to unbundle subloops at a designated point, an incumbent LEC in any state shall have the burden of demonstrating to the state commission, in state proceedings under section 252 of the Act, that it is not technically feasible, or that sufficient space is not available, to unbundle its own loops at such a point.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Network interface device.</E> Apart from its obligation to provide the network interface device functionality as part of an unbundled loop or subloop, an incumbent LEC also shall provide nondiscriminatory access to the network interface device on an unbundled basis, in accordance with section 251(c)(3) of the Act and this part. The network interface device element is a stand-alone network element and is defined as any means of interconnection of customer premises wiring to the incumbent LEC's distribution plant, such as a cross-connect device used for that purpose. An incumbent LEC shall permit a requesting telecommunications carrier to connect its own loop facilities to on-premises wiring through the incumbent LEC's network interface device, or at any other technically feasible point.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Dedicated transport.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to dedicated transport on an unbundled basis, in accordance with section 251(c)(3) of the Act and this part, as set forth in paragraphs (d) through (d)(4) of this section. A “route” is a transmission path between one of an incumbent LEC's wire centers or switches and another of the incumbent LEC's wire centers or switches. A route between two points (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wire center or switch “A” and wire center or switch “Z”) may pass through one or more intermediate wire centers or switches (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wire center or switch “X”). Transmission paths between identical end points (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wire center or switch “A” and wire center or switch “Z”) are the same “route,” irrespective of whether they pass through the same intermediate wire centers or switches, if any.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of this section, dedicated transport includes incumbent LEC transmission facilities between wire centers or switches owned by incumbent LECs, or between wire centers or switches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned by requesting telecommunications carriers, including, but not limited to, DS1-, DS3-, and OCn-capacity level services, as well as dark fiber, dedicated to a particular customer or carrier.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Availability.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Entrance facilities.</E> An incumbent LEC is not obligated to provide a requesting carrier with unbundled access to dedicated transport that does not connect a pair of incumbent LEC wire centers.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Dedicated DS1 transport.</E> Dedicated DS1 transport shall be made available to requesting carriers on an unbundled basis as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. <PRTPAGE P="34"/>Dedicated DS1 transport consists of incumbent LEC interoffice transmission facilities that have a total digital signal speed of 1.544 megabytes per second and are dedicated to a particular customer or carrier.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">General availability of DS1 transport.</E> Incumbent LECs shall unbundle DS1 transport between any pair of incumbent LEC wire centers except where, through application of tier classifications described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, both wire centers defining the route are Tier 1 wire centers. As such, an incumbent LEC must unbundle DS1 transport if a wire center at either end of a requested route is not a Tier 1 wire center, or if neither is a Tier 1 wire center.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Cap on unbundled DS1 transport circuits.</E> A requesting telecommunications carrier may obtain a maximum of ten unbundled DS1 dedicated transport circuits on each route where DS1 dedicated transport is available on an unbundled basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Dedicated DS3 transport.</E> Dedicated DS3 transport shall be made available to requesting carriers on an unbundled basis as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and(B) of this section. Dedicated DS3 transport consists of incumbent LEC interoffice transmission facilities that have a total digital signal speed of 44.736 megabytes per second and are dedicated to a particular customer or carrier.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">General availability of DS3 transport.</E> Incumbent LECs shall unbundle DS3 transport between any pair of incumbent LEC wire centers except where, through application of tier classifications described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, both wire centers defining the route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 wire centers. As such, an incumbent LEC must unbundle DS3 transport if a wire center on either end of a requested route is a Tier 3 wire center.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Cap on unbundled DS3 transport circuits.</E> A requesting telecommunications carrier may obtain a maximum of 12 unbundled DS3 dedicated transport circuits on each route where DS3 dedicated transport is available on an unbundled basis.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Dark fiber transport.</E> Dark fiber transport consists of unactivated optical interoffice transmission facilities. Incumbent LECs shall unbundle dark fiber transport between any pair of incumbent LEC wire centers except where, through application of tier classifications described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, both wire centers defining the route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 wire centers. An incumbent LEC must unbundle dark fiber transport if a wire center on either end of a requested route is a Tier 3 wire center.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Wire center tier structure.</E> For purposes of this section, incumbent LEC wire centers shall be classified into three tiers, defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Tier 1 wire centers are those incumbent LEC wire centers that contain at least four fiber-based collocators, at least 38,000 business lines, or both. Tier 1 wire centers also are those incumbent LEC tandem switching locations that have no line-side switching facilities, but nevertheless serve as a point of traffic aggregation accessible by competitive LECs. Once a wire center is determined to be a Tier 1 wire center, that wire center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 2 or Tier 3 wire center.</P>
              <P>(ii) Tier 2 wire centers are those incumbent LEC wire centers that are not Tier 1 wire centers, but contain at least 3 fiber-based collocators, at least 24,000 business lines, or both. Once a wire center is determined to be a Tier 2 wire center, that wire center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 3 wire center.</P>
              <P>(iii) Tier 3 wire centers are those incumbent LEC wire centers that do not meet the criteria for Tier 1 or Tier 2 wire centers.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Routine network modifications.</E> (i) An incumbent LEC shall make all routine network modifications to unbundled dedicated transport facilities used by requesting telecommunications carriers where the requested dedicated transport facilities have already been constructed. An incumbent LEC shall perform all routine network modifications to unbundled dedicated transport facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without regard to whether the facility being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.</P>

              <P>(ii) A routine network modification is an activity that the incumbent LEC <PRTPAGE P="35"/>regularly undertakes for its own customers. Routine network modifications include, but are not limited to, rearranging or splicing of cable; adding an equipment case; adding a doubler or repeater; installing a repeater shelf; and deploying a new multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer. They also include activities needed to enable a requesting telecommunications carrier to light a dark fiber transport facility. Routine network modifications may entail activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable, and installing equipment casings. Routine network modifications do not include the installation of new aerial or buried cable for a requesting telecommunications carrier.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">911 and E911 databases.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to 911 and E911 databases on an unbundled basis, in accordance with section 251(c)(3) of the Act and this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Operations support systems.</E> An incumbent LEC shall provide a requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to operations support systems on an unbundled basis, in accordance with section 251(c)(3) of the Act and this part. Operations support system functions consist of pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, maintenance and repair, and billing functions supported by an incumbent LEC's databases and information. An incumbent LEC, as part of its duty to provide access to the pre-ordering function, shall provide the requesting telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to the same detailed information about the loop that is available to the incumbent LEC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Methods of obtaining interconnection and access to unbundled elements under section 251 of the Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an incumbent LEC shall provide, on terms and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the requirements of this part, any technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at a particular point upon a request by a telecommunications carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) Technically feasible methods of obtaining interconnection or access to unbundled network elements include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Physical collocation and virtual collocation at the premises of an incumbent LEC; and</P>
              <P>(2) Meet point interconnection arrangements.</P>

              <P>(c) A previously successful method of obtaining interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at a particular premises or point on any incumbent LEC's network is substantial evidence that such method is technically feasible in the case of substantially similar network premises or points. A requesting telecommunications carrier seeking a particular collocation arrangement, either physical or virtual, is entitled to a presumption that such arrangement is technically feasible if any LEC has deployed such collocation arrangement in any incumbent LEC premises.<PRTPAGE P="36"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) An incumbent LEC that denies a request for a particular method of obtaining interconnection or access to unbundled network elements on the incumbent LEC's network must prove to the state commission that the requested method of obtaining interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at that point is not technically feasible.</P>
              <P>(e) An incumbent LEC shall not be required to provide for physical collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the incumbent LEC's premises if it demonstrates to the state commission that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations. In such cases, the incumbent LEC shall be required to provide virtual collocation, except at points where the incumbent LEC proves to the state commission that virtual collocation is not technically feasible. If virtual collocation is not technically feasible, the incumbent LEC shall provide other methods of interconnection and access to unbundled network elements to the extent technically feasible.</P>
              <P>(f) An incumbent LEC shall submit to the state commission, subject to any protective order as the state commission may deem necessary, detailed floor plans or diagrams of any premises where the incumbent LEC claims that physical collocation is not practical because of space limitations. These floor plans or diagrams must show what space, if any, the incumbent LEC or any of its affiliates has reserved for future use, and must describe in detail the specific future uses for which the space has been reserved and the length of time for each reservation. An incumbent LEC that contends space for physical collocation is not available in an incumbent LEC premises must also allow the requesting carrier to tour the entire premises in question, not only the area in which space was denied, without charge, within ten days of the receipt of the incumbent's denial of space. An incumbent LEC must allow a requesting telecommunications carrier reasonable access to its selected collocation space during construction.</P>
              <P>(g) An incumbent LEC that is classified as a Class A company under § 32.11 of this chapter and that is not a National Exchange Carrier Association interstate tariff participant as provided in part 69, subpart G, shall continue to provide expanded interconnection service pursuant to interstate tariff in accordance with §§ 64.1401, 64.1402, 69.121 of this chapter, and the Commission's other requirements.</P>
              <P>(h) Upon request, an incumbent LEC must submit to the requesting carrier within ten days of the submission of the request a report describing in detail the space that is available for collocation in a particular incumbent LEC premises. This report must specify the amount of collocation space available at each requested premises, the number of collocators, and any modifications in the use of the space since the last report. This report must also include measures that the incumbent LEC is taking to make additional space available for collocation. The incumbent LEC must maintain a publicly available document, posted for viewing on the incumbent LEC's publicly available Internet site, indicating all premises that are full, and must update such a document within ten days of the date at which a premises runs out of physical collocation space.</P>
              <P>(i) An incumbent LEC must, upon request, remove obsolete unused equipment from their premises to increase the amount of space available for collocation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards for physical collocation and virtual collocation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An incumbent LEC shall provide physical collocation and virtual collocation to requesting telecommunications carriers.</P>
              <P>(b) An incumbent LEC shall permit the collocation and use of any equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements.</P>

              <P>(1) Equipment is necessary for interconnection if an inability to deploy that equipment would, as a practical, <PRTPAGE P="37"/>economic, or operational matter, preclude the requesting carrier from obtaining interconnection with the incumbent LEC at a level equal in quality to that which the incumbent obtains within its own network or the incumbent provides to any affiliate, subsidiary, or other party.</P>
              <P>(2) Equipment is necessary for access to an unbundled network element if an inability to deploy that equipment would, as a practical, economic, or operational matter, preclude the requesting carrier from obtaining nondiscriminatory access to that unbundled network element, including any of its features, functions, or capabilities.</P>
              <P>(3) Multi-functional equipment shall be deemed necessary for interconnection or access to an unbundled network element if and only if the primary purpose and function of the equipment, as the requesting carrier seeks to deploy it, meets either or both of the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. For a piece of equipment to be utilized primarily to obtain equal in quality interconnection or nondiscriminatory access to one or more unbundled network elements, there also must be a logical nexus between the additional functions the equipment would perform and the telecommunication services the requesting carrier seeks to provide to its customers by means of the interconnection or unbundled network element. The collocation of those functions of the equipment that, as stand-alone functions, do not meet either of the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section must not cause the equipment to significantly increase the burden on the incumbent's property.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever an incumbent LEC objects to collocation of equipment by a requesting telecommunications carrier for purposes within the scope of section 251(c)(6) of the Act, the incumbent LEC shall prove to the state commission that the equipment is not necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements under the standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. An incumbent LEC may not object to the collocation of equipment on the grounds that the equipment does not comply with safety or engineering standards that are more stringent than the safety or engineering standards that the incumbent LEC applies to its own equipment. An incumbent LEC may not object to the collocation of equipment on the ground that the equipment fails to comply with Network Equipment and Building Specifications performance standards or any other performance standards. An incumbent LEC that denies collocation of a competitor's equipment, citing safety standards, must provide to the competitive LEC within five business days of the denial a list of all equipment that the incumbent LEC locates at the premises in question, together with an affidavit attesting that all of that equipment meets or exceeds the safety standard that the incumbent LEC contends the competitor's equipment fails to meet. This affidavit must set forth in detail: the exact safety requirement that the requesting carrier's equipment does not satisfy; the incumbent LEC's basis for concluding that the requesting carrier's equipment does not meet this safety requirement; and the incumbent LEC's basis for concluding why collocation of equipment not meeting this safety requirement would compromise network safety.</P>
              <P>(d) When an incumbent LEC provides physical collocation, virtual collocation, or both, the incumbent LEC shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Provide an interconnection point or points, physically accessible by both the incumbent LEC and the collocating telecommunications carrier, at which the fiber optic cable carrying an interconnector's circuits can enter the incumbent LEC's premises, provided that the incumbent LEC shall designate interconnection points as close as reasonably possible to its premises;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide at least two such interconnection points at each incumbent LEC premises at which there are at least two entry points for the incumbent LEC's cable facilities, and at which space is available for new facilities in at least two of those entry points;</P>

              <P>(3) Permit interconnection of copper or coaxial cable if such interconnection is first approved by the state commission; and<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Permit physical collocation of microwave transmission facilities except where such collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations, in which case virtual collocation of such facilities is required where technically feasible.</P>
              <P>(e) When providing virtual collocation, an incumbent LEC shall, at a minimum, install, maintain, and repair collocated equipment meeting the standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section within the same time periods and with failure rates that are no greater than those that apply to the performance of similar functions for comparable equipment of the incumbent LEC itself.</P>
              <P>(f) An incumbent LEC shall provide space for the collocation of equipment meeting the standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) An incumbent LEC shall make space available within or on its premises to requesting telecommunications carriers on a first-come, first-served basis, provided, however, that the incumbent LEC shall not be required to lease or construct additional space to provide for physical collocation when existing space has been exhausted;</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent possible, an incumbent LEC shall make contiguous space available to requesting telecommunications carriers that seek to expand their existing collocation space;</P>
              <P>(3) When planning renovations of existing facilities or constructing or leasing new facilities, an incumbent LEC shall take into account projected demand for collocation of equipment;</P>
              <P>(4) An incumbent LEC may retain a limited amount of floor space for its own specific future uses, provided, however, that neither the incumbent LEC nor any of its affiliates may reserve space for future use on terms more favorable than those that apply to other telecommunications carriers seeking to reserve collocation space for their own future use;</P>
              <P>(5) An incumbent LEC shall relinquish any space held for future use before denying a request for virtual collocation on the grounds of space limitations, unless the incumbent LEC proves to the state commission that virtual collocation at that point is not technically feasible; and</P>
              <P>(6) An incumbent LEC may impose reasonable restrictions on the warehousing of unused space by collocating telecommunications carriers, provided, however, that the incumbent LEC shall not set maximum space limitations applicable to such carriers unless the incumbent LEC proves to the state commission that space constraints make such restrictions necessary.</P>
              <P>(7) An incumbent LEC must assign collocation space to requesting carriers in a just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory manner. An incumbent LEC must allow each carrier requesting physical collocation to submit space preferences prior to assigning physical collocation space to that carrier. At a minimum, an incumbent LEC's space assignment policies and practices must meet the following principles:</P>
              <P>(A) An incumbent LEC's space assignment policies and practices must not materially increase a requesting carrier's collocation costs.</P>
              <P>(B) An incumbent LEC's space assignment policies and practices must not materially delay a requesting carrier occupation and use of the incumbent LEC's premises.</P>
              <P>(C) An incumbent LEC must not assign physical collocation space that will impair the quality of service or impose other limitations on the service a requesting carrier wishes to offer.</P>
              <P>(D) An incumbent LEC's space assignment policies and practices must not reduce unreasonably the total space available for physical collocation or preclude unreasonably physical collocation within the incumbent's premises.</P>
              <P>(g) An incumbent LEC shall permit collocating telecommunications carriers to collocate equipment and connect such equipment to unbundled network transmission elements obtained from the incumbent LEC, and shall not require such telecommunications carriers to bring their own transmission facilities to the incumbent LEC's premises in which they seek to collocate equipment.</P>

              <P>(h) As described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section, an incumbent LEC <PRTPAGE P="39"/>shall permit a collocating telecommunications carrier to interconnect its network with that of another collocating telecommunications carrier at the incumbent LEC's premises and to connect its collocated equipment to the collocated equipment of another telecommunications carrier within the same premises, provided that the collocated equipment is also used for interconnection with the incumbent LEC or for access to the incumbent LEC's unbundled network elements.</P>
              <P>(1) An incumbent LEC shall provide, at the request of a collocating telecommunications carrier, a connection between the equipment in the collocated spaces of two or more telecommunications carriers, except to the extent the incumbent LEC permits the collocating parties to provide the requested connection for themselves or a connection is not required under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Where technically feasible, the incumbent LEC shall provide the connection using copper, dark fiber, lit fiber, or other transmission medium, as requested by the collocating telecommunications carrier.</P>
              <P>(2) An incumbent LEC is not required to provide a connection between the equipment in the collocated spaces of two or more telecommunications carriers if the connection is requested pursuant to section 201 of the Act, unless the requesting carrier submits to the incumbent LEC a certification that more than 10 percent of the amount of traffic to be transmitted through the connection will be interstate. The incumbent LEC cannot refuse to accept the certification, but instead must provision the service promptly. Any incumbent LEC may file a section 208 complaint with the Commission challenging the certification if it believes that the certification is deficient. No such certification is required for a request for such connection under section 251 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(i) As provided herein, an incumbent LEC may require reasonable security arrangements to protect its equipment and ensure network reliability. An incumbent LEC may only impose security arrangements that are as stringent as the security arrangements that the incumbent LEC maintains at its own premises for its own employees or authorized contractors. An incumbent LEC must allow collocating parties to access their collocated equipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without requiring either a security escort of any kind or delaying a competitor's employees' entry into the incumbent LEC's premises. An incumbent LEC may require a collocating carrier to pay only for the least expensive, effective security option that is viable for the physical collocation space assigned. Reasonable security measures that the incumbent LEC may adopt include:</P>
              <P>(1) Installing security cameras or other monitoring systems; or</P>
              <P>(2) Requiring competitive LEC personnel to use badges with computerized tracking systems; or</P>
              <P>(3) Requiring competitive LEC employees to undergo the same level of security training, or its equivalent, that the incumbent's own employees, or third party contractors providing similar functions, must undergo; provided, however, that the incumbent LEC may not require competitive LEC employees to receive such training from the incumbent LEC itself, but must provide information to the competitive LEC on the specific type of training required so the competitive LEC's employees can conduct their own training.</P>
              <P>(4) Restricting physical collocation to space separated from space housing the incumbent LEC's equipment, provided that each of the following conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(i) Either legitimate security concerns, or operational constraints unrelated to the incumbent's or any of its affiliates' or subsidiaries competitive concerns, warrant such separation;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any physical collocation space assigned to an affiliate or subsidiary of the incumbent LEC is separated from space housing the incumbent LEC's equipment;</P>
              <P>(iii) The separated space will be available in the same time frame as, or a shorter time frame than, non-separated space;</P>

              <P>(iv) The cost of the separated space to the requesting carrier will not be <PRTPAGE P="40"/>materially higher than the cost of non-separated space; and</P>
              <P>(v) The separated space is comparable, from a technical and engineering standpoint, to non-separated space.</P>
              <P>(5) Requiring the employees and contractors of collocating carriers to use a central or separate entrance to the incumbent's building, provided, however, that where an incumbent LEC requires that the employees or contractors of collocating carriers access collocated equipment only through a separate entrance, employees and contractors of the incumbent LEC's affiliates and subsidiaries must be subject to the same restriction.</P>
              <P>(6) Constructing or requiring the construction of a separate entrance to access physical collocation space, provided that each of the following conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(i) Construction of a separate entrance is technically feasible;</P>
              <P>(ii) Either legitimate security concerns, or operational constraints unrelated to the incumbent's or any of its affiliates' or subsidiaries competitive concerns, warrant such separation;</P>
              <P>(iii) Construction of a separate entrance will not artificially delay collocation provisioning; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Construction of a separate entrance will not materially increase the requesting carrier's costs.</P>
              <P>(j) An incumbent LEC shall permit a collocating telecommunications carrier to subcontract the construction of physical collocation arrangements with contractors approved by the incumbent LEC, provided, however, that the incumbent LEC shall not unreasonably withhold approval of contractors. Approval by an incumbent LEC shall be based on the same criteria it uses in approving contractors for its own purposes.</P>
              <P>(k) An incumbent LEC's physical collocation offering must include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Shared collocation cages.</E> A shared collocation cage is a caged collocation space shared by two or more competitive LECs pursuant to terms and conditions agreed to by the competitive LECs. In making shared cage arrangements available, an incumbent LEC may not increase the cost of site preparation or nonrecurring charges above the cost for provisioning such a cage of similar dimensions and material to a single collocating party. In addition, the incumbent must prorate the charge for site conditioning and preparation undertaken by the incumbent to construct the shared collocation cage or condition the space for collocation use, regardless of how many carriers actually collocate in that cage, by determining the total charge for site preparation and allocating that charge to a collocating carrier based on the percentage of the total space utilized by that carrier. An incumbent LEC must make shared collocation space available in single-bay increments or their equivalent, i.e., a competing carrier can purchase space in increments small enough to collocate a single rack, or bay, of equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cageless collocation.</E> Incumbent LECs must allow competitors to collocate without requiring the construction of a cage or similar structure. Incumbent LECs must permit collocating carriers to have direct access to their equipment. An incumbent LEC may not require competitors to use an intermediate interconnection arrangement in lieu of direct connection to the incumbent's network if technically feasible. An incumbent LEC must make cageless collocation space available in single-bay increments, meaning that a competing carrier can purchase space in increments small enough to collocate a single rack, or bay, of equipment.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjacent space collocation.</E> An incumbent LEC must make available, where physical collocation space is legitimately exhausted in a particular incumbent LEC structure, collocation in adjacent controlled environmental vaults, controlled environmental huts, or similar structures located at the incumbent LEC premises to the extent technically feasible. The incumbent LEC must permit a requesting telecommunications carrier to construct or otherwise procure such an adjacent structure, subject only to reasonable safety and maintenance requirements. The incumbent must provide power and physical collocation services and facilities, subject to the same nondiscrimination requirements as applicable to any other physical collocation <PRTPAGE P="41"/>arrangement. The incumbent LEC must permit the requesting carrier to place its own equipment, including, but not limited to, copper cables, coaxial cables, fiber cables, and telecommunications equipment, in adjacent facilities constructed by the incumbent LEC, the requesting carrier, or a third-party. If physical collocation space becomes available in a previously exhausted incumbent LEC structure, the incumbent LEC must not require a carrier to move, or prohibit a competitive LEC from moving, a collocation arrangement into that structure. Instead, the incumbent LEC must continue to allow the carrier to collocate in any adjacent controlled environmental vault, controlled environmental vault, or similar structure that the carrier has constructed or otherwise procured.</P>

              <P>(l) An incumbent LEC must offer to provide and provide all forms of physical collocation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> caged, cageless, shared, and adjacent) within the following deadlines, except to the extent a state sets its own deadlines or the incumbent LEC has demonstrated to the state commission that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations.</P>
              <P>(1) Within ten days after receiving an application for physical collocation, an incumbent LEC must inform the requesting carrier whether the application meets each of the incumbent LEC's established collocation standards. A requesting carrier that resubmits a revised application curing any deficiencies in an application for physical collocation within ten days after being informed of them retains its position within any collocation queue that the incumbent LEC maintains pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as stated in paragraphs (l)(3) and (l)(4) of this section, an incumbent LEC must complete provisioning of a requested physical collocation arrangement within 90 days after receiving an application that meets the incumbent LEC's established collocation application standards.</P>
              <P>(3) An incumbent LEC need not meet the deadline set forth in paragraph (l)(2) of this section if, after receipt of any price quotation provided by the incumbent LEC, the telecommunications carrier requesting collocation does not notify the incumbent LEC that physical collocation should proceed.</P>
              <P>(4) If, within seven days of the requesting carrier's receipt of any price quotation provided by the incumbent LEC, the telecommunications carrier requesting collocation does not notify the incumbent LEC that physical collocation should proceed, then the incumbent LEC need not complete provisioning of a requested physical collocation arrangement until 90 days after receiving such notification from the requesting telecommunications carrier.</P>

              <P>(a) In providing the required notice to the public of network changes, an incumbent LEC may use one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(1) Filing a public notice with the Commission; or</P>
              <P>(2) Providing public notice through industry fora, industry publications, or the carrier's publicly accessible Internet site. If an incumbent LEC uses any of the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it also must file a certification with the Commission that includes:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement that identifies the proposed changes;</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement that public notice has been given in compliance with §§ 51.325 through 51.335; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement identifying the location of the change information and describing how this information can be obtained.</P>
              <P>(b) Until the planned change is implemented, an incumbent LEC must keep the notice available for public inspection, and amend the notice to keep the information complete, accurate and up-to-date.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific filing requirements.</E> Commission filings under this section must be made as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The public notice or certification must be labeled with one of the following titles, as appropriate: “Public Notice of Network Change Under Rule 51.329(a),” “Certification of Public Notice of Network Change Under Rule 51.329(a),” “Short Term Public Notice Under Rule 51.333(a),” “Certification of Short Term Public Notice Under Rule 51.333(a),” “Public Notice of Copper Retirement Under Rule 51.333,” or “Certification of Public Notice of Copper Retirement Under Rule 51.333.”</P>
              <P>(2) The incumbent LEC's public notice and any associated certifications shall be filed through the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), using the “Submit a Non-Docketed Filing” module. All subsequent filings responsive to a notice may be filed using the Commission's ECFS under the docket number set forth in the Commission's public notice for the proceeding. If necessary, subsequent filings responsive to a notice also may be filed by sending one paper copy of the filing to “Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554” and one paper copy of the filing to “Federal Communications Commission, Wireline Competition Bureau, Competition Policy Division, Washington, DC 20554.” For notices filed using the Commission's ECFS, the date on which the filing is received by that system will be considered the official filing date. For notices filed via paper copy, the date on which the filing is received by the Secretary or the FCC Mailroom is considered the official filing date. All subsequent filings responsive to a notice shall refer to the ECFS docket number assigned to the notice.</P>

              <P>(a) An incumbent LEC shall give public notice of planned changes at the make/buy point, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, but at least 12 months before implementation, except as provided below:</P>
              <P>(1) If the changes can be implemented within twelve months of the make/buy point, public notice must be given at the make/buy point, but at least six months before implementation.</P>
              <P>(2) If the changes can be implemented within six months of the make/buy point, public notice may be given pursuant to the short term notice procedures provided in § 51.333.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, the <E T="03">make/buy point</E> is the time at which an incumbent LEC decides to make for itself, or to procure from another entity, any product the design of which affects or relies on a new or changed network interface. If an incumbent LEC's planned changes do not require it to make or to procure a product, then the make/buy point is the point at which the incumbent LEC makes a definite decision to implement a network change.</P>
              <P>(1) For purposes of this section, a <E T="03">product</E> is any hardware r software for use in an incumbent LEC's network or in conjunction with its facilities that, when installed, could affect the compatibility of an interconnected service provider's network, facilities or services with an incumbent LEC's existing telephone network, facilities or services, or with any of an incumbent carrier's services or capabilities.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this section a <E T="03">definite decision</E> is reached when an incumbent LEC determines that the change is warranted, establishes a timetable for anticipated implementation, and takes any action toward implementation of the change within its network.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Resolution of objections to copper retirement notices.</E> An objection to a notice that an incumbent LEC intends to retire copper, as defined in § 51.325(a)(3) shall be deemed denied 90 days after the date on which the Commission releases public notice of the incumbent LEC filing, unless the Commission rules otherwise within that time. Until the Commission has either ruled on an objection or the 90-day period for the Commission's consideration has expired, an incumbent LEC may not retire those copper facilities at issue.</P>
              <P>(g)<E T="03"> Limited exemption from advance notice and timing requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Force majeure events.</E> (i) Notwithstanding the <PRTPAGE P="45"/>requirements of this section, if in response to a force majeure event, an incumbent LEC invokes its disaster recovery plan, the incumbent LEC will be exempted during the period when the plan is invoked (up to a maximum 180 days) from all advanced notice and waiting period requirements under this section associated with network changes that result from or are necessitated as a direct result of the force majeure event.</P>
              <P>(ii) As soon as practicable, during the exemption period, the incumbent LEC must continue to comply with § 51.325(a), include in its public notice the date on which the carrier invoked its disaster recovery plan, and must communicate with other directly interconnected telephone exchange service providers to ensure that such carriers are aware of any changes being made to their networks that may impact those carriers' operations.</P>
              <P>(iii) If an incumbent LEC requires relief from the notice requirements under this section longer than 180 days after it invokes the disaster recovery plan, the incumbent LEC must request such authority from the Commission. Any such request must be accompanied by a status report describing the incumbent LEC's progress and providing an estimate of when the incumbent LEC expects to be able to resume compliance with the notice requirements under this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) A short term network change or copper retirement notice subject to paragraph (g)(2) of this section must include a brief explanation of the circumstances necessitating the reduced waiting period and how the incumbent LEC intends to minimize the impact of the reduced waiting period on directly interconnected telephone exchange service providers.</P>
              <P>(iii) For purposes of this section, circumstances outside of the incumbent LEC's control include federal, state, or local municipal mandates and unintentional damage to the incumbent LEC's network facilities not caused by the incumbent LEC.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Total element long-run incremental cost.</E> The total element long-run incremental cost of an element is the forward-looking cost over the long run of the total quantity of the facilities and functions that are directly attributable to, or reasonably identifiable as incremental to, such element, calculated taking as a given the incumbent LEC's provision of other elements.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Efficient network configuration.</E> The total element long-run incremental cost of an element should be measured based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the lowest cost network configuration, given the existing location of the incumbent LEC's wire centers.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cost study requirements.</E> An incumbent LEC must prove to the state commission that the rates for each element it offers do not exceed the forward-looking economic cost per unit of providing the element, using a cost study that complies with the methodology set forth in this section and § 51.511.</P>
              <P>(1) A state commission may set a rate outside the proxy ranges or above the proxy ceilings described in § 51.513 only if that commission has given full and fair effect to the economic cost based pricing methodology described in this section and § 51.511 in a state proceeding that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>

If a flat-rated charge is established for these components, it shall be converted to a per-minute rate by dividing the projected average minutes of use per flat-rated subelement, for purposes of assessing compliance with this proxy. A weighted average of such flat-rate or usage-sensitive charges shall be used in appropriate circumstances, such as when peak and off-peak charges are used.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Cross-class selling.</E> A state commission may permit an incumbent LEC to prohibit a requesting telecommunications carrier that purchases at wholesale rates for resale, telecommunications services that the incumbent LEC makes available only to residential customers or to a limited class of residential customers, from offering such services to classes of customers that are not eligible to subscribe to such services from the incumbent LEC.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Short term promotions.</E> An incumbent LEC shall apply the wholesale discount to the ordinary rate for a retail service rather than a special promotional rate only if:</P>
              <P>(i) Such promotions involve rates that will be in effect for no more than 90 days; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The incumbent LEC does not use such promotional offerings to evade the wholesale rate obligation, for example by making available a sequential series of 90-day promotional rates.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to any restrictions on resale not permitted under paragraph (a), an incumbent LEC may impose a restriction only if it proves to the state commission that the restriction is reasonable and nondiscriminatory.</P>

              <P>(1) An incumbent LEC may impose such a restriction only if it proves to the state commission that the restriction is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, such as by proving to a state commission that the incumbent LEC lacks the capability to comply with unbranding or rebranding requests.</P>

              <P>(a) Effective December 29, 2011, compensation for telecommunications traffic exchanged between two telecommunications carriers that is interstate or intrastate exchange access, information access, or exchange services for such access, other than special access, is specified in subpart J of this part. The provisions of this subpart apply to Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic between LECs and other telecommunications carriers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic.</E> For purposes of this subpart, Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic means:</P>

              <P>(1) Telecommunications traffic exchanged between a LEC and a telecommunications carrier other than a CMRS provider, except for telecommunications traffic that is interstate or intrastate exchange access, information access, or exchange services for such access (<E T="03">see</E> FCC 01-131, paragraphs 34, 36, 39, 42-43); or</P>
              <P>(2) Telecommunications traffic exchanged between a LEC and a CMRS provider that, at the beginning of the call, originates and terminates within the same Major Trading Area, as defined in § 24.202(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) This definition includes telecommunications traffic exchanged between a LEC and another telecommunications carrier in Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) format that originates and/or terminates in IP format and that otherwise meets the definitions in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. Telecommunications traffic originates and/or terminates in IP format if it originates from and/or terminates to an end-user customer of a service that requires Internet protocol-compatible customer premises equipment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transport.</E> For purposes of this subpart, transport is the transmission and any necessary tandem switching of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic subject to section 251(b)(5) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 251(b)(5), from the interconnection point between the two carriers to the terminating carrier's end office switch that directly serves the called party, or equivalent facility provided by a carrier other than an incumbent LEC.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination.</E> For purposes of this subpart, termination is the switching of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic at the terminating carrier's end office switch, or equivalent facility, and delivery of such traffic to the called party's premises.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation.</E> For purposes of this subpart, a Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation arrangement between two carriers is either a bill-and-keep arrangement, per § 51.713, or an arrangement in which each carrier receives intercarrier compensation for the transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic.</P>

              <P>(a) Each LEC shall establish Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation arrangements for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic with any requesting telecommunications carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) A LEC may not assess charges on any other telecommunications carrier for Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic that originates on the LEC's network.</P>

              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, a LEC shall be entitled to assess and collect the full charges for the transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic, regardless of whether the local exchange carrier assessing the applicable charges itself delivers such traffic to the called party's <PRTPAGE P="55"/>premises or delivers the call to the called party's premises via contractual or other arrangements with an affiliated or unaffiliated provider of interconnected VoIP service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(25), or a non-interconnected VoIP service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(36), that does not itself seek to collect Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation charges for the transport and termination of that Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic. In no event may the total charges that a LEC may assess for such service to the called location exceed the applicable transport and termination rate. For purposes of this section, the facilities used by the LEC and affiliated or unaffiliated provider of interconnected VoIP service or a non-interconnected VoIP service for the transport and termination of such traffic shall be deemed an equivalent facility under § 51.701.</P>

              <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, by default, transport and termination for Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic exchanged between a local exchange carrier and a CMRS provider within the scope of § 51.701(b)(2) shall be pursuant to a bill-and-keep arrangement, as provided in § 51.713.</P>
              <P>(b) Establishment of incumbent LECs' rates for transport and termination:</P>
              <P>(1) This provision applies when, in the absence of a negotiated agreement between parties, state commissions establish Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rates for the exchange of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic between a local exchange carrier and a telecommunications carrier other than a CMRS provider where the incumbent local exchange carriers did not have any such rates as of December 29, 2011. Any rates established pursuant to this provision apply between December 29, 2011 and the date at which they are superseded by the transition specified in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An incumbent LEC's rates for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic shall be established, at the election of the state commission, on the basis of:</P>
              <P>(i) The forward-looking economic costs of such offerings, using a cost study pursuant to §§ 51.505 and 51.511; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A bill-and-keep arrangement, as provided in § 51.713.</P>
              <P>(3) In cases where both carriers in a Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation arrangement are incumbent LECs, state commissions shall establish the rates of the smaller carrier on the basis of the larger carrier's forward-looking costs, pursuant to § 51.711.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, default transitional Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rates shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Effective December 29, 2011, no telecommunications carrier may increase a Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation for transport or termination above the level in effect on December 29, 2011. All Bill-and-Keep Arrangements in effect on December 29, 2011 shall remain in place unless both parties mutually agree to an alternative arrangement.</P>
              <P>(2) Beginning July 1, 2012, if any telecommunications carrier's Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rates in effect on December 29, 2011 or established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section subsequent to December 29, 2011, exceed that carrier's interstate access rates for functionally equivalent services in effect in the same state on December 29, 2011, that carrier shall reduce its reciprocal compensation rate by one half of the difference between the Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rate and the corresponding functionally equivalent interstate access rate.</P>
              <P>(3) Beginning July 1, 2013, no telecommunications carrier's Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rates shall exceed that carrier's tariffed interstate access rate in effect in the same state on January 1 of that same year, for equivalent functionality.</P>

              <P>(4) After July 1, 2018, all Price-Cap Local Exchange Carrier's Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rates and all non-incumbent LECs that benchmark access rates to Price Cap Carrier shall <PRTPAGE P="56"/>be set pursuant to Bill-and-Keep arrangements for Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation as defined in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) After July 1, 2020, all Rate-of-Return Local Exchange Carrier's Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation rates and all non-incumbent LECs that benchmark access rates to Rate-of-Return Carriers shall be set pursuant to Bill-and-Keep arrangements for Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation as defined in this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) In state proceedings, where a rate for Non-Access Reciprocal Compensation does not exist as of December 29, 2011, a state commission shall establish initial rates for the transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic that are structured consistently with the manner that carriers incur those costs, and consistently with the principles in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The rate of a carrier providing transmission facilities dedicated to the transmission of non-access traffic between two carriers' networks shall recover only the costs of the proportion of that trunk capacity used by an interconnecting carrier to send non-access traffic that will terminate on the providing carrier's network. Such proportions may be measured during peak periods.</P>
              <P>(c) For Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic exchanged between a rate-of-return regulated rural telephone company as defined in § 51.5 and a CMRS provider, the rural rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier will be responsible for transport to the CMRS provider's interconnection point when it is located within the rural rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier's service area. When the CMRS provider's interconnection point is located outside the rural rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier's service area, the rural rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier's transport and provisioning obligation stops at its meet point and the CMRS provider is responsible for the remaining transport to its interconnection point. This paragraph (c) is a default provision and applicable in the absence of an existing agreement or arrangement otherwise.</P>

              <P>(a) Rates for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic shall be symmetrical, unless carriers mutually agree otherwise, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) For purposes of this subpart, symmetrical rates are rates that a carrier other than an incumbent LEC assesses upon an incumbent LEC for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic equal to those that the incumbent LEC assesses upon the other carrier for the same services.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases where both parties are incumbent LECs, or neither party is an incumbent LEC, a state commission shall establish the symmetrical rates for transport and termination based on the larger carrier's forward-looking costs.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the switch of a carrier other than an incumbent LEC serves a geographic area comparable to the area served by the incumbent LEC's tandem switch, the appropriate rate for the carrier other than an incumbent LEC is the incumbent LEC's tandem interconnection rate.</P>

              <P>(b) Except as provided in § 51.705, a state commission may establish asymmetrical rates for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic only if the carrier other than the incumbent LEC (or the smaller of two incumbent LECs) proves to the state commission on the basis of a cost study using the forward-looking economic cost based pricing methodology described in §§ 51.505 and 51.511, that the forward-looking costs for a network efficiently configured and operated by the carrier other than the incumbent LEC (or the smaller of two incumbent LECs), exceed the costs incurred by the incumbent LEC (or the larger incumbent LEC), and, consequently, that such that a higher rate is justified.<PRTPAGE P="57"/>

              <P>(a) Upon request from a telecommunications carrier without an existing interconnection arrangement with an incumbent LEC, the incumbent LEC shall provide transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic immediately under an interim arrangement, pending resolution of negotiation or arbitration regarding transport and termination rates and approval of such rates by a state commission under sections 251 and 252 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(1) This requirement shall not apply when the requesting carrier has an existing interconnection arrangement that provides for the transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic by the incumbent LEC.</P>
              <P>(2) A telecommunications carrier may take advantage of such an interim arrangement only after it has requested negotiation with the incumbent LEC pursuant to § 51.301.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon receipt of a request as described in paragraph (a) of this section, an incumbent LEC must, without unreasonable delay, establish an interim arrangement for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic at symmetrical rates.</P>
              <P>(1) In a state in which the state commission has established transport and termination rates based on forward-looking economic cost studies, an incumbent LEC shall use these state-determined rates as interim transport and termination rates.</P>
              <P>(2) In a state in which the state commission has not established transport and termination rates based on forward-looking economic cost studies, an incumbent LEC shall set interim transport and termination rates either at the default ceilings specified in § 51.705(c) or in accordance with a bill-and-keep methodology as defined in § 51.713.</P>
              <P>(3) In a state in which the state commission has neither established transport and termination rates based on forward-looking economic cost studies nor established transport and termination rates consistent with the default price ranges described in § 51.707, an incumbent LEC shall set interim transport and termination rates at the default ceilings for end-office switching (0.4 cents per minute of use), tandem switching (0.15 cents per minute of use), and transport (as described in § 51.707(b)(2)).</P>
              <P>(c) An interim arrangement shall cease to be in effect when one of the following occurs with respect to rates for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic subject to the interim arrangement:</P>
              <P>(1) A voluntary agreement has been negotiated and approved by a state commission;</P>
              <P>(2) An agreement has been arbitrated and approved by a state commission; or</P>
              <P>(3) The period for requesting arbitration has passed with no such request.</P>

              <P>(d) If the rates for transport and termination of Non-Access Telecommunications Traffic in an interim arrangement differ from the rates established by a state commission pursuant to § 51.705, the state commission shall require carriers to make adjustments to past compensation. Such adjustments to past compensation shall allow each <PRTPAGE P="58"/>carrier to receive the level of compensation it would have received had the rates in the interim arrangement equalled the rates later established by the state commission pursuant to § 51.705.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Transition of price cap carrier access charges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, on December 29, 2011, a Price Cap Carrier shall cap the rates for all interstate and intrastate rate elements for services contained in the definitions of Interstate End Office Access Services, Tandem Switched Transport Access Services, and Dedicated Transport Access Services. In addition, a Price Cap Carrier shall also cap the rates for any interstate and intrastate rate elements in the traffic sensitive basket” and the “trunking basket” as described in 47 CFR 61.42(d)(2) and (3) to the extent that such rate elements are not contained in the definitions of Interstate End Office Access Services, Tandem Switched Transport Access Services, and Dedicated Transport Access Services. Carriers will remove these services from price cap regulation in their July 1, 2012 annual tariff filing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Beginning July 1, 2012, notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Each Price Cap Carrier shall file tariffs, in accordance with § 51.905(b)(2), with the appropriate state regulatory authority, that set forth the rates applicable to Transitional Intrastate Access Service in each state in which it provides Transitional Intrastate Access Service.</P>
              <P>(2) Each Price Cap Carrier shall establish the rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service using the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) Calculate total revenue from Transitional Intrastate Access Service at the carrier's interstate access rates in effect on December 29, 2011, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand for each rate element.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calculate total revenue from Transitional Intrastate Access Service at the carrier's intrastate access rates in effect on December 29, 2011, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand for each rate element.</P>
              <P>(iii) Calculate the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction. The Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction is equal to one-half of the difference between the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) A Price Cap Carrier may elect to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service using its intrastate access rate structure. Carriers using this option shall establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service such that Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenue at the proposed rates is no greater than Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenue at the intrastate rates in effect as of December 29, 2011 less the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction, using Fiscal Year 2011 demand. Carriers electing to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service in this manner shall notify the appropriate state regulatory authority of their election in the filing required by § 51.907(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(v) A Price Cap Carrier may elect to apply its interstate access rate structure and interstate rates to Transitional Intrastate Access Service. In addition to applicable interstate access rates, the carrier may, between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013, assess a transitional per-minute charge on Transitional Intrastate Access Service end office switching minutes (previously billed as intrastate access). The transitional per-minute charge shall be no greater than the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction divided by Fiscal Year 2011 Transitional Intrastate Access Service end office switching minutes. Carriers electing to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service in this manner shall notify the appropriate state regulatory authority of their election in the filing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(vi) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, nothing in this <PRTPAGE P="63"/>section obligates or allows a Price Cap Carrier that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions to increase such rates.</P>
              <P>(3) If a Price Cap Carrier must make an intrastate switched access rate reduction pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and that Price Cap Carrier has an intrastate rate for a rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element, the Price Cap Carrier shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Increase the rate for any intrastate rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element to the interstate rate no later than July 1, 2013;</P>
              <P>(ii) Include any increases made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in the calculation of its eligible recovery for 2012.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Beginning July 1, 2013, notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Transitional Intrastate Access Service rates shall be no higher than the Price Cap Carrier's interstate access rates. Once the Price Cap Carrier's Transitional Intrastate Access Service rates are equal to its functionally equivalent interstate access rates, they shall be subject to the same rate structure and all subsequent rate and rate structure modifications. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, nothing in this section obligates or allows a Price Cap Carrier that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions to increase such rates.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases where a Price Cap Carrier does not have intrastate rates that permit it to determine composite intrastate End Office Access Service rates, the carrier shall establish End Office Access Service rates such that the ratio between its composite intrastate End Office Access Service revenues and its total intrastate switched access revenues may not exceed the ratio between its composite interstate End Office Access Service revenues and its total interstate switched access revenues.</P>
              <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(4) If a Price Cap Carrier made an intrastate switched access rate reduction in 2012 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and that Price Cap Carrier has an intrastate rate for a rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element, the Price Cap Carrier shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Increase the rate for any intrastate rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element to the interstate rate on July 1, 2013; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Include any increases made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section in the calculation of its eligible recovery for 2013.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Beginning July 1, 2014, notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules:</P>
              <P>(1) A Price Cap Carrier shall establish separate originating and terminating rate elements for all per-minute components within interstate and intrastate End Office Access Service. For fixed charges, the Price Cap Carrier shall divide the rate between originating and terminating rate elements based on relative originating and terminating end office switching minutes. If sufficient originating and terminating end office switching minute data is not available, the carrier shall divide such charges equally between originating and terminating elements.</P>
              <P>(2) Each Price Cap Carrier shall establish rates for interstate or intrastate terminating End Office Access Service using the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) Each Price Cap Carrier shall calculate the 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. The 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate means the Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate calculated using Fiscal Year 2011 interstate demand multiplied by the interstate End Office Access Service rates at the levels in effect on December 29, 2011, and then dividing the result by 2011 Fiscal Year interstate local switching demand.</P>

              <P>(ii) Each Price Cap Carrier shall calculate its 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. The 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate means $0.0007 <PRTPAGE P="64"/>per minute plus two-thirds of any difference between the 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate and $0.0007 per minute.</P>
              <P>(iii) Beginning July 1, 2014, no Price Cap Carrier's interstate Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate shall exceed its 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate.

              <P>(ii) Using the rate for the applicable rate element if the tariff does not distinguish between originating and terminating.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(6) and (b)(4) of this section, nothing in this section obligates or allows a Rate-of-Return Carrier that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions raising such rates.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a Rate-of-Return Carrier enters or exits the National Exchange Carrier Association (Association), as defined in § 69.2(d) of this chapter, traffic-sensitive tariff pursuant to the provisions of § 69.3(e)(6) of this chapter, the Association shall adjust its switched access rate caps referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For each entering Rate-of-Return Carrier, the Association shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Determine each entering Rate-of-Return Carrier's interstate switched access revenues for the preceding calendar year;</P>

              <P>(B) Determine the revenues that would have been realized by the entering Rate-of-Return Carrier in the preceding calendar year if it had used the Association's switched access rates (employing the rates for the appropriate bands) as of December 31 of the preceding year and the entering Rate-of-Return Carrier's switched access demand used to determine switched access revenues under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section; and<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) Subtract the sum of the revenues determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section from the sum of the revenues determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Association shall determine the amount by which each exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier is a net contributor or net recipient to or from the switched access segment of the Association pool as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The Association shall calculate the difference between each exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier's 2011-2012 tariff year projected interstate switched access revenues excluding Local Switching Support and the Rate-of-Return Carrier's projected switched access pool settlements excluding Local Switching Support for the same period with a net contribution amount being treated as a positive amount and a net recipient amount being treated as a negative amount. The Association shall divide the calculated difference by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's 2011-2012 tariff year projected interstate switched access revenues excluding Local Switching Support to produce a percent net contribution or net receipt factor.</P>
              <P>(B) The Association shall multiply the factor calculated in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's switched access revenues for the preceding calendar year to yield the amount of the Rate-of-Return Carrier's net contribution or net receipts for the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(iii) To determine the Association's adjusted switched access rate caps, the Association shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Add the amounts calculated under paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) Divide the amount determined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section by the preceding year's switched access revenues of the Rate-of-Return Carriers that will participate in the Association traffic-sensitive tariff for the next annual tariff period;</P>
              <P>(C) The Association shall proportionately adjust its June 30 switched access rate caps by the percentage amount determined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) The interstate switched access rate caps determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C) of this section shall be the new capped interstate switched access rates for purposes of § 51.909(a). The Association shall provide support in its annual access tariff filing to justify the revised interstate switched access rate caps, the Access Recovery Charges that will be assessed, and the amount of Connect America Fund ICC support each carrier will be eligible to receive.</P>
              <P>(5) A Rate-of-Return Carrier exiting the Association traffic-sensitive tariff pursuant to § 69.3(e)(6) of this chapter must establish new switched access rate caps as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The Rate-of-Return Carrier shall multiply the factor determined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section by negative one and then proportionately adjust the Association's capped switched access rates as of the date preceding the effective date of the exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier's next annual tariff filing by this percentage. A Rate-of-Return Carrier that was a net contributor to the pool will have rate caps that are lower than the Association's switched access rate caps, while a net recipient will have switched access rate caps that are higher than the Association's switched access rate caps;</P>
              <P>(ii) The interstate switched access rate caps determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section shall be the new capped interstate switched access rates of the exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier for purposes of § 51.909(a). An exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier shall provide support in its annual access tariff filing to justify the revised interstate switched access rate caps, the Access Recovery Charges that will be assessed, and the amount of Connect America Fund ICC support the carrier will be eligible to receive.</P>
              <P>(6) If the Association revises its interstate switched access rate caps pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, each Rate-of-Return Carrier participating in the upcoming annual Association traffic-sensitive tariff shall:</P>

              <P>(i) Revise any of its intrastate switched access rates that would have reached parity with its interstate switched access rates in 2013 to parity with the revised interstate switched access rate levels;<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The Association shall provide Rate-of-Return Carriers that are participating in the Association traffic-sensitive pool with notice of any revisions the Association proposes under paragraph (a)(4) of this section no later than May 1.</P>

              <P>(2) Each Rate-of-Return Carrier shall establish the rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service using the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) Calculate total revenue from Transitional Intrastate Access Service at the carrier's interstate access rates in effect on December 29, 2011, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand for each rate element.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calculate total revenue from Transitional Intrastate Access Service at the carrier's intrastate access rates in effect on December 29, 2011, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand for each rate element.</P>
              <P>(iii) Calculate the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction. The Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction is equal to one-half of the difference between the amount calculated in (b)(2)(i) of this section and the amount calculated in (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) A Rate-of-Return Carrier may elect to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service using its intrastate access rate structure. Carriers using this option shall establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service such that Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenue at the proposed rates is no greater than Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenue at the intrastate rates in effect as of December 29, 2011 less the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand. Carriers electing to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service in this manner shall notify the appropriate state regulatory authority of their election in the filing required by § 51.907(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(v) A Rate-of-Return Carrier may elect to apply its interstate access rate structure and interstate rates to Transitional Intrastate Access Service. In addition to applicable interstate access rates, the carrier may, between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013, assess a transitional per-minute charge on Transitional Intrastate Access Service end office switching minutes (previously billed as intrastate access). The transitional per-minute charge shall be no greater than the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction divided by Fiscal Year 2011 Transitional Intrastate Access Service end office switching minutes. Carriers electing to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service in this manner shall notify the appropriate state regulatory authority of their election in the filing required by § 51.907(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, nothing in this section obligates or allows a Rate-of-Return carrier that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions raising such rates.</P>
              <P>(4) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier must make an intrastate switched access rate reduction pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and that Rate-of-Return Carrier has an intrastate rate for a rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element, the Rate-of-Return Carrier shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Increase the rate for any intrastate rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element to the interstate rate no later than July 1, 2013;</P>
              <P>(ii) Include any increases made pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section in the calculation of its eligible recovery for 2012.</P>

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, nothing in this section obligates or allows a Rate-of-Return Carrier that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions to increase such rates.</P>
              <P>(2) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier made an intrastate switched access rate reduction in 2012 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and that Rate-of-Return Carrier has an intrastate rate for a rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element, the Rate-of-Return Carrier shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Increase any intrastate rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate to the interstate rate by July 1, 2013; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Include any increases made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section in the calculation of its eligible recovery for 2013.</P>

For fixed charges, the Rate-of-Return Carrier shall divide the amount based on relative originating and terminating end office switching minutes. If sufficient originating and terminating end office switching minute data is not available, the carrier shall divide such charges equally between originating and terminating elements.</P>
              <P>(2) Nothing in this Step shall affect Tandem-Switched Transport Access Service or Dedicated Transport Access Service.</P>
              <P>(3) Each Rate-of-Return Carrier shall establish rates for interstate and intrastate terminating End Office Access Service using the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) Each Rate-of-Return Carrier shall calculate the 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. The 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate means the Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate calculated using Fiscal Year 2011 interstate demand and the interstate End Office Access Service rates at the levels in effect on December 29, 2011.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each Rate-of-Return Carrier shall calculate its 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. The 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate means $0.005 per minute plus two-thirds of any difference between the 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate and $0.005 per minute.</P>
              <P>(iii) Beginning July 1, 2014, no Rate-of-Return Carrier's interstate Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate shall exceed its 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate. A rate-of-return carrier shall determine compliance by calculating interstate Composite Terminating End Office Access Rates using the relevant projected interstate demand for the tariff period multiplied by the respective interstate rates as of July 1, 2014, and then dividing by the projected interstate terminating end office local switching demand for the tariff period. A rate-of-return carrier's intrastate terminating end office access rates may not exceed the comparable interstate terminating end office access rates. In the alternative, any Rate-of-Return Carrier may elect to implement a single per minute rate element for both interstate and intrastate terminating End Office Access Service no greater than the 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate if its intrastate terminating end office access rates would be at rate parity with its interstate terminating end office access rates.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Caps on Access Reciprocal Compensation and switched access rates.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules:</P>

              <P>(1) In the case of Competitive LECs operating in an area served by a Price Cap Carrier, no such Competitive LEC <PRTPAGE P="71"/>may increase the rate for any originating or terminating intrastate switched access service above the rate for such service in effect on December 29, 2011.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of Competitive LEC operating in an area served by an incumbent local exchange carrier that is a Rate-of-Return Carrier or Competitive LECs that are subject to the rural exemption in § 61.26(e) of this chapter, no such Competitive LEC may increase the rate for any originating or terminating intrastate switched access service above the rate for such service in effect on December 29, 2011, with the exception of intrastate originating access service. For such Competitive LECs, intrastate originating access service subject to this subpart shall remain subject to the same state rate regulation in effect December 31, 2011, as may be modified by the state thereafter.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, beginning July 3, 2012, notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, each Competitive LEC that has tariffs on file with state regulatory authorities shall file intrastate access tariff provisions, in accordance with § 51.505(b)(2), that set forth the rates applicable to Transitional Intrastate Access Service in each state in which it provides Transitional Intrastate Access Service. Each Competitive Local Exchange Carrier shall establish the rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service using the following methodology.</P>
              <P>(1) Calculate total revenue from Transitional Intrastate Access Service at the carrier's interstate access rates in effect on December 29, 2011, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand for each rate element.</P>
              <P>(2) Calculate total revenue from Transitional Intrastate Access Service at the carrier's intrastate access rates in effect on December 29, 2011, using Fiscal Year 2011 intrastate switched access demand for each rate element.</P>
              <P>(3) Calculate the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction. The Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction is equal to one-half of the difference between the amount calculated in (b)(1) of this section and the amount calculated in (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) A Competitive Local Exchange Carrier may elect to establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service using its intrastate access rate structure. Carriers using this option shall establish rates for Transitional Intrastate Access Service such that Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenue at the proposed rates is no greater than Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenue at the intrastate rates in effect as of December 29, 2011 less the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction, using Fiscal year 2011 intrastate switched access demand.</P>
              <P>(5) In the alternative, a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier may elect to apply its interstate access rate structure and interstate rates to Transitional Intrastate Access Service. In addition to applicable interstate access rates, the carrier may assess a transitional per-minute charge on Transitional Intrastate Access Service end office switching minutes (previously billed as intrastate access). The transitional charge shall be no greater than the Step 1 Access Revenue Reduction divided by Fiscal year 2011 intrastate switched access demand</P>
              <P>(6) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, nothing in this section obligates or allows a Competitive LEC that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions raising such rates.</P>
              <P>(7) If a Competitive LEC must make an intrastate switched access rate reduction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and that Competitive LEC has an intrastate rate for a rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element, the Competitive LEC may increase the rate for any intrastate rate element that is below the comparable interstate rate for that element to the interstate rate no later than July 1, 2013;</P>

              <P>(c) Beginning July 1, 2013, notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, all Competitive Local Exchange Carrier Access Reciprocal Compensation rates for switched exchange access services subject to this subpart shall be no higher than the Access Reciprocal Compensation rates charged by the competing incumbent <PRTPAGE P="72"/>local exchange carrier, in accordance with the same procedures specified in § 61.26 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) Until June 30, 2014, intrastate originating Access Reciprocal Compensation subject to this subpart exchanged between a local exchange carrier and another telecommunications carrier in Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) format that originates and/or terminates in IP format shall be subject to a rate equal to the relevant intrastate originating access charges specified by this subpart. Effective July 1, 2014, originating Access Reciprocal Compensation subject to this subpart exchanged between a local exchange carrier and another telecommunications carrier in Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) format that originates and/or terminates in IP format shall be subject to a rate equal to the relevant interstate originating access charges specified by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) Telecommunications traffic originates and/or terminates in IP format if it originates from and/or terminates to an end-user customer of a service that requires Internet protocol-compatible customer premises equipment.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, a local exchange carrier shall be entitled to assess and collect the full Access Reciprocal Compensation charges prescribed by this subpart that are set forth in a local exchange carrier's interstate or intrastate tariff for the access services defined in § 51.903 regardless of whether the local exchange carrier itself delivers such traffic to the called party's premises or delivers the call to the called party's premises via contractual or other arrangements with an affiliated or unaffiliated provider of interconnected VoIP service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(25), or a non-interconnected VoIP service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(36), that does not itself seek to collect Access Reciprocal Compensation charges prescribed by this subpart for that traffic. This rule does not permit a local exchange carrier to charge for functions not performed by the local exchange carrier itself or the affiliated or unaffiliated provider of interconnected VoIP service or non-interconnected VoIP service. For purposes of this provision, functions provided by a LEC as part of transmitting telecommunications between designated points using, in whole or in part, technology other than TDM transmission in a manner that is comparable to a service offered by a local exchange carrier constitutes the functional equivalent of the incumbent local exchange carrier access service.</P>

              <P>(iii) Beginning July 1, 2014, a Rate-of-Return Carrier's eligible recovery will be equal to the 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue multiplied by the Rate-of-Return Carrier Baseline Adjustment Factor less:</P>
              <P>(A) The Expected Revenues from Transitional Intrastate Access Service for the year beginning July 1, 2014, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in § 51.909 (including the reduction in intrastate End Office Switched Access Service rates), adjusted to reflect the True-Up Adjustment for Transitional Intrastate Access Service for the year beginning July 1, 2012;</P>
              <P>(B) The Expected Revenues from interstate switched access for the year beginning July 1, 2014, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in § 51.909, adjusted to reflect the True-Up Adjustment for Interstate Switched Access for the year beginning July 1, 2012; and</P>
              <P>(C) Expected Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues for the year beginning July 1, 2014 using the target methodology required by § 51.705, adjusted to reflect the True-Up Adjustment for Reciprocal Compensation for the year beginning July 1, 2012.</P>
              <P>(D) An amount equal to True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charges for the year beginning July 1, 2012 multiplied by negative one.</P>
              <P>(iv) Beginning July 1, 2015, and for all subsequent years, a Rate-of-Return Carrier's eligible recovery will be calculated by updating the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section for the period beginning July 1, 2014, to reflect the passage of an additional year in each subsequent year.</P>
              <P>(v) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier receives payments for intrastate or interstate switched access services or for Access Recovery Charges after the period used to measure the adjustments to reflect the differences between estimated and actual revenues, it shall treat such payments as actual revenue in the year the payment is received and shall reflect this as an additional adjustment for that year.</P>
              <P>(vi) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier receives or makes reciprocal compensation payments after the period used to measure the adjustments to reflect the differences between estimated and actual net reciprocal compensation revenues, it shall treat such amounts as actual revenues or payments in the year the payment is received or made and shall reflect this as an additional adjustment for that year.</P>
              <P>(vii) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier recovers any costs or revenues that are already being recovered as Eligible Recovery through Access Recovery Charges or the Connect America Fund from another source, that carrier's ability to recover reduced switched access revenue from Access Recovery Charges or the Connect America Fund shall be reduced to the extent it receives duplicative recovery. Any duplicative recovery shall be reflected as a reduction to a carrier's Eligible Recovery calculated pursuant to § 51.917(d). A Rate-of-Return Carrier seeking revenue recovery must annually certify as part of its tariff filings to the Commission and to the relevant state commission that the carrier is not seeking duplicative recovery in the state jurisdiction for any Eligible Recovery subject to the recovery mechanism.</P>
              <P>(viii)(A) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier in any tariff period underestimates its projected demand for services covered by § 51.917(b)(6) or 51.915(b)(13), and thus has too much Eligible Recovery in that tariff period, it shall refund the amount of any such True-up Revenues or True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charge that are not offset by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's Eligible Recovery (calculated before including the true-up amounts in the Eligible Recovery calculation) in the true-up tariff period to the Administrator by August 1 following the date of the Rate-of-Return Carrier's annual access tariff filing.</P>

              <P>(B) If a Rate-of-Return Carrier in any tariff period receives too little Eligible Recovery because it overestimates its projected demand for services covered by § 51.917(b)(6) or 51.915(b)(13), which <PRTPAGE P="84"/>True-up Revenues and True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charge it cannot recover in the true-up tariff period because the Rate-of-Return Carrier has a negative Eligible Recovery in the true-up tariff period (before calculating the true-up amount in the Eligible Recovery calculation), the Rate-of-Return Carrier shall treat the unrecoverable true-up amount as its Eligible Recovery for the true-up tariff period.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Access Recovery Charge.</E> (1) A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents per line per month may be assessed upon end users that may be assessed a subscriber line charge pursuant to § 69.104 of this chapter, to the extent necessary to allow the Rate-of-Return Carrier to recover some or all of its Eligible Recovery determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, subject to the caps described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. A Rate-of-Return Carrier may elect to forgo charging some or all of the Access Recovery Charge.</P>
              <P>(2) Total Access Recovery Charges calculated by multiplying the tariffed Access Recovery Charge by the projected demand for the year may not recover more than the amount of eligible recovery calculated pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section for the year beginning on July 1.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purposes of this section, a Rate-of-Return Carrier holding company includes all of its wholly-owned operating companies. A Rate-of-Return Carrier Holding Company may recover the eligible recovery attributable to any Rate-of-Return study areas operated by its wholly-owned operating companies that are Rate-of-Return incumbent local exchange carriers through assessments of the Access Recovery Charge on end users in any Rate-of-Return study areas operated by its wholly-owned operating companies that are Rate-of-Return incumbent local exchange carriers.</P>
              <P>(4) Distribution of Access Recovery Charges among lines of different types</P>
              <P>(i) A Rate-of-Return Carrier that does not receive ICC-replacement CAF support (whether because they elect not to or because they do not have sufficient eligible recovery after the Access Recovery Charge is assessed or imputed) may not recover a higher ratio of its total revenue recovery from Access Recovery Charges assessed on Residential and Single Line Business lines than the following ratio (using holding company lines):</P>
              <P>(A) The number of Residential and Single-Line Business lines assessed an End User Common Line charge (excluding Lifeline Customers), divided by</P>
              <P>(B) The sum of the number of Residential and Single-Line Business lines assessed an End User Common Line charge (excluding Lifeline Customers), and two (2) times the number of End User Common Line charges assessed on Multi-Line Business customers.</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of this subpart, Residential and Single Line Business lines are lines (other than lines of Lifeline Customers) assessed the residential and single line business end user common line charge.</P>
              <P>(i) For purposes of this subpart, Multi-Line Business Lines are lines assessed the multi-line business end user common line charge.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Per-line caps and other limitations on Access Recovery Charges.</E> (i) For each line other than lines of Lifeline Customers assessed a primary residential or single-line business end user common line charge pursuant to § 69.104 of this chapter, a Rate-of-Return Carrier may assess an Access Recovery Charge as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Beginning July 1, 2012, a maximum of $0.50 per month for each line;</P>
              <P>(B) Beginning July 1, 2013, a maximum of $1.00 per month for each line;</P>
              <P>(C) Beginning July 1, 2014, a maximum of $1.50 per month for each line;</P>
              <P>(D) Beginning July 1, 2015, a maximum of $2.00 per month for each line;</P>

              <P>(F) Beginning July 1, 2017, a maximum of $3.00 per month for each line.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each line assessed a multi-line business end user common line charge pursuant to § 69.104 of this chapter, a Rate-of-Return Carrier may assess an Access Recovery Charge as follows:</P>

              <P>(A) Beginning July 1, 2012, a maximum of $1.00 per month for each <PRTPAGE P="85"/>multi-line business end user common line charge assessed;</P>
              <P>(B) Beginning July 1, 2013, a maximum of $2.00 per month for each multi-line business end user common line charge assessed;</P>

              <P>(E) Beginning July 1, 2016, a maximum of $5.00 per month for each multi-line business end user common line charge assessed; and</P>
              <P>(F) Beginning July 1, 2017, a maximum of $6.00 per month for each multi-line business end user common line charge assessed.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Access Recovery Charge allowed by paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section may not be assessed to the extent that its assessment would bring the total of the Rate Ceiling Component Charges above the Residential Rate Ceiling. This limitation does not apply to single-line business customers.</P>
              <P>(iv) The Access Recovery Charge allowed by paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section may not be assessed to the extent that its assessment would bring the total of the multi-line business end user common line charge and the Access Recovery Charge above $12.20 per line.</P>
              <P>(v) The Access Recovery Charge may not be assessed on lines of Lifeline Customers.</P>
              <P>(vi) If in any year, the Rate of return carriers' Access Recovery Charge is not at its maximum, the succeeding year's Access Recovery Charge may not increase more than $0.50 per line for charges under paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section or $1.00 per line for charges assessed under paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) A Price Cap Carrier with study areas that are subject to rate-of-return regulation shall recover its eligible recovery for such study areas through the recovery procedures specified in this section. For that purpose, the provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall apply to the rate-of-return study areas if the applicable conditions in paragraph (e)(3) of this section are met.</P>

Once it makes the election not to receive CAF ICC Support, it may not elect to receive such funding at a later date.</P>
              <P>(2) Beginning July 1, 2012, a Rate-of-Return Carrier may recover any eligible recovery allowed by paragraph (d) of this section that it could not have recovered through charges assessed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section from CAF ICC Support pursuant to § 54.304. For this purpose, the Rate-of-Return Carrier must impute the maximum charges it could have assessed under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>North American Numbering Plan Administrator and B&amp;C Agent.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The North American Numbering Plan Administrator (“NANPA”) and the associated “B&amp;C Agent” will conduct their respective operations in accordance with this section. The NANPA and the B&amp;C Agent will conduct their respective operations with oversight from the Federal Communications Commission (the “Commission”) and with recommendations from the North American Numbering Council (“NANC”).</P>
              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Neutrality.</E> The NANPA and the B&amp;C Agent shall be non-governmental entities that are impartial and not aligned with any particular telecommunication industry segment. Accordingly, while conducting their respective operations under this section, the NANPA and B&amp;C Agent shall ensure that they comply with the following neutrality criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The NANPA and B&amp;C Agent may not be an affiliate of any telecommunications service provider(s) as defined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, or an affiliate of any interconnected VoIP provider as that term is defined in § 52.21(h). “Affiliate” is a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under the direct or indirect common control with another person. A person shall be deemed to control another if such person possesses, directly or indirectly—</P>
              <P>(A) An equity interest by stock, partnership (general or limited) interest, joint venture participation, or member interest in the other person ten (10%) percent or more of the total outstanding equity interests in the other person, or</P>

              <P>(B) The power to vote ten (10%) percent or more of the securities (by stock, partnership (general or limited) interest, joint venture participation, or member interest) having ordinary voting power for the election of directors, <PRTPAGE P="90"/>general partner, or management of such other person, or</P>
              <P>(C) The power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such other person, whether through the ownership of or right to vote voting rights attributable to the stock, partnership (general or limited) interest, joint venture participation, or member interest) of such other person, by contract (including but not limited to stockholder agreement, partnership (general or limited) agreement, joint venture agreement, or operating agreement), or otherwise;</P>
              <P>(ii) The NANPA and B&amp;C Agent, and any affiliate thereof, may not issue a majority of its debt to, nor may it derive a majority of its revenues from, any telecommunications service provider. “Majority” shall mean greater than 50 percent, and “debt” shall mean stocks, bonds, securities, notes, loans or any other instrument of indebtedness; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Notwithstanding the neutrality criteria set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the NANPA and B&amp;C Agent may be determined to be or not to be subject to undue influence by parties with a vested interest in the outcome of numbering administration and activities. NANC may conduct an evaluation to determine whether the NANPA and B&amp;C Agent meet the undue influence criterion.</P>
              <P>(2) Any subcontractor that performs—</P>
              <P>(i) NANP administration and central office code administration, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Billing and Collection functions, for the NANPA or for the B&amp;C Agent must also meet the neutrality criteria described in paragraph (a)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Term of administration.</E> The NANPA shall provide numbering administration, including central office code administration, for the United States portion of the North American Numbering Plan (“NANP”) for an initial period of five (5) years. At any time prior to the termination of the initial or subsequent term of administration, such term may be renewed for up to five (5) years with the approval of the Commission and the agreement of the NANPA. The B&amp;C Agent shall provide billing and collection functions for an initial period of five (5) years. At any time prior to the termination of the initial or subsequent term of administration, such term may be renewed for up to five (5) years with the approval of the Commission and the agreement of the B&amp;C Agent.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Changes to regulations, rules, guidelines or directives.</E> In the event that regulatory authorities or industry groups (including, for example, the Industry Numbering Committee—INC, or its successor) issue rules, requirements, guidelines or policy directives which may affect the functions performed by the NANPA and the B&amp;C Agent, the NANPA and the B&amp;C Agent shall, within 10 business days from the date of official notice of such rules, requirements, guidelines or policy directives, assess the impact on its operations and advise the Commission of any changes required. NANPA and the B&amp;C Agent shall provide written explanation why such changes are required. To the extent the Commission deems such changes are necessary, the Commission will recommend to the NANP member countries appropriate cost recovery adjustments, if necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Performance review process.</E> NANPA and the B&amp;C Agent shall develop and implement an internal, documented performance monitoring mechanism and shall provide such performance review on request of the Commission on at least an annual basis. The annual assessment process will not preclude telecommunications industry participants from identifying performance problems to the NANPA, the B&amp;C Agent and the NANC as they occur, and from seeking expeditious resolution. If performance problems are identified by a telecommunications industry participant, the NANC, B&amp;C Agent or NANPA shall investigate and report within 10 business days of notice to the participant of corrective action, if any, taken or to be taken. The NANPA, B&amp;C Agent or NANC (as appropriate) shall be permitted reasonable time to take corrective action, including the necessity of obtaining the required consent of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination.</E> If the Commission determines at any time that the NANPA or the B&amp;C Agent fails to comply with the neutrality criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section or <PRTPAGE P="91"/>substantially or materially defaults in the performance of its obligations, the Commission shall advise immediately the NANPA or the B&amp;C Agent of said failure or default, request immediate corrective action, and permit the NANPA or B&amp;C Agent reasonable time to correct such failure or default. If the NANPA or B&amp;C Agent is unwilling or unable to take corrective action, the Commission may, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, take any action that it deems appropriate, including termination of the NANPA's or B&amp;C Agent's term of administration.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Required and optional enterprise services.</E> Enterprise Services, which are services beyond those described in § 52.13 that may be provided by the new NANPA for specified fees, may be offered with prior approval of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Required Enterprise Services.</E> At the request of a code holder, the NANPA shall, in accordance with industry standards and for reasonable fees, enter certain routing and rating information, into the industry-approved database(s) for dissemination of such information. This task shall include reviewing the information and assisting in its preparation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Optional Enterprise Services.</E> The NANPA may, subject to prior approval and for reasonable fees, offer “Optional Enterprise Services” which are any services not described elsewhere in this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Annual report.</E> NANPA shall identify and record all direct costs associated with providing Enterprise Services separately from the costs associated with the non-enterprise NANPA functions. The NANPA shall submit an annual report to the NANC summarizing the revenues and costs for providing each Enterprise Service. NANPA shall be audited by an independent auditor after the first year of operations and every two years thereafter, and submit the report to the Commission for appropriate review and action.</P>

              <P>(b) State commissions may perform any or all functions related to initiation and development of area code relief plans, so long as they act consistently with the guidelines enumerated in this part, and subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For the purposes of this paragraph, initiation and development of area code relief planning encompasses all functions related to the implementation of new area codes that were performed by central office code administrators prior to February 8, 1996. Such functions may include: declaring that the area code relief planning process should begin; convening and conducting meetings to which the telecommunications industry and the public are invited on area code relief for a particular area code; and developing the details of a proposed area code relief plan or plans.</P>
              <P>(1) The entity or entities designated by the Commission to serve as central office code administrator(s) shall initiate and develop area code relief plans for each area code in each state that has not notified such entity or entities, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that the state will handle such functions.</P>
              <P>(2) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a state commission must notify the entity or entities designated by the Commission to serve as central office code administrator(s) for its state that such state commission intends to perform matters related to initiation and development of area code relief planning efforts in its state. Notification shall be written and shall include a description of the specific functions the state commission intends to perform. Where the NANP Administrator serves as the central office code administrator, such notification must be made within 120 days of the selection of the NANP Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) New area codes may be introduced through the use of:</P>
              <P>(1) A geographic area code split, which occurs when the geographic area served by an area code in which there are few or no central office codes left for assignment is split into two or more geographic parts;</P>
              <P>(2) An area code boundary realignment, which occurs when the boundary lines between two adjacent area codes are shifted to allow the transfer of some central office codes from an area code for which central office codes remain unassigned to an area code for which few or no central office codes are left for assignment; or</P>
              <P>(3) An all services area code overlay, which occurs when a new area code is introduced to serve the same geographic area as one or more existing area code(s), subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) No all services area code overlay may be implemented unless all numbering resources in the new overlay area code are assigned to those entities requesting assignment on a first-come, first-serve basis, regardless of the identity of, technology used by, or type of service provided by that entity, except to the extent that a technology- or service-specific overlay is authorized by the Commission. No group of telecommunications carriers shall be excluded from assignment of numbering resources in the existing area code, or be assigned such resources only from the all services overlay area code, based solely on that group's provision of a specific type of telecommunications service or use of a particular technology; and</P>
              <P>(ii) No area code overlay may be implemented unless there exists, at the time of implementation, mandatory ten-digit dialing for every telephone call within and between all area codes in the geographic area covered by the overlay area code.</P>

              <P>(4) A technology-specific or service-specific overlay, which occurs when a new area code is introduced to serve the same geographic area as one or more existing area code(s) and numbering resources in the new area code <PRTPAGE P="101"/>overlay are assigned to a specific technology(ies) or service(s). State commissions may not implement a technology-specific or service-specific overlay without express authority from the Commission.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all local exchange carriers (LECs) must provide number portability in compliance with the following performance criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) Supports network services, features, and capabilities existing at the time number portability is implemented, including but not limited to emergency services, CLASS features, operator and directory assistance services, and intercept capabilities;</P>
              <P>(2) Efficiently uses numbering resources;</P>
              <P>(3) Does not require end users to change their telecommunications numbers;</P>
              <P>(4) Does not result in unreasonable degradation in service quality or network reliability when implemented;</P>
              <P>(5) Does not result in any degradation in service quality or network reliability when customers switch carriers;</P>
              <P>(6) Does not result in a carrier having a proprietary interest;</P>
              <P>(7) Is able to migrate to location and service portability; and</P>
              <P>(8) Has no significant adverse impact outside the areas where number portability is deployed.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) All LECs must provide a long-term database method for number portability in the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), as defined in § 52.21(k), in switches for which another carrier has made a specific request for the provision of number portability, subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Any procedure to identify and request switches for deployment of number portability must comply with the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Any wireline carrier that is certified (or has applied for certification) to provide local exchange service in a state, or any licensed CMRS provider, must be permitted to make a request for deployment of number portability in that state;</P>

              <P>(iii) A LEC must make available upon request to any interested parties a list of its switches for which number portability has been requested and a list of its switches for which number portability has not been requested; and</P>
              <P>(iv) After the deadline for deployment of number portability in an MSA in the 100 largest MSAs, according to the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part, a LEC must deploy number portability in that MSA in additional switches upon request within the following time frames:</P>
              <P>(A) For remote switches supported by a host switch equipped for portability (“Equipped Remote Switches”), within 30 days;</P>
              <P>(B) For switches that require software but not hardware changes to provide portability (“Hardware Capable Switches”), within 60 days;</P>
              <P>(C) For switches that require hardware changes to provide portability (“Capable Switches Requiring Hardware”), within 180 days; and</P>
              <P>(D) For switches not capable of portability that must be replaced (“Non-Capable Switches”), within 180 days.</P>
              <P>(c) Beginning January 1, 1999, all LECs must make a long-term database method for number portability available within six months after a specific request by another telecommunications carrier in areas in which that telecommunications carrier is operating or plans to operate.</P>

              <P>(d) The Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, may waive or stay any of the dates in the implementation schedule, as the Chief determines is necessary to ensure the efficient development of number portability, for a period not to exceed 9 months (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, no later than September 30, 1999).</P>

              <P>(e) In the event a LEC is unable to meet the Commission's deadlines for implementing a long-term database method for number portability, it may file with the Commission at least 60 days in advance of the deadline a petition to extend the time by which implementation in its network will be completed. A LEC seeking such relief must demonstrate through substantial, credible evidence the basis for its contention that it is unable to comply with the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part 52. Such requests must set forth:<PRTPAGE P="104"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The facts that demonstrate why the carrier is unable to meet the Commission's deployment schedule;</P>
              <P>(2) A detailed explanation of the activities that the carrier has undertaken to meet the implementation schedule prior to requesting an extension of time;</P>
              <P>(3) An identification of the particular switches for which the extension is requested;</P>
              <P>(4) The time within which the carrier will complete deployment in the affected switches; and</P>
              <P>(5) A proposed schedule with milestones for meeting the deployment date.</P>
              <P>(f) The Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, shall monitor the progress of local exchange carriers implementing number portability, and may direct such carriers to take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part 52.</P>
              <P>(g) Carriers that are members of the Illinois Local Number Portability Workshop must conduct a field test of any technically feasible long-term database method for number portability in the Chicago, Illinois, area. The carriers participating in the test must jointly file with the Common Carrier Bureau a report of their findings within 30 days following completion of the test. The Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, shall monitor developments during the field test, and may adjust the field test completion deadline as necessary.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Porting from a wireline carrier to a wireless carrier is required where the requesting wireless carrier's “coverage area,” as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, overlaps the geographic location in which the customer's wireline number is provisioned, provided that the porting-in carrier maintains the number's original rate center designation following the port.</P>
              <P>(2) The wireless “coverage area” is defined as the area in which wireless service can be received from the wireless carrier.</P>

              <P>(g) Any state may opt out of its designated regional database and implement a state-specific database. A state must notify the Wireline Competition Bureau and NANC that it plans to implement a state-specific database within 60 days from the release date of the Public Notice issued by the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, identifying the administrator selected by the NANC and the proposed locations of the regional databases. Carriers may challenge a state's decision to opt out of the regional database system by filing a petition with the Commission.<PRTPAGE P="105"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) Individual state databases must meet the national requirements and operational standards recommended by the NANC and adopted by the Commission. In addition, such state databases must be technically compatible with the regional system of databases and must not interfere with the scheduled implementation of the regional databases.</P>
              <P>(i) Individual carriers may download information necessary to provide number portability from the regional databases into their own downstream databases. Individual carriers may mix information needed to provide other services or functions with the information downloaded from the regional databases at their own downstream databases. Carriers may not withhold any information necessary to provide number portability from the regional databases on the grounds that such data has been combined with other information in its downstream database.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements set forth in the <E T="03">Working Group Report</E>, the following requirements are established:</P>
              <P>(1) Each designated N-1 carrier (as described in the <E T="03">Working Group Report</E>) is responsible for ensuring number portability queries are performed on a N-1 basis where “N” is the entity terminating the call to the end user, or a network provider contracted by the entity to provide tandem access, unless another carrier has already performed the query;</P>
              <P>(2) If a telecommunictions carrier transmits a telephone call to a local exchange carrier's switch that contains any ported numbers, and the telecommunications carrier has failed to perform a database query to determine if the telephone number has been ported to another local exchange carrier, the local exchange carrier may block the unqueried call only if performing the database query is likely to impair network reliability;</P>
              <P>(3) The regional limited liability companies (LLCs), already established by telecommunications carriers in each of the original Bell Operating Company regions, shall manage and oversee the local number portability administrators, subject to review by the NANC, but only on an interim basis, until the conclusion of a rulemaking to examine the issue of local number portability administrator oversight and management and the question of whether the LLCs should continue to act in this capacity; and</P>

              <P>(4) The NANC shall provide ongoing oversight of number portability administration, including oversight of the regional LLCs, subject to Commission review. Parties shall attempt to resolve issues regarding number portability deployment among themselves and, if necessary, under the auspices of the NANC. If any party objects to the NANC's proposed resolution, the NANC shall issue a written report summarizing the positions of the parties and the basis for the recommendation adopted by the NANC. The NANC Chair shall submit its proposed resolution of the dispuited issue to the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau as a recommendation for Commission review. The Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau will place the NANC's proposed resolution on public notice. Recommendations adopted by the NANC and forwarded to the Bureau may be implemented by the parties pending review of the recommendation. Within 90 days of the conclusion of the comment cycle, the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau may issue an order adopting, modifying, or rejecting the <PRTPAGE P="106"/>recommendation.

              <SUBJECT>Deployment of long-term database methods for number portability by CMRS providers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) By November 24, 2003, all covered CMRS providers must provide a long-term database method for number portability, including the ability to support roaming, in the 100 largest MSAs, as defined in § 52.21(k), in compliance with the performance criteria set forth in section 52.23(a) of this part, in switches for which another carrier has made a specific request for the provision of number portability, subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A licensee may have more than one CMRS system, but only the systems that satisfy the definition of covered CMRS are required to provide number portability.</P>
              <P>(1) Any procedure to identify and request switches for development of number portability must comply with the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Any wireline carrier that is certified (or has applied for certification) to provide local exchange service in a state, or any licensed CMRS provider, must be permitted to make a request for deployment of number portability in that state;</P>
              <P>(ii) Carries requesting deployment in the 100 largest MSAs by November 24, 2003 must submit requests by February 24, 2003.</P>
              <P>(iii) A covered CMRS provider must make available upon request to any interested parties a list of its switches for which number portability has been requested and a list of its switches for which number portability has not been requested;</P>
              <P>(iv) After November 24, 2003, a covered CMRS provider must deploy number portability in additional switches serving the 100 largest MSAs upon request within the following time frames:</P>
              <P>(A) For remote switches supported by a host switch equipped for portability (“Equipped Remote Switches”), within 30 days;</P>
              <P>(B) For switches that require software but not hardware changes to provide portability (“Hardware Capable Switches”), within 60 days;</P>
              <P>(C) For switches that require hardware changes to provide portability (“Capable Switches Requiring Hardware”), within 180 days; and</P>
              <P>(D) For switches not capable of portability that must be replaced (“Non-Capable Switches”), within 180 days.</P>
              <P>(v) Carriers must be able to request deployment in any wireless switch that serves any area within the MSA, even if the wireless switch is outside that MSA, or outside any of the MSAs identified in the Appendix to this part.</P>
              <P>(2) By November 24, 2002, all covered CMRS providers must be able to support roaming nationwide.</P>
              <P>(b) By December 31, 1998, all covered CMRS providers must have the capability to obtain routing information, either by querying the appropriate database themselves or by making arrangements with other carriers that are capable of performing database queries, so that they can deliver calls from their networks to any party that has retained its number after switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.</P>
              <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(d) In the event a carrier subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is unable to meet the Commission's deadlines for implementing a long-term <PRTPAGE P="107"/>number portability method, it may file with the Commission at least 60 days in advance of the deadline a petition to extend the time by which implementation in its network will be completed. A carrier seeking such relief must demonstrate through substantial, credible evidence the basis for its contention that it is unable to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Such requests must set forth:</P>
              <P>(1) The facts that demonstrate why the carrier is unable to meet our deployment schedule;</P>
              <P>(2) A detailed explanation of the activities that the carrier has undertaken to meet the implementation schedule prior to requesting an extension of time;</P>
              <P>(3) An identification of the particular switches for which the extension is requested;</P>
              <P>(4) The time within which the carrier will complete deployment in the affected switches; and</P>
              <P>(5) A proposed schedule with milestones for meeting the deployment date.</P>
              <P>(e) The Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, may establish reporting requirements in order to monitor the progress of covered CMRS providers implementing number portability, and may direct such carriers to take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with this deployment schedule.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Allocation of the shared costs of long-term number portability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The local number portability administrator, as defined in § 52.21(h), of each regional database, as defined in § 52.21(1), shall recover the shared costs of long-term number portability attributable to that regional database from all telecommunications carriers providing telecommunications service in areas that regional database serves. Pursuant to its duties under § 52.26, the local number portability administrator shall collect sufficient revenues to fund the operation of the regional database by:</P>
              <P>(1) Assessing a $100 yearly contribution on each telecommunications carrier identified in paragraph (a) introductory text that has no intrastate, interstate, or international end-user telecommunications revenue derived from providing telecommunications service in the areas that regional database serves, and</P>
              <P>(2) Assessing on each of the other telecommunications carriers providing telecommunications service in areas that regional database serves, a charge that recovers the remaining shared costs of long-term number portability attributable to that regional database in proportion to the ratio of:</P>
              <P>(i) The sum of the intrastate, interstate, and international end-user telecommunications revenues that such telecommunications carrier derives from providing telecommunications service in the areas that regional database serves, ii) to the sum of the intrastate, interstate, and international end-user telecommunications revenues that all telecommunications carriers derive from providing telecommunications service in the areas that regional database serves.</P>

              <P>(b) All telecommunications carriers providing service in the United States shall complete and submit a “Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet” (as published by the Commission in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>), which sets forth the information needed to calculate contributions referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The worksheet shall be certified to by an officer of the contributor, and subject to verification by the Commission or the administrator at the discretion of the Commission. The Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or eliminate contributor reporting requirements that prove unnecessary and require additional reporting requirements that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound and efficient administration of long-term number portability.</P>

              <P>(c) Local number portability administrators shall keep all data obtained from contributors confidential and shall not disclose such data in company-specific form unless directed to do so by the Commission. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Chief <PRTPAGE P="108"/>of the Wireline Competition Bureau, the local number portability administrators may share data obtained from carriers with the administrators of the universal service support mechanism (See 47 CFR 54.701 of this chapter), the TRS Fund (See 47 CFR 64.604(c)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter), and the North American Numbering Plan cost recovery (See 47 CFR 52.16). The local number portability administrators shall keep confidential all data obtained from other administrators. The administrators shall use such data, from carriers or administrators, only for purposes of administering local number portability. The Commission shall have access to all data reported to the Administrator. Contributors may make requests for Commission nondisclosure of company-specific revenue information under § 0.459 of this chapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data are submitted. The Commission shall make all decisions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific information.</P>
              <P>(d) Once a telecommunications carrier has been allocated, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, its portion of the shared costs of long-term number portability attributable to a regional database, the carrier shall treat that portion as a carrier-specific cost directly related to providing number portability.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recovery of carrier-specific costs directly related to providing long-term number portability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Incumbent local exchange carriers may recover their carrier-specific costs directly related to providing long-term number portability by establishing in tariffs filed with the Federal Communications Commission a monthly number-portability charge, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a number portability query-service charge, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and a monthly number-portability query/administration charge, as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The monthly number-portability charge may take effect no earlier than February 1, 1999, on a date the incumbent local exchange carrier selects, and may end no later than 5 five years after the incumbent local exchange carrier's monthly number-portability charge takes effect.</P>
              <P>(i) An incumbent local exchange carrier may assess each end user it serves in the 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas, and each end user it serves from a number-portability-capable switch outside the 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas, one monthly number-portability charge per line except that:</P>
              <P>(A) One PBX trunk shall receive nine monthly number-portability charges.</P>
              <P>(B) One PRI ISDN line shall receive five monthly number-portability charges.</P>
              <P>(C) Lifeline Assistance Program customers shall not receive the monthly number-portability charge.</P>
              <P>(ii) An incumbent local exchange carrier may assess on carriers that purchase the incumbent local exchange carrier's switching ports as unbundled network elements under section 251 of the Communications Act, and/or Feature Group A access lines, and resellers of the incumbent local exchange carrier's local service, the same charges as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, as if the incumbent local exchange carrier were serving those carriers' end users.</P>
              <P>(iii) An incumbent local exchange carrier may not assess a monthly number-portability charge for local loops carriers purchase as unbundled network elements under section 251.</P>
              <P>(iv) The incumbent local exchange carrier shall levelize the monthly number-portability charge over five years by setting a rate for the charge at which the present value of the revenue recovered by the charge does not exceed the present value of the cost being recovered, using a discount rate equal to the rate of return on investment which the Commission has prescribed for interstate access services pursuant to Part 65 of the Commission's Rules.</P>

              <P>(2) The number portability query-service charge may recover only carrier-specific costs directly related to <PRTPAGE P="109"/>providing long-term number portability that the incumbent local exchange carrier incurs to provide long-term number portability query service to carriers on a prearranged and default basis.</P>
              <P>(3) An incumbent local exchange carrier serving an area outside the 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas that is not number-portability capable but that participates in an extended area service calling plan with any one of the 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas or with an adjacent number portability-capable local exchange carrier may assess each end user it serves one monthly number-portability query/administration charge per line to recover the costs of queries, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and carrier-specific costs directly related to the carrier's allocated share of the regional local number portability administrator's costs, except that per-line monthly number-portability query/administration charges shall be assigned as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to monthly number-portability charges.</P>
              <P>(i) Such incumbent local exchange carriers may assess a separate monthly number-portability charge as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but such charge may recover only the costs incurred to implement number portability functionality and shall not include costs recovered through the monthly number-portability query/administration charge.</P>
              <P>(ii) The monthly number-portability query/administration charge may end no later than five years after the incumbent local exchange carrier's monthly number-portability query/administration charge takes effect. The monthly number-portability query/administration charge may be collected over a different five-year period than the monthly number-portability charge. These five-year periods may run either consecutively or concurrently, in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(b) All telecommunications carriers other than incumbent local exchange carriers may recover their number portability costs in any manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) As used in this section, warehousing is the practice whereby Responsible Organizations, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate, reserve toll free numbers from the Service Management System database without having an actual toll free subscriber for whom those numbers are being reserved.</P>
              <P>(b) Responsible Organizations shall not warehouse toll free numbers. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a Responsible Organization is warehousing toll free numbers if:</P>
              <P>(1) The Responsible Organization does not have an identified toll free subscriber agreeing to be billed for service associated with each toll free number reserved from the Service Management System database; or</P>
              <P>(2) The Responsible Organization does not have an identified toll free subscriber agreeing to be billed for service associated with a toll free number before switching that toll free number from reserved or assigned to working status.</P>
              <P>(c) Responsible Organizations shall not maintain a toll free number in reserved status if there is not a prospective toll free subscriber requesting that toll free number.</P>
              <P>(d) A Responsible Organization's act of reserving a number from the Service Management System database shall serve as that Responsible Organization's certification that there is an identified toll free subscriber agreeing to be billed for service associated with the toll free number.</P>

              <EXTRACT>

                <P>[T]he Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has concluded that warehousing, which the FCC defines as Responsible Organizations, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate, reserving toll free numbers from the SMS database without having an identified toll free subscriber from whom those numbers are being reserved, is an unreasonable practice under § 201(b) of the Communications Act and is inconsistent with the Commission's obligation under § 251(e) of the Communications Act to ensure that numbers are made available on an equitable basis; and if a Responsible Organization does not have an identified toll free subscriber agreeing to be billed for service associated with each toll free number reserved from the database, or if a Responsible Organization does not have an identified, billed toll free subscriber before switching a number from reserved or assigned to working status, then there is a rebuttable presumption that the Responsible Organization is <PRTPAGE P="113"/>warehousing numbers. Responsible Organizations that warehouse numbers will be subject to penalties.</P>

              <P>(a) As used in this section, hoarding is the acquisition by a toll free subscriber from a Responsible Organization of more toll free numbers than the toll free subscriber intends to use for the provision of toll free service. The definition of hoarding also includes number brokering, which is the selling of a toll free number by a private entity for a fee.</P>
              <P>(1) Toll free subscribers shall not hoard toll free numbers.</P>
              <P>(2) No person or entity shall acquire a toll free number for the purpose of selling the toll free number to another entity or to a person for a fee.</P>
              <P>(3) Routing multiple toll free numbers to a single toll free subscriber will create a rebuttable presumption that the toll free subscriber is hoarding or brokering toll free numbers.</P>

                <P>[T]he Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has concluded that hoarding, defined as the acquisition of more toll free numbers than one intends to use for the provision of toll free service, as well as the sale of a toll free number by a private entity for a fee, is contrary to the public interest in the conservation of the scarce toll free number resource and contrary to the FCC's responsibility to promote the orderly use and allocation of toll free numbers.</P>

Unless otherwise ordered, any persons suspended or debarred shall be excluded from activities associated with or related to the schools and libraries support mechanism, the high-cost support mechanism, the rural health care support mechanism, and the low-income support mechanism. Suspension and debarment of a person other than an individual constitutes suspension and debarment of all divisions and/or other organizational elements from participation in the program for the suspension and debarment period, unless the notice of suspension and proposed debarment is limited by its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements or to specific types of transactions.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures for suspension and debarment.</E> The suspension and debarment process shall proceed as follows:</P>

              <P>(ii) Explain the applicable debarment procedures;</P>
              <P>(iii) Describe the effect of debarment.</P>

              <P>(3) A person subject to proposed debarment, or who has an existing contract with a person subject to proposed debarment or intends to contract with such a person to provide or receive services in matters arising out of activities associated with or related to the schools and libraries support mechanism, the high-cost support mechanism, the rural health care support <PRTPAGE P="126"/>mechanism, and the low-income support mechanism may contest debarment or the scope of the proposed debarment. A person contesting debarment or the scope of proposed debarment must file arguments and any relevant documentation within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice or publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> whichever is earlier.</P>

              <P>(4) A person subject to proposed debarment, or who has an existing contract with a person subject to proposed debarment or intends to contract with such a person to provide or receive services in matters arising out of activities associated with or related to the schools and libraries support mechanism, the high-cost support mechanism, the rural health care support mechanism, and the low-income support mechanism may also contest suspension or the scope of suspension, but such action will not ordinarily be granted. A person contesting suspension or the scope of suspension must file arguments and any relevant documentation within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice or publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> whichever is earlier.</P>

              <P>(5) Within ninety (90) days of receipt of any information submitted by the respondent, the Commission, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, shall provide the respondent prompt notice of the decision to debar. Debarment shall be effective upon the earlier of receipt of notice or publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reversal or limitation of suspension or debarment.</E> The Commission may reverse a suspension or debarment, or limit the scope or period of suspension or debarment, upon a finding of extraordinary circumstances, after due consideration following the filing of a petition by an interested party or upon motion by the Commission. Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the suspension and debarment was based is an example of extraordinary circumstances.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Time period for debarment.</E> A debarred person shall be prohibited from involvement with the schools and libraries support mechanism for three (3) years from the date of debarment. The Commission may, if necessary to protect the public interest, set a longer period of debarment or extend the existing period of debarment.

              <SUBJECT>Additional requirements for Commission designation of eligible telecommunications carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to be designated an eligible telecommunications carrier under section 214(e)(6), any common carrier in its application must:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Certify that it will comply with the service requirements applicable to the support that it receives.</P>
              <P>(ii) Submit a five-year plan that describes with specificity proposed improvements or upgrades to the applicant's network throughout its proposed service area. Each applicant shall estimate the area and population that will be served as a result of the improvements. Except, a common carrier seeking designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier in order to provide supported services only under subpart E of this part does not need to submit such a five-year plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate its ability to remain functional in emergency situations, including a demonstration that it has a reasonable amount of back-up power to ensure functionality without an external power source, is able to reroute traffic around damaged facilities, and is capable of managing traffic spikes resulting from emergency situations.</P>
              <P>(3) Demonstrate that it will satisfy applicable consumer protection and service quality standards. A commitment by wireless applicants to comply with the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association's Consumer Code for Wireless Service will satisfy this requirement. Other commitments will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(4) For common carriers seeking designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier for purposes of receiving support only under subpart E of this part, demonstrate that it is financially and technically capable of providing the Lifeline service in compliance with subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(5) For common carriers seeking designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier for purposes of receiving support only under subpart E of this part, submit information describing the terms and conditions of any voice telephony service plans offered to Lifeline subscribers, including details on the number of minutes provided as part of the plan, additional charges, if any, for toll calls, and rates for each such plan. To the extent the eligible telecommunications carrier offers plans to Lifeline subscribers that are generally available to the public, it may provide summary information regarding such plans, such as a link to a public Web site outlining the terms and conditions of such plans.</P>

              <P>(6) For common carriers seeking designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier for purposes of receiving support only under subpart E of this part, submit information describing the terms and conditions of any broadband Internet access service plans offered to Lifeline subscribers, including details on the speeds offered, data usage allotments, additional charges for particular uses, if any, and rates for each such plan. To the extent the eligible telecommunications carrier offers plans to Lifeline subscribers that are generally available to the public, it <PRTPAGE P="129"/>may provide summary information regarding such plans, such as a link to a public Web site outlining the terms and conditions of such plans.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Public interest standard.</E> Prior to designating an eligible telecommunications carrier pursuant to section 214(e)(6), the Commission determines that such designation is in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(c) A common carrier seeking designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier under section 214(e)(6) for any part of Tribal lands shall provide a copy of its petition to the affected tribal government and tribal regulatory authority, as applicable, at the time it files its petition with the Federal Communications Commission. In addition, the Commission shall send any public notice seeking comment on any petition for designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier on Tribal lands, at the time it is released, to the affected tribal government and tribal regulatory authority, as applicable, by the most expeditious means available.</P>
              <P>(d) A common carrier seeking designation as a Lifeline Broadband Provider eligible telecommunications carrier must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. The Commission shall process such petitions for designation as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the petitioning common carrier has offered broadband Internet access service to the public for at least two years before the date of the filing and serves at least 1,000 non-Lifeline customers with voice telephony and/or broadband Internet access service as of the date of the filing, the common carrier's petition for designation as a Lifeline Broadband Provider eligible telecommunications carrier shall be deemed granted within 60 days of the submission of a completed filing unless the Commission notifies the common carrier that the grant will not be automatically effective.</P>
              <P>(2) If the petitioning common carrier provides service on Tribal lands and is a facilities-based provider more than 50 percent owned by one or more federally recognized Tribal Nations or Tribal consortia and actually controlled by one or more federally recognized Tribal Nations or Tribal consortia, the common carrier's petition for designation as a Lifeline Broadband Provider eligible telecommunications carrier shall be deemed granted within 60 days of the submission of a completed filing unless the Commission notifies the common carrier that the grant will not be automatically effective.</P>
              <P>(3) If the petitioning common carrier does not qualify under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the common carrier's petition for designation as a Lifeline Broadband Provider eligible telecommunications carrier shall be acted upon within six months of the submission of a completed filing.</P>
              <P>(e) A provider designated as a Lifeline Broadband Provider (LBP) may obtain designation as an LBP in additional service areas by submitting to the Commission a request identifying the service areas in which the LBP plans to offer Lifeline-supported service and a certification that there has been no material change to the information submitted in the petition for which the LBP received designation as an LBP. Such a request shall be deemed granted five business days after it is submitted to the Commission, unless the Commission notifies the applicant that the grant will not be automatically effective.</P>

              <P>(ii) The state commission's ruling or other official statement presenting the state commission's reasons for adopting its proposed definition, including an analysis that takes into account the recommendations of any Federal-State Joint Board convened to provide recommendations with respect to the definition of a service area served by a rural telephone company.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commission shall issue a Public Notice of any such petition within fourteen (14) days of its receipt.</P>
              <P>(3) The Commission may initiate a proceeding to consider the petition within ninety (90) days of the release date of the Public Notice.</P>

If it proposes such different definition, the Commission shall seek the agreement of the state commission according to this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) The Commission shall submit a petition to the state commission according to that state commission's procedures. The petition submitted to the relevant state commission shall contain:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sale or transfer of exchanges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this section shall not be used to determine support for any price cap incumbent local exchange carrier or a rate-of-return carrier, as that term is defined in § 54.5, that is affiliated with a price cap incumbent local exchange carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) Beginning January 1, 2012, any carrier subject to the provisions of this paragraph shall receive support pursuant to this paragraph or support based on the actual costs of the acquired exchanges, whichever is less. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a carrier that acquires telephone exchanges from an unaffiliated carrier shall receive universal service support for the acquired exchanges at the same per-line support levels for which those exchanges were eligible prior to the transfer of the exchanges. If the acquired exchanges are incorporated into an existing rural incumbent local exchange carrier study area, the rural incumbent local exchange carrier shall maintain the costs associated with the acquired exchanges separate from the costs associated with its pre-acquisition study area. The transferred exchanges may be eligible for safety valve support for loop related costs pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) A carrier that has entered into a binding agreement to buy or acquire exchanges from an unaffiliated carrier prior to May 7, 1997 will receive universal service support for the newly acquired lines based upon the average cost of all of its lines, both those newly acquired and those it had prior to execution of the sales agreement.</P>
              <P>(d) Transferred exchanges in study areas operated by rural telephone companies that are subject to the limitations on loop-related universal service support in paragraph (b) of this section may be eligible for a safety valve loop cost expense adjustment based on the difference between the rural incumbent local exchange carrier's index year expense adjustment and subsequent year loop cost expense adjustments for the acquired exchanges. Safety valve loop cost expense adjustments shall only be available to rural incumbent local exchange carriers that, in the absence of restrictions on high-cost loop support in paragraph (b) of this section, would qualify for high-cost loop support for the acquired exchanges under § 54.1310.</P>

              <P>(1) For carriers that buy or acquire telephone exchanges on or after January 10, 2005, from an unaffiliated carrier, the index year expense adjustment for the acquiring carrier's first year of operation shall equal the selling carrier's loop-related expense adjustment for the transferred exchanges for the 12-month period prior to the transfer of the exchanges. At the acquiring carrier's option, the first year of operation for the transferred exchanges, for purposes of calculating safety valve support, shall commence at the beginning <PRTPAGE P="134"/>of either the first calendar year or the next calendar quarter following the transfer of exchanges. For the first year of operation, a loop cost expense adjustment, using the costs of the acquired exchanges submitted in accordance with §§ 54.1305 and 54.1306, shall be calculated pursuant to § 54.1310 and then compared to the index year expense adjustment. Safety valve support for the first period of operation will then be calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The index year expense adjustment for years after the first year of operation shall be determined using cost data for the first year of operation of the transferred exchanges. Such cost data for the first year of operation shall be calculated in accordance with §§ 54.1305, 54.1306, and 54.1310. For each year, ending on the same calendar quarter as the first year of operation, a loop cost expense adjustment, using the loop costs of the acquired exchanges, shall be submitted and calculated pursuant to §§ 54.1305, 54.1306, and 54.1310 and will be compared to the index year expense adjustment. Safety valve support for the second year of operation and thereafter will then be calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For carriers that bought or acquired exchanges from an unaffiliated carrier before January 10, 2005, and are not subject to the exception in paragraph (c) of this section, the index year expense adjustment for acquired exchange(s) shall be equal to the rural incumbent local exchange carrier's high-cost loop expense adjustment for the acquired exchanges calculated for the carrier's first year of operation of the acquired exchange(s). At the carrier's option, the first year of operation of the transferred exchanges shall commence at the beginning of either the first calendar year or the next calendar quarter following the transfer of exchanges. The index year expense adjustment shall be determined using cost data for the acquired exchange(s) submitted in accordance with §§ 54.1305 and 54.1306 and shall be calculated in accordance with § 54.1310. The index year expense adjustment for rural telephone companies that have operated exchanges subject to this section for more than a full year on August 8, 2014 shall be based on loop cost data submitted in accordance with § 54.1306 for the year ending on the nearest calendar quarter following August 8, 2014. For each subsequent year, ending on the same calendar quarter as the index year, a loop cost expense adjustment, using the costs of the acquired exchanges, will be calculated pursuant to § 54.1310 and will be compared to the index year expense adjustment. Safety valve support is calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Up to fifty (50) percent of any positive difference between the transferred exchanges loop cost expense adjustment and the index year expense adjustment will be designated as the transferred exchange's safety valve loop cost expense adjustment and will be available in addition to the per-line loop-related support transferred from the selling carrier to the acquiring carrier pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. In no event shall a study area's safety valve loop cost expense adjustment exceed the difference between the carrier's study area loop cost expense adjustment calculated pursuant to § 54.1310 and transferred support amounts available to the acquired exchange(s) under paragraph (b) of this section. Safety valve support shall not transfer with acquired exchanges.</P>

              <P>(e) The sum of the safety valve loop cost expense adjustment for all eligible study areas operated by rural telephone companies shall not exceed five (5) percent of the total rural incumbent local exchange carrier portion of the annual nationwide loop cost expense adjustment calculated pursuant to § 54.1302. The five (5) percent cap on the safety valve mechanism shall be based on the lesser of the rural incumbent local exchange carrier portion of the annual nationwide loop cost expense adjustment calculated pursuant to § 54.1302 or the sum of rural incumbent local exchange carrier expense adjustments calculated pursuant to § 54.1310. The percentage multiplier used to derive study area safety valve loop cost expense adjustments for rural telephone companies shall be the lesser of fifty (50) percent or a percentage calculated to produce the maximum total <PRTPAGE P="135"/>safety valve loop cost expense adjustment for all eligible study areas pursuant to this paragraph. The safety valve loop cost expense adjustment of an individual rural incumbent local exchange carrier also may be further reduced as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) Once an acquisition is complete, the acquiring rural incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide written notice to the Administrator that it has acquired access lines that may be eligible for safety valve support. Rural telephone companies also shall provide written notice to the Administrator defining their index year for those years after the first year of operation for purposes of calculating the safety valve loop cost expense adjustment.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Calculation of support.</E> A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier shall receive universal service support to the extent that the competitive eligible telecommunications carrier captures the subscriber lines of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) <PRTPAGE P="136"/>or serves new subscriber lines in the incumbent LEC's service area.</P>
              <P>(1) A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier serving loops in the service area of a rural incumbent local exchange carrier, as that term is defined in § 54.5 of this chapter, shall receive support for each line it serves in a particular service area based on the support the incumbent LEC would receive for each such line, disaggregated by cost zone if disaggregation zones have been established within the service area pursuant to § 54.315 of this subpart. A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier serving loops in the service area of a non-rural incumbent local exchange carrier shall receive support for each line it serves in a particular wire center based on the support the incumbent LEC would receive for each such line. A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier serving loops in the service area of a rate-of-return carrier shall be eligible to receive Interstate Common Line Support for each line it serves in the service area in accordance with the formula in § 54.901.</P>
              <P>(2) A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that uses switching purchased as unbundled network elements pursuant to § 51.307 of this chapter to provide the supported services shall receive the lesser of the unbundled network element price for switching or the per-line DEM support of the incumbent LEC, if any. A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that uses loops purchased as unbundled network elements pursuant to § 51.307 of this chapter to provide the supported services shall receive the lesser of the unbundled network element price for the loop or the incumbent LEC's per-line payment from the high-cost loop support, LTS, and Interstate Common Line Support mechanisms, if any. The incumbent LEC providing nondiscriminatory access to unbundled network elements to such competitive eligible telecommunications carrier shall receive the difference between the level of universal service support provided to the competitive eligible telecommunications carrier and the per-customer level of support that the incumbent LEC would have received.</P>
              <P>(3) A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that provides the supported services using neither unbundled network elements purchased pursuant to § 51.307 of this chapter nor wholesale service purchased pursuant to section 251(c)(4) of the Act will receive the full amount of universal service support that the incumbent LEC would have received for that customer.</P>

              <P>(b) In order to receive support pursuant to this subpart, a competitive eligible telecommunications carrier must report to the Administrator the number of working loops it serves in a service area pursuant to the schedule set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. For a competitive eligible telecommunications carrier serving loops in the service area of a rural incumbent local exchange carrier, as that term is defined in § 54.5, the carrier must report, by customer class, the number of working loops it serves in the service area, disaggregated by cost zone if disaggregation zones have been established within the service area pursuant to § 54.315. For a competitive eligible telecommunications carrier serving loops in the service area of a non-rural telephone company, the carrier must report the number of working loops it serves in the service area, by customer class if the non-rural telephone company receives Interstate Common Line Support pursuant to § 54.901 and by disaggregation zone if disaggregation zones have been established within the service area pursuant to § 54.315 of this subpart, and the number of working loops it serves in each wire center in the service area. For universal service support purposes, working loops are defined as the number of working Exchange Line C&amp;WF loops used jointly for exchange and message telecommunications service, including C&amp;WF subscriber lines associated with pay telephones in C&amp;WF Category 1, but excluding WATS closed end access and TWX service. Competitive eligible telecommunications carriers providing mobile wireless service in an incumbent LEC's service area shall use the customer's billing address for purposes of identifying the service location of a mobile wireless customer in a service area.<PRTPAGE P="137"/>

              <SUBJECT>Broadband public interest obligations for recipients of high-cost support.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Rate-of-return carrier recipients of high-cost support are required to offer broadband service, at speeds described below, with latency suitable for real-time applications, including Voice over Internet Protocol, and usage capacity that is reasonably comparable <PRTPAGE P="141"/>to comparable offerings in urban areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates for comparable offerings in urban areas. For purposes of determining reasonable comparability of rates, recipients are presumed to meet this requirement if they offer rates at or below the applicable benchmark to be announced annually by public notice issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau.</P>
              <P>(1) Carriers that elect to receive Connect America Fund-Alternative Connect America Cost Model (CAF-ACAM) support pursuant to § 54.311 are required to offer broadband service at actual speeds of at least 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream to a defined number of locations as specified by public notice, with a minimum usage allowance of 150 GB per month, subject to the requirement that usage allowances remain consistent with median usage in the United States over the course of the term. In addition, such carriers must offer other speeds to subsets of locations, as specified below:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fully funded locations.</E> Fully funded locations are those locations identified by the Alternative-Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM) where the average cost is above the funding benchmark and at or below the funding cap. Carriers are required to offer broadband speeds to locations that are fully funded, as specified by public notice at the time of authorization, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Carriers with a state-level density of more than 10 housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 75 percent of all fully funded locations in the state by the end of the ten-year period.</P>
              <P>(B) Carriers with a state-level density of 10 or fewer, but more than five, housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 50 percent of fully funded locations in the state by the end of the ten-year period.</P>
              <P>(C) Carriers with a state-level density of five or fewer housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 25 percent of fully funded locations in the state by the end of the ten-year period.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Capped locations.</E> Capped locations are those locations in census blocks for which A-CAM calculates an average cost per location above the funding cap. Carriers are required to offer broadband speeds to locations that are receiving capped support, as specified by public notice at the time of authorization, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Carriers with a state-level density of more than 10 housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 4 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream to 50 percent of all capped locations in the state by the end of the ten-year period.</P>
              <P>(B) Carriers with a state-level density of 10 or fewer housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 4 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream to 25 percent of capped locations in the state by the end of the ten-year period.</P>
              <P>(C) Carriers shall provide to all other capped locations, upon reasonable request, broadband at actual speeds of at least 4 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream.</P>
              <P>(iii) Revised A-CAM I carriers, as defined by § 54.311(a)(2), must offer the following broadband speeds to locations that are fully funded, as specified by public notice at the time of the authorizations, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Revised A-CAM I carriers with a state-level density of more than 10 housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 85 percent of all fully funded locations in the state by the end of the term.</P>

              <P>(B) Revised A-CAM I carriers with a state-level density of 10 or fewer, but more than five, housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at <PRTPAGE P="142"/>least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 65 percent of fully funded locations in the state by the end of the term.</P>
              <P>(C) Revised A-CAM I carriers with a state-level density of five or fewer housing units per square mile, as specified by public notice at the time of election, are required to offer broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 50 percent of fully funded locations in the state by the end of the term.</P>
              <P>(iv) A-CAM II carriers, as defined by § 54.311(a)(3), must offer broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream to 100 percent of fully funded locations in the state by the end of the term, and therefore have no additional 10/1 Mbps obligation.</P>
              <P>(2) Rate-of-return recipients of Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (CAF BLS) shall be required to offer broadband service at actual speeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream, over a five-year period, to a defined number of unserved locations as specified by public notice, as determined by the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Percentage of CAF BLS.</E> Each rate-of-return carrier is required to target a defined percentage of its five-year forecasted CAF BLS support to the deployment of broadband service to locations that are unserved with 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream broadband service as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Rate-of-return carriers with less than 20 percent deployment of 25/3 Mbps broadband service in their study areas, as determined by the Bureau, will be required to use 35 percent of their five-year forecasted CAF BLS support to extend broadband service where it is currently lacking.</P>
              <P>(B) Rate-of-return carriers with more than 20 percent but less than 40 percent deployment of 25/3 Mbps broadband service in their study areas, as determined by the Bureau, will be required to use 25 percent of their five-year forecasted CAF BLS support to extend broadband service where it is currently lacking.</P>
              <P>(C) Rate-of-return carriers with more than 40 percent deployment of 25/3 Mbps broadband service in their study areas, as determined by the Bureau, will be required to use 20 percent of their five-year forecasted CAF BLS support to extend broadband service where it is currently lacking.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cost per location.</E> The deployment obligation shall be determined by dividing the amount of support set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by a cost per location figure based on one of two methodologies, at the carrier's election:</P>
              <P>(A) The higher of:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The weighted average unseparated cost per loop for carriers of similar density that offer 25/3 Mbps or better broadband service to at least 95 percent of locations, based on the most current FCC Form 477 data as determined by the Bureau, but excluding carriers subject to the current per-line per-month cap set forth in § 54.302 and carriers subject to limitations on operating expenses set forth in § 54.303; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) 150% of the weighted average of the cost per loop for carriers of similar density, but excluding carriers subject to the per line per month cap set forth in § 54.302 and carriers subject to limitations on operating expenses set forth in § 54.303, with a similar level of deployment of 25/3 Mbps or better broadband based on the most current FCC Form 477 data, as determined by Bureau; or</P>
              <P>(B) The average cost per location for census blocks lacking 25/3 Mbps broadband service in the carrier's study area as determined by the A-CAM.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Restrictions on deployment obligations.</E> No rate-of-return carrier shall deploy terrestrial wireline technology in any census block if doing so would result in total support per line in the study area to exceed the per-line per-month cap in § 54.302.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Future deployment obligations.</E> Prior to publishing the deployment obligations for subsequent five-year periods, the Administrator shall update the unseparated average cost per loop amounts for carriers with 95 percent or greater deployment of the then-current standard, based on the then-current NECA cost data, and the Wireline Competition Bureau shall examine the density groupings and make any necessary adjustments based on then-current U.S. Census data.<PRTPAGE P="143"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Rate-of-return carrier recipients of high-cost support are required upon reasonable request to bid on category one telecommunications and Internet access services in response to a posted FCC Form 470 seeking broadband service that meets the connectivity targets for the schools and libraries universal service support program for eligible schools and libraries (as described in § 54.501) within that carrier's service area. Such bids must be at rates reasonably comparable to rates charged to eligible schools and libraries in urban areas for comparable offerings.</P>
              <P>(c) Alaskan rate-of-return carriers receiving support from the Alaska Plan pursuant to § 54.306 are exempt from paragraph (a) of this section and are instead required to offer voice and broadband service with latency suitable for real-time applications, including Voice over Internet Protocol, and usage capacity that is reasonably comparable to comparable offerings in urban areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates for comparable offerings in urban areas, subject to any limitations in access to backhaul as described in § 54.313(g). Alaska Plan recipients' specific broadband deployment and speed obligations shall be governed by the terms of their approved performance plans as described in § 54.306(b). Alaska Plan recipients must also comply with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Mobile carriers that are receiving support from the Alaska Plan pursuant to § 54.317(e) shall certify in their annual compliance filings that their rates are reasonably comparable to rates for comparable offerings in urban areas. The mobile carrier must also demonstrate compliance at the end of the five-year milestone and 10-year milestone and may do this by showing that its required stand-alone voice plan, and one service plan that offers broadband data services, if it offers such plans, are:</P>
              <P>(1) Substantially similar to a service plan offered by at least one mobile wireless service provider in the cellular market area (CMA) for Anchorage, Alaska, and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Frozen High-Cost Support.</E> Beginning January 1, 2012, each price cap local exchange carrier and rate-of-return carrier affiliated with a price cap local exchange carrier will have a “baseline support amount” equal to its total 2011 support in a given study area, or an amount equal to $3,000 times the number of reported lines for 2011, whichever is lower. For purposes of this section, price cap carriers are defined pursuant to § 61.3(aa) of this chapter and affiliated companies are determined by § 32.9000 of this chapter. Each price cap local exchange carrier and rate-of-return carrier affiliated with a price cap local exchange carrier will have a “monthly baseline support amount” equal to its baseline support amount divided by twelve. Beginning January 1, 2012, on a monthly basis, eligible carriers will receive their monthly baseline support amount.</P>
              <P>(1) “Total 2011 support” is the amount of support disbursed to a price cap local exchange carrier or rate-of-return carrier affiliated with a price cap local exchange carrier for 2011, without regard to prior period adjustments related to years other than 2011 and as determined by USAC on January 31, 2012.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purpose of calculating the $3,000 per line limit, the average of lines reported by a price cap local exchange carrier or rate-of-return carrier affiliated with a price cap local exchange carrier pursuant to line count filings required for December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2011 shall be used.</P>
              <P>(3) A carrier receiving frozen high cost support under this rule shall be deemed to be receiving Interstate Access Support and Interstate Common Line Support equal to the amount of support the carrier to which the carrier was eligible under those mechanisms in 2011.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Incremental Support in 2012.</E> From January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, support in addition to baseline support defined in paragraph (a) of this section will be available for certain price cap local exchange carriers and rate-of-return carriers affiliated with price cap local exchange carriers as follows.</P>
              <P>(1) For each carrier for which the Wireline Competition Bureau determines that it has appropriate data or for which it determines that it can make reasonable estimates, the Bureau will determine an average per-location cost for each wire center using a simplified cost-estimation function derived from the Commission's cost model. Incremental support will be based on the wire centers for which the estimated per-location cost exceeds the funding threshold. The funding threshold will be determined by calculating which funding threshold would allocate all available incremental support, if each carrier that would be offered incremental support were to accept it.</P>

              <P>(2) An eligible telecommunications carrier accepting incremental support <PRTPAGE P="148"/>must deploy broadband to a number of unserved locations, as shown as unserved by fixed broadband on the then-current version of the National Broadband Map, equal to the amount of incremental support it accepts divided by $775.</P>
              <P>(3) A carrier may elect to accept or decline incremental support. A holding company may do so on a holding-company basis on behalf of its operating companies that are eligible telecommunications carriers, whose eligibility for incremental support, for these purposes, shall be considered on an aggregated basis. A carrier must provide notice to the Commission, relevant state commissions, and any affected Tribal government, stating the amount of incremental support it wishes to accept and identifying the areas by wire center and census block in which the designated eligible telecommunications carrier will deploy broadband to meet its deployment obligation, or stating that it declines incremental support. Such notification must be made within 90 days of being notified of any incremental support for which it would be eligible. Along with its notification, a carrier accepting incremental support must also submit a certification that the locations to be served to satisfy the deployment obligation are not shown as served by fixed broadband provided by any entity other than the certifying entity or its affiliate on the then-current version of the National Broadband Map; that, to the best of the carrier's knowledge, the locations are, in fact, unserved by fixed broadband; that the carrier's current capital improvement plan did not already include plans to complete broadband deployment within the next three years to the locations to be counted to satisfy the deployment obligation; and that incremental support will not be used to satisfy any merger commitment or similar regulatory obligation. If a carrier intends to deploy to census blocks not initially identified at the time of election, it must inform the Commission, the Administrator, relevant state commissions, and any affected Tribal government of the change at least 90 days prior to commencing deployment in the new census blocks. No sooner than 46 days after the Wireline Competition Bureau issues a public notice announcing the updated deployment plans but prior to commencing deployment, the carrier must make the certifications described in this paragraph with respect to the new census blocks. If a carrier no longer intends to deploy to a previously identified census block, it must inform the Commission, the Administrator, relevant state commission, and any affected Tribal government prior to filing its certification pursuant to § 54.313(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Incremental Support in 2013.</E> From January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013, support in addition to baseline support defined in paragraph (a) of this section will be available for certain price cap local exchange carriers and rate-of-return carriers affiliated with price cap local exchange carriers as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For each carrier for which the Wireline Competition Bureau determines that it has appropriate data or for which it determines that it can make reasonable estimates, the Bureau will determine an average per-location cost for each wire center using a simplified cost-estimation function derived from the Commission's high-cost proxy model. Incremental support will be based on the wire centers for which the estimated per-location cost exceeds the funding threshold. The funding threshold will be determined by calculating which funding threshold would allocate all available incremental support, if each carrier that would be offered incremental support were to accept it.</P>
              <P>(2) An eligible telecommunications carrier accepting incremental support must deploy broadband to a number of unserved locations, shown as unserved by fixed Internet access with speeds of at least 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream on the then-current version of the National Broadband Map, equal to the amount of incremental support it accepts divided by $775.</P>

              <P>(3) An eligible telecommunications carrier must accept funding pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section before it may accept funding pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If an eligible telecommunications carrier has committed to deploy to all locations <PRTPAGE P="149"/>eligible for support under paragraph (c)(2) of this section on routes or projects that can economically be built with $775 in Connect America funding for each location unserved by 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream plus an equal amount of non-Connect America carrier capital expenditure funding, but the carrier has not fully utilized its allotted funding, it may also count towards its deployment obligation locations shown as unserved by fixed Internet access with speeds of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream equal to the amount of remaining incremental support divided by $550.</P>
              <P>(4) A carrier may elect to accept or decline incremental support. A holding company may do so on a holding-company basis on behalf of its operating companies that are eligible telecommunications carriers, whose eligibility for incremental support, for these purposes, shall be considered on an aggregated basis. A carrier must provide notice to the Commission, the Administrator, relevant state commissions, and any affected Tribal government, stating the amount of incremental support it wishes to accept, the number of locations at the $775 amount, and the number of locations at the $550 amount, and identifying the areas by wire center and census block in which the designated eligible telecommunications carrier will deploy broadband to meet its deployment obligation; or stating that it declines incremental support. Such notification must be made within 75 days of being notified of any incremental support for which it would be eligible. If a carrier intends to deploy to census blocks not initially identified at the time of election, it must inform the Commission, the Administrator, relevant state commissions, and any affected Tribal government of the change at least 90 days prior to commencing deployment in the new census blocks. No sooner than 46 days after the Wireline Competition Bureau issues a public notice announcing the updated deployment plans but prior to commencing deployment, the carrier must make the certifications described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to the new census blocks. If a carrier no longer intends to deploy to a previously identified census block, it must inform the Commission, the Administrator, relevant state commission, and any affected Tribal government prior to filing its certification pursuant to § 54.313(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(5) Along with its notification, an eligible telecommunications carrier accepting incremental support must submit the following certifications:</P>
              <P>(i) The locations to be served to satisfy the deployment obligation are not shown as served by fixed broadband at the speeds specified in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section provided by any entity other than the certifying entity or its affiliate on the then-current version of the National Broadband Map or that it is challenging the National Broadband Map's designation of that census block under the challenge process in paragraph (c)(7) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) To the best of the carrier's knowledge, the locations are, in fact, unserved by fixed Internet access with speeds of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream, or 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(iii) The carrier's current capital improvement plan did not already include plans to complete broadband deployment within the next three years to the locations to be counted to satisfy the deployment obligation;</P>
              <P>(iv) Incremental support will not be used to satisfy any merger commitment or similar regulatory obligation; and</P>
              <P>(v) The carrier has undertaken due diligence to determine the locations in question are not within the service area of either Broadband Initiatives Program or the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program projects that will provide Internet access with speeds of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 upstream.</P>

              <P>(6) An eligible telecommunications carrier deploying to locations unserved by 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream under paragraph (c)(3) of this section must also certify that it has prioritized its planned projects or routes so as to maximize the deployment of broadband-capable infrastructure to locations lacking Internet access with speeds of 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) A person may challenge the designation of a census block as served or unserved by a certain speed as shown on the National Broadband Map. When the Wireline Competition Bureau determines that the evidence presented makes it more likely than not that the census block should be designated as served by broadband with speeds of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream, that locations in that census block will be treated as served by broadband and therefore ineligible to be counted for the purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. When the Wireline Competition Bureau determines that the evidence presented makes it more likely than not that the census block should be designated as served by Internet service with speeds of 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream, but unserved by broadband with speeds of at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream, locations in that census block will be treated as served by Internet access with speeds of 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream and therefore eligible to be counted for the purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. When the Wireline Competition Bureau determines that the evidence presented makes it more likely than not that the census block should be designated as unserved by Internet service with speeds of 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream, locations in that census block will be treated as unserved by Internet access with speeds of 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream and therefore eligible to be counted for the purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If no entity other than the carrier or its affiliate provides Internet service with speeds of 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream or greater as shown on the National Broadband Map or as determined by the process described in paragraph (c)(7), the carrier may satisfy its deployment obligations at a location shown by the National Broadband Map as being served by that carrier or its affiliate with such service by certifying that it is the only entity providing such service, that the location does not actually receive speeds of 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream, and the location is served through a copper-fed digital subscriber line access multiplexer. The carrier must specifically identify such locations in its election. Such locations will be treated the same as locations under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) An eligible telecommunications carrier must complete deployment of broadband-capable infrastructure to two-thirds of the required number of locations within two years of providing notification of acceptance of funding, and must complete deployment to all required locations within three years. To satisfy its deployment obligation, the eligible telecommunications carrier must offer broadband service to such locations of at least 4 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream, with latency sufficiently low to enable the use of real-time communications, including Voice over Internet Protocol, and with usage allowances, if any, associated with a specified price for a service offering that are reasonably comparable to comparable offerings in urban areas.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligibility for support after Connect America Phase II auction.</E> (1) A price cap carrier that receives monthly baseline support pursuant to this section and is a winning bidder in the Connect America Phase II auction shall receive support at the same level as described in paragraph (a) of this section for such area until the Wireline Competition Bureau determines whether to authorize the carrier to receive Connect America Phase II auction support for the same area. Upon the Wireline Competition Bureau's release of a public notice approving a price cap carrier's application submitted pursuant to § 54.315(b) and authorizing the carrier to receive Connect America Fund Phase II auction support, the carrier shall no longer receive support at the level of monthly baseline support pursuant to this section for such area. Thereafter, the carrier shall receive monthly support in the amount of its Connect America Phase II winning bid.</P>

              <P>(2) Starting the first day of the month following the first authorization of Connect America Phase II auction support nationwide, no price cap carrier that receives monthly baseline support pursuant to this section shall receive such monthly baseline support <PRTPAGE P="151"/>for areas that are ineligible for Connect America Phase II auction support.</P>
              <P>(3) To the extent Connect America Phase II auction support is not awarded at auction for an eligible area, as determined by the Wireline Competition Bureau, the price cap carrier shall have the option of continuing to receive support at the level described in paragraph (a) of this section until further Commission action.</P>
              <P>(4) Starting the first day of the month following the authorization of Connect America Phase II auction support to a winning bidder other than the price cap carrier that receives monthly baseline support pursuant to this section for such area, the price cap carrier shall no longer receive monthly baseline support pursuant to this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the phase-down of support below the level described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to the restrictions in Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Public Law 114-113, Div. E, Title VI, section 631, 129 Stat. 2242, 2470 (2015), unless and until such restrictions are no longer in effect.</P>

              <P>(i) Once the recipient has met its 60 percent service milestone, it may obtain a new letter of credit or renew its existing letter of credit so that it is valued at a minimum at 90 percent of the total support amount already disbursed plus the amount that will be disbursed in the coming year.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once the recipient has met its 80 percent service milestone, it may obtain a new letter of credit or renew its existing letter of credit so that it is valued at a minimum at 60 percent of the total support that has been disbursed plus the amount that will be disbursed in the coming year.</P>

              <P>(i) Failure by a Phase II auction support recipient to meet its service milestones as required by § 54.310 will trigger reporting obligations and the withholding of support as described in § 54.320(c). Failure to come into full compliance within 12 months will trigger a recovery action by the Universal Service Administrative Company. If the Phase II recipient does not repay the requisite amount of support within six months, the Universal Service Administrative Company will be entitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of credit and may disqualify the Phase II auction support recipient from the receipt of Phase II auction support or additional universal service support.</P>
              <P>(ii) The default will be evidenced by a letter issued by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau or the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, or their respective designees, which letter, attached to a standby letter of credit draw certificate, shall be sufficient for a draw on the standby letter of credit for the entire amount of the standby letter of credit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Alaska Plan for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers serving remote Alaska.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Election of support.</E> Subject to the requirements of this section, certain competitive eligible telecommunications carriers serving remote areas in Alaska, as defined in § 54.307(e)(3)(i), shall have a one-time option to elect to participate in the Alaska Plan. Carriers exercising this option with approved performance plans shall have their support frozen for a period of ten years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, at a date set by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, notwithstanding § 54.307.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Carriers eligible for support.</E> A competitive eligible telecommunications carrier shall be eligible for frozen support pursuant to the Alaska Plan if that carrier serves remote areas in Alaska as defined by § 54.307(e)(3)(i) and if that carrier certified that it served covered locations in Alaska in its September 30, 2011, filing of line counts with the Administrator and submitted a performance plan by August 23, 2016.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim support for remote areas in Alaska.</E> From January 1, 2012, until December 31, 2016, competitive eligible telecommunications carriers subject to the delayed phase down for remote areas in Alaska pursuant to § 54.307(e)(3) shall receive support as calculated in § 54.307(e)(3)(v).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Support amounts and support term.</E> For a period of 10 years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, at a date set by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, notwithstanding § 54.307, each Alaska Plan participant shall receive monthly Alaska Plan support in an amount equal to the annualized monthly support amount it received for December 2014. Alaska Plan participants shall no longer be required to file line counts.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of frozen support.</E> Frozen support allocated through the Alaska Plan may only be used to provide mobile voice and mobile broadband service in those census blocks in remote areas of <PRTPAGE P="164"/>Alaska, as defined in § 54.307(e)(3)(i), that did not, as of December 31, 2014, receive 4G LTE service directly from providers that were either unsubsidized or ineligible to claim the delayed phase down under § 54.307(e)(3) and covering, in the aggregate, at least 85 percent of the population of the block. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit the use of frozen support to build or upgrade middle-mile infrastructure outside such remote areas of Alaska if such middle mile infrastructure is necessary to the provision of mobile voice and mobile broadband service in such remote areas. Alaska Plan participants may use frozen support to provide mobile voice and mobile broadband service in remote areas of Alaska served by competitive eligible telecommunications carrier partners of ineligible carriers if those areas are served using the competitive eligible telecommunications carrier's infrastructure.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Performance plans.</E> In order to receive support pursuant to this section, a competitive eligible telecommunications carrier must be subject to a performance plan approved by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. The performance plan must indicate specific deployment obligations and performance requirements sufficient to demonstrate that support is being used in the public interest and in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements adopted by the Commission for the Alaska Plan. For each level of wireless service offered (2G/Voice, 3G, and 4G LTE) and each type of middle mile used in connection with that level of service, the performance plan must specify minimum speeds that will be offered to a specified population by the end of the fifth year of support and by the end of the tenth year of support. Alaska Plan participants shall, no later than the end of the fourth year of the ten-year term, review and modify their end-of-term commitments in light of any new developments, including newly available infrastructure. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau may require the filing of revised commitments at other times if justified by developments that occur after the approval of the initial performance commitments. If the specific performance obligations are not achieved in the time period identified in the approved performance plans the carrier shall be subject to § 54.320(c) and (d).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Phase down of non-participating competitive eligible telecommunications carrier high-cost support.</E> Notwithstanding § 54.307, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, support distributed in Alaska on or after January 1, 2017 to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers that serve areas in Alaska other than remote areas of Alaska, that are ineligible for frozen support under paragraphs (b) or (e) of this section, or that do not elect to receive support under this section, shall be governed by this paragraph. Such support shall be subject to phase down in three years as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, except that carriers that are not signatories to the Alaska Plan will instead be subject to a three-year phase down commencing on September 1, 2017, and competitive eligible telecommunications carriers that are signatories to the Alaska Plan but did not submit a performance plan by August 23, 2016 shall not receive support in remote areas beginning January 1, 2017.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance and recordkeeping for the high-cost program.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Eligible telecommunications carriers authorized to receive universal service high-cost support are subject to random compliance audits and other investigations to ensure compliance with program rules and orders.<PRTPAGE P="166"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) All eligible telecommunications carriers shall retain all records required to demonstrate to auditors that the support received was consistent with the universal service high-cost program rules. This documentation must be maintained for at least ten years from the receipt of funding. All such documents shall be made available upon request to the Commission and any of its Bureaus or Offices, the Administrator, and their respective auditors.</P>
              <P>(c) Eligible telecommunications carriers authorized to receive high-cost support that fail to comply with public interest obligations or any other terms and conditions may be subject to further action, including the Commission's existing enforcement procedures and penalties, reductions in support amounts, potential revocation of ETC designation, and suspension or debarment pursuant to § 54.8.</P>
              <P>(d) Eligible telecommunications carriers subject to defined build-out milestones must notify the Commission and USAC, and the relevant state, U.S. Territory, or Tribal government, if applicable, within 10 business days after the applicable deadline if they have failed to meet a build-out milestone.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Interim build-out milestones.</E> Upon notification that an eligible telecommunications carrier has defaulted on an interim build-out milestone after it has begun receiving high-cost support, the Wireline Competition Bureau—or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau in the case of mobile carrier participants—will issue a letter evidencing the default. For purposes of determining whether a default has occurred, a carrier must be offering service meeting the requisite performance obligations. The issuance of this letter shall initiate reporting obligations and withholding of a percentage of the eligible telecommunication carrier's total monthly high-cost support, if applicable, starting the month following the issuance of the letter:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Tier 1.</E> If an eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of at least five percent but less than 15 percent of the number of locations that the eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have built out to or, in the case of Alaska Plan mobile-carrier participants, population covered by the specified technology, middle mile, and speed of service in the carrier's approved performance plan, by the interim milestone, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, will issue a letter to that effect. Starting three months after the issuance of this letter, the eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file a report every three months identifying the geocoded locations to which the eligible telecommunications carrier has newly deployed facilities capable of delivering broadband meeting the requisite requirements with Connect America support in the previous quarter, or, in the case of Alaska Plan mobile-carrier participants, the populations to which the competitive eligible telecommunications carrier has extended or upgraded service meeting their approved performance plan and obligations. Eligible telecommunications carriers that do not file these quarterly reports on time will be subject to support reductions as specified in § 54.313(j). The eligible telecommunications carrier must continue to file quarterly reports until the eligible telecommunications carrier reports that it has reduced the compliance gap to less than five percent of the required number of locations (or population, if applicable) for that interim milestone and the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issues a letter to that effect.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tier 2.</E> If an eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of at least 15 percent but less than 25 percent of the number of locations that the eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have built out to or, in the case of Alaska Plan mobile-carrier participants, population covered by the specified technology, middle mile, and speed of service in the carrier's approved performance plan, by the interim milestone, USAC will withhold 15 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for that state and the eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file quarterly reports. Once the eligible telecommunications carrier has reported that it has reduced <PRTPAGE P="167"/>the compliance gap to less than 15 percent of the required number of locations (or population, if applicable) for that interim milestone for that state, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect, USAC will stop withholding support, and the eligible telecommunications carrier will receive all of the support that had been withheld. The eligible telecommunications carrier will then move to Tier 1 status.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tier 3.</E> If an eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of at least 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the number of locations that the eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have built out to by the interim milestone, or, in the case of Alaska Plan mobile-carrier participants, population covered by the specified technology, middle mile, and speed of service in the carrier's approved performance plan, USAC will withhold 25 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for that state and the eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file quarterly reports. Once the eligible telecommunications carrier has reported that it has reduced the compliance gap to less than 25 percent of the required number of locations (or population, if applicable) for that interim milestone for that state, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect, the eligible telecommunications carrier will move to Tier 2 status.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Tier 4.</E> If an eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of 50 percent or more of the number of locations that the eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have built out to or, in the case of Alaska Plan mobile-carrier participants, population covered by the specified technology, middle mile, and speed of service in the carrier's approved performance plan, by the interim milestone:</P>
              <P>(A) USAC will withhold 50 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for that state, and the eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file quarterly reports. As with the other tiers, as the eligible telecommunications carrier reports that it has lessened the extent of its non-compliance, and the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issues a letter to that effect, it will move down the tiers until it reaches Tier 1 (or no longer is out of compliance with the relevant interim milestone).</P>
              <P>(B) If after having 50 percent of its support withheld for six months the eligible telecommunications carrier has not reported that it is eligible for Tier 3 status (or one of the other lower tiers), USAC will withhold 100 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support and will commence a recovery action for a percentage of support that is equal to the eligible telecommunications carrier's compliance gap plus 10 percent of the ETC's support that has been disbursed to that date.</P>
              <P>(v) If at any point during the support term, the eligible telecommunications carrier reports that it is eligible for Tier 1 status, it will have its support fully restored, USAC will repay any funds that were recovered or withheld, and it will move to Tier 1 status.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Final milestone.</E> Upon notification that the eligible telecommunications carrier has not met a final milestone, the eligible telecommunications carrier will have twelve months from the date of the final milestone deadline to come into full compliance with this milestone. If the eligible telecommunications carrier does not report that it has come into full compliance with this milestone within twelve months, the Wireline Competition Bureau—or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau in the case of mobile carrier participants—will issue a letter to this effect. In the case of Alaska Plan mobile carrier participants, USAC will then recover the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received by that carrier over the 10-year term for the relevant percentage of population. For other recipients of high-cost support, USAC will then recover the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received in the state for that carrier over the term of support for the relevant number of locations plus 10 <PRTPAGE P="168"/>percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's total relevant high-cost support over the support term for that state.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance reviews.</E> If subsequent to the eligible telecommunications carrier's support term, USAC determines in the course of a compliance review that the eligible telecommunications carrier does not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is offering service to all of the locations required by the final milestone or, in the case of Alaska Plan participants, did not provide service consistent with the carrier's approved performance plan, USAC shall recover a percentage of support from the eligible telecommunications carrier as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application of Lifeline discount amount.</E> (1) Eligible telecommunications carriers that charge federal End User Common Line charges or equivalent federal charges must apply federal Lifeline support to waive the federal End User Common Line charges for Lifeline subscribers if the carrier is seeking Lifeline reimbursement for eligible voice telephony service provided to those subscribers. Such carriers must apply any additional federal support amount to a qualifying low-income consumer's intrastate rate, if the carrier has received the non-federal regulatory approvals necessary to implement the required rate reduction. Other eligible telecommunications carriers must apply the federal Lifeline support amount, plus any additional support amount, to reduce the cost of any generally available residential service plan or package offered by such carriers that provides at least one supported service as described in § 54.101(a), and charge Lifeline subscribers the resulting amount.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">State certification.</E> An eligible telecommunications carrier operating in a state that provides an approved valid certification to the Commission in accordance with this section is not required to comply with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to the eligible telecommunications carriers' subscribers in that state. A valid certification must include a statement that the state has a comprehensive system in place to prevent duplicative federal Lifeline support that is at least as robust as the system adopted by the Commission and that incorporates information from all eligible telecommunications carriers receiving low-income support in the state and their subscribers. A valid certification must also describe in detail how the state system functions and for each requirement adopted by the Commission to prevent duplicative support, how the state system performs the equivalent functions. The certification must be submitted to the Commission no later than six months from the effective date of this section of the Commission's rules to be valid. Such certification will be considered approved unless the Wireline Competition Bureau rejects the certification within 90 days of filing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The National Lifeline Accountability Database.</E> In order to receive Lifeline support, eligible telecommunications carriers operating in states that have not provided the Commission with approved valid certification pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) All eligible telecommunications carriers must query the National Lifeline Accountability Database to determine whether a prospective subscriber who has executed a certification pursuant to § 54.410(d) is currently receiving a Lifeline service from another eligible telecommunications carrier; and whether anyone else living at the prospective subscriber's residential address is currently receiving a Lifeline service.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Database indicates that a prospective subscriber, who is not seeking to port his or her telephone number, is currently receiving a Lifeline service, the eligible telecommunications carrier must not provide and shall not seek or receive Lifeline reimbursement for that subscriber.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Database indicates that another individual at the prospective subscriber's residential address is currently receiving a Lifeline service, the eligible telecommunications carrier must not seek and will not receive Lifeline reimbursement for providing service to that prospective subscriber, unless the prospective subscriber has certified, pursuant to § 54.410(d) that to the best of his or her knowledge, no one in his or her household is already receiving a Lifeline service.</P>
              <P>(4) An eligible telecommunications carrier is not required to comply with paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section if it receives notice from a state Lifeline administrator or other state agency that the administrator or other agency has queried the Database about a prospective subscriber and that providing the prospective subscriber with a Lifeline benefit would not result in duplicative support.</P>
              <P>(5) Eligible telecommunications carriers may query the Database only for the purposes provided in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, and to determine whether information with respect to its subscribers already in the Database is correct and complete.</P>

              <P>(6) Eligible telecommunications carriers must transmit to the Database in a format prescribed by the Administrator each new and existing Lifeline subscriber's full name; full residential address; date of birth and the last four digits of the subscriber's Social Security number or Tribal Identification number, if the subscriber is a member of a Tribal nation and does not have a Social Security number; the telephone number associated with the Lifeline service; the date on which the Lifeline service was initiated; the date on which the Lifeline service was terminated, if it has been terminated; the amount of support being sought for that subscriber; and the means through which the subscriber qualified for Lifeline.<PRTPAGE P="173"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) In the event that two or more eligible telecommunications carriers transmit the information required by this paragraph to the Database for the same subscriber, only the eligible telecommunications carrier whose information was received and processed by the Database first, as determined by the Administrator, will be entitled to reimbursement from the Fund for that subscriber.</P>
              <P>(8) All eligible telecommunications carriers must update an existing Lifeline subscriber's information in the Database within ten business days of receiving any change to that information, except as described in paragraph (b)(10) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) All eligible telecommunications carriers must obtain, from each new and existing subscriber, consent to transmit the subscriber's information. Prior to obtaining consent, the eligible telecommunications carrier must describe to the subscriber, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the Administrator to ensure the proper administration of the Lifeline program, and that failure to provide consent will result in subscriber being denied the Lifeline service.</P>
              <P>(10) When an eligible telecommunications carrier de-enrolls a subscriber, it must transmit to the Database the date of Lifeline service de-enrollment within one business day of de-enrollment.</P>

              <P>(11) All eligible telecommunications carriers must securely retain subscriber documentation that the ETC reviewed to verify subscriber eligibility, for the purposes of production during audits or investigations or to the extent required by NLAD processes, which require, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> verification of eligibility, identity, address, and age.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tribal Link Up and the National Lifeline Accountability Database.</E> In order to receive universal service support reimbursement for Tribal Link Up, eligible telecommunications carriers operating in states that have not provided the Commission with a valid certification pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, must comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Such eligible telecommunications carriers must query the Database to determine whether a prospective Link Up recipient who has executed a certification pursuant to § 54.410(d) has previously received a Link Up benefit at the residential address provided by the prospective subscriber.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Database indicates that a prospective subscriber has received a Link Up benefit at the residential address provided by the subscriber, the eligible telecommunications provider must not seek Link Up reimbursement for that subscriber.</P>
              <P>(3) An eligible telecommunications carrier is not required to comply with paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(2) of this section, if it receives notice from a state Lifeline administrator or other state agency that the administrator or other agency has queried the Database about a prospective subscriber and that providing the prospective subscriber with a Link Up benefit would not result in duplicative support or support to a subscriber who had already received Link Up support at that residential address.</P>
              <P>(4) All eligible telecommunications carriers must transmit to the Database in a format prescribed by the Administrator each new and existing Link Up recipient's full name; residential address; date of birth; and the last four digits of the subscriber's Social Security number, or Tribal identification number if the subscriber is a member of a Tribal nation and does not have a Social Security number; the telephone number associated with the Link Up support; and the date of service activation. Where two or more eligible telecommunications carriers transmit the information required by this paragraph to the Database for the same subscriber, only the eligible telecommunications carrier whose information was received and processed by the Database first, as determined by the Administrator, will be entitled to reimbursement from the Fund for that subscriber.</P>

              <P>(5) All eligible telecommunications carriers must obtain, from each new and existing subscriber, consent to transmit the information required in paragraph (c) of this section. Prior to <PRTPAGE P="174"/>obtaining consent, the eligible telecommunications carrier must describe to the subscriber, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the Administrator to ensure the proper administration of the Link Up program, and that failure to provide consent will result in the subscriber being denied the Link Up benefit.</P>

              <P>All eligible telecommunications carriers must:</P>
              <P>(a) Make available Lifeline service, as defined in § 54.401, to qualifying low-income consumers.</P>
              <P>(b) Publicize the availability of Lifeline service in a manner reasonably designed to reach those likely to qualify for the service.</P>
              <P>(c) Indicate on all materials describing the service, using easily understood language, that it is a Lifeline service, that Lifeline is a government assistance program, the service is non-transferable, only eligible consumers may enroll in the program, and the program is limited to one discount per household. For the purposes of this section, the term “materials describing the service” includes all print, audio, video, and web materials used to describe or enroll in the Lifeline service offering, including application and certification forms.</P>
              <P>(d) Disclose the name of the eligible telecommunications carrier on all materials describing the service.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">De-enrollment</E>—(1) <E T="03">De-enrollment generally.</E> If an eligible telecommunications carrier has a reasonable basis to believe that a Lifeline subscriber no longer meets the criteria to be considered a qualifying low-income consumer under § 54.409, the carrier must notify the subscriber of impending termination of his or her Lifeline service. Notification of impending termination must be sent in writing separate from the subscriber's monthly bill, if one is provided, and must be written in clear, easily understood language. A carrier providing Lifeline service in a state that has dispute resolution procedures applicable to Lifeline termination that requires, at a minimum, written notification of impending termination, must comply with the applicable state requirements. The carrier must allow a subscriber 30 days following the date of the impending termination letter required to demonstrate continued eligibility. A subscriber making such a demonstration must present proof of continued eligibility to the carrier consistent with applicable annual re-certification requirements, as described in § 54.410(f). An eligible telecommunications carrier must de-enroll any subscriber who fails to demonstrate eligibility within five business days after the expiration of the subscriber's time to respond. A carrier providing Lifeline service in a state that has dispute resolution procedures applicable to Lifeline termination must comply with the applicable state requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">De-enrollment for duplicative support.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, upon notification by the Administrator to any eligible telecommunications carrier that a subscriber is receiving Lifeline service from another eligible telecommunications carrier or that more than one member of a subscriber's household is receiving Lifeline service and therefore that the subscriber should be de-enrolled from participation in that carrier's Lifeline program, the eligible telecommunications carrier must de-enroll the subscriber from participation in that carrier's Lifeline program within five business days. An eligible telecommunications carrier shall not be eligible for Lifeline reimbursement for any de-enrolled subscriber following the date of that subscriber's de-enrollment.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">De-enrollment for non-usage.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a Lifeline subscriber fails to use, as “usage” is defined in § 54.407(c)(2), for 30 consecutive days a Lifeline service that does not require the eligible telecommunications carrier to assess and collect a monthly fee from its subscribers, an eligible telecommunications carrier must provide the subscriber 15 days' notice, using clear, easily understood language, that the subscriber's failure to use the Lifeline service within the 15-day notice <PRTPAGE P="175"/>period will result in service termination for non-usage under this paragraph. Eligible telecommunications carriers shall report to the Commission annually the number of subscribers de-enrolled for non-usage under this paragraph. This de-enrollment information must be reported by month and must be submitted to the Commission at the time an eligible telecommunications carrier submits its annual certification report pursuant to § 54.416.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">De-enrollment for failure to re-certify.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an eligible telecommunications carrier must de-enroll a Lifeline subscriber who does not respond to the carrier's attempts to obtain re-certification of the subscriber's continued eligibility as required by § 54.410(f); or who fails to provide the annual one-per-household re-certifications as required by § 54.410(f). Prior to de-enrolling a subscriber under this paragraph, the eligible telecommunications carrier must notify the subscriber in writing separate from the subscriber's monthly bill, if one is provided, using clear, easily understood language, that failure to respond to the re-certification request will trigger de-enrollment. A subscriber must be given 60 days to respond to recertification efforts. If a subscriber does not respond to the carrier's notice of impending de-enrollment, the carrier must de-enroll the subscriber from Lifeline within five business days after the expiration of the subscriber's time to respond to the re-certification efforts.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">De-enrollment requested by subscriber.</E> If an eligible telecommunications carrier receives a request from a subscriber to de-enroll, it must de-enroll the subscriber within two business days after the request.</P>

              <P>(c) Minimum service standards will be updated using the following mechanisms:</P>
              <P>(1) Fixed broadband will have minimum service standards for speed and data usage allowance. The standards will updated as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) The standard for fixed broadband speed will be updated on an annual basis. The standard will be set at the 30th percentile, rounded up to the nearest Megabit-per-second integer, of subscribed fixed broadband downstream and upstream speeds. The 30th percentile will be determined by analyzing <PRTPAGE P="177"/>FCC Form 477 Data. The new standard will be published in a Public Notice issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau on or before July 31, which will give the new minimum standard for the upcoming year. In the event that the Bureau does not release a Public Notice, or the data are older than 18 months, the minimum standard will be the greater of:</P>
              <P>(A) The current minimum standard; or</P>
              <P>(B) The Connect America Fund minimum speed standard for rate-of-return fixed broadband providers, as set forth in 47 CFR 54.308(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) The standard for fixed broadband data usage allowance will be updated on an annual basis. The new standard will be published in a Public Notice issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau on or before July 31, which will give the new minimum standard for the upcoming year. The updated standard will be the greater of:</P>
              <P>(A) An amount the Wireline Competition Bureau deems appropriate, based on what a substantial majority of American consumers already subscribe to, after analyzing Urban Rate Survey data and other relevant data; or</P>
              <P>(B) The minimum standard for data usage allowance for rate-of-return fixed broadband providers set in the Connect America Fund.</P>
              <P>(2) Mobile broadband will have minimum service standards for speed and capacity. The standards will be updated as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The standard for mobile broadband speed will be updated when, after analyzing relevant data, including the FCC Form 477 data, the Wireline Competition Bureau determines such an adjustment is necessary. If the standard for mobile broadband speed is updated, the new standard will be published in a Public Notice issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau.</P>
              <P>(ii) The standard for mobile broadband capacity will be updated on an annual basis. The standard will be determined by:</P>

              <P>(A) Dividing the total number of mobile-cellular subscriptions in the United States, as reported in the <E T="03">Mobile Competition Report</E> by the total number of American households, as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau, in order to determine the number of mobile-cellular subscriptions per American household. This number will be rounded to the hundredths place and then multiplied by;</P>

              <P>(B) The percentage of Americans who own a smartphone, according to the Commission's annual <E T="03">Mobile Competition Report.</E> This number will be rounded to the hundredths place and then multiplied by;</P>

              <P>(C) The average data used per mobile smartphone subscriber, as reported by the Commission in its annual <E T="03">Mobile Competition Report.</E> This number will be rounded to the hundredths place and then multiplied by;</P>
              <P>(D) Seventy (70) percent. The result will then be rounded up to the nearest 250 MB interval to provide the new monthly minimum service standard for the mobile broadband data usage allowance.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the Wireline Competition Bureau does not release a Public Notice giving new minimum standards for mobile broadband capacity on or before July 31, or if the necessary data needed to calculate the new minimum standard are older than 18 months, the data usage allowance will be updated by multiplying the current data usage allowance by the percentage of the year-over-year change in average mobile data usage per smartphone user, as reported in the <E T="03">Mobile Competition Report.</E> That amount will be rounded up to the nearest 250 MB.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exception for certain fixed broadband providers.</E> Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section, the Lifeline discount may be applied for fixed broadband service that does not meet the minimum standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

Acceptable documentation of program eligibility includes the current or prior year's statement of benefits from a qualifying assistance program, a notice or letter of participation in a qualifying assistance program, program participation documents, or another official document demonstrating that the prospective subscriber, one or more of the prospective subscriber's dependents or the prospective subscriber's household receives benefits from a qualifying assistance program.</P>

              <P>(ii) The subscriber will notify the carrier within 30 days if for any reason he or she no longer satisfies the criteria for receiving Lifeline including, as relevant, if the subscriber no longer meets the income-based or program-based criteria for receiving Lifeline support, the subscriber is receiving more than one Lifeline benefit, or another member of the subscriber's household is receiving a Lifeline benefit.</P>

              <P>(2) In order to re-certify a subscriber's eligibility, an eligible telecommunications carrier must confirm a subscriber's current eligibility to receive Lifeline by:</P>
              <P>(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility databases, confirming that the subscriber still meets the program-based eligibility requirements for Lifeline, and documenting the results of that review; or</P>

If a Federal eligibility recertification form is available, entities enrolling subscribers must use such form to re-certify a qualifying low-income consumer.</P>
              <P>(iv) In states in which the National Verifier has been implemented, the eligible telecommunications carrier cannot re-certify subscribers not found in the National Verifier by obtaining a certification form from the subscriber.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-certification of a subscriber's Lifeline eligibility, the National Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or state agency must confirm a subscriber's current eligibility to receive a Lifeline service by:</P>

              <P>(iii) If the subscriber's eligibility for Lifeline cannot be determined by accessing one or more databases containing information regarding enrollment in qualifying assistance programs, then the National Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or state agency may obtain a signed certification from the subscriber on a form that meets the certification requirements in paragraph (d) of this section. If a Federal eligibility recertification form is available, entities enrolling subscribers must use such form to recertify a qualifying low-income consumer.</P>
              <P>(4) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-certification of subscribers' Lifeline eligibility, the National Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or other state agency must provide to each eligible telecommunications carrier the results of its annual re-certification efforts with respect to that eligible telecommunications carrier's subscribers.</P>
              <P>(5) If an eligible telecommunications carrier is unable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by the National Verifier, a state Lifeline administrator, or other state agency that it is unable to re-certify a subscriber, the eligible telecommunications carrier must comply with the de-enrollment requirements provided for in § 54.405(e)(4).</P>

              <P>(a) For purposes of this subpart, the term “Tribal Link Up” means an assistance program for eligible residents of Tribal lands, if the subscriber's location is rural, as defined in § 54.505(b)(3)(i) and (ii), seeking telecommunications service from a telecommunications carrier that is receiving high-cost support on rural Tribal lands, pursuant to subpart D of this part, that provides:</P>

              <P>(1) A 100 percent reduction, up to $100, of the customary charge for commencing telecommunications service for a single telecommunications connection at a subscriber's principal place of residence imposed by an eligible telecommunications carrier that is also receiving high-cost support on rural Tribal lands, pursuant to subpart D of this part. For purposes of this subpart, a “customary charge for commencing telecommunications service” is the ordinary charge an eligible telecommunications carrier imposes and collects from all subscribers to initiate service with that eligible telecommunications carrier. A charge imposed only on qualifying low-income consumers to initiate service is not a customary <PRTPAGE P="184"/>charge for commencing telecommunications service. Activation charges routinely waived, reduced, or eliminated with the purchase of additional products, services, or minutes are not customary charges eligible for universal service support; and</P>
              <P>(2) A deferred schedule of payments of the customary charge for commencing telecommunications service for a single telecommunications connection at a subscriber's principal place of residence imposed by an eligible telecommunications carrier that is also receiving high-cost support on rural Tribal lands, pursuant to subpart D of this part, for which the eligible resident of rural Tribal lands does not pay interest. The interest charges not assessed to the eligible resident of rural Tribal lands shall be for a customary charge for connecting the telecommunications service of up to $200 and such interest charges shall be deferred for a period not to exceed one year.</P>
              <P>(b) An eligible resident of rural Tribal lands may receive the benefit of the Tribal Link Up program for a second or subsequent time only for otherwise qualifying commencement of telecommunications service at a principal place of residence with an address different from the address for which Tribal Link Up assistance was provided previously.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Supported services.</E> All supported services are listed in the Eligible Services List as updated annually in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The services in this subpart will be supported in addition to all reasonable charges that are incurred by taking such services, such as state and federal taxes. Charges for termination liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges not included in the cost of taking such service shall not be covered by the universal service support mechanisms. The supported services fall within the following general categories:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Category one.</E> Telecommunications services, telecommunications, and Internet access, as defined in § 54.5 and described in the Eligible Services List are category one supported services.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Category two.</E> Internal connections, basic maintenance and managed internal broadband services as defined in § 54.500 and described in the Eligible Services List are category two supported services.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Funding years 2015-2019.</E> Libraries, schools, or school districts with schools that receive funding for category two services in any of the funding years between 2015 and 2019 shall be eligible for support for category two services pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Five-year budget.</E> Each eligible school or library shall be eligible for a budgeted amount of support for category two services over a five-year funding cycle beginning the first funding year support is received. Excluding support for internal connections received prior to funding year 2015, each school or library shall be eligible for the total available budget less any support received for category two services in the prior funding years of that school's or library's five-year funding cycle. The budgeted amounts and the <PRTPAGE P="191"/>funding floor shall be adjusted for inflation annually in accordance with § 54.507(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">School budget.</E> Each eligible school shall be eligible for support for category two services up to a pre-discount price of $150 per student over a five-year funding cycle. Applicants shall provide the student count per school, calculated at the time that the discount is calculated each funding year. New schools may estimate the number of students, but shall repay any support provided in excess of the maximum budget based on student enrollment the following funding year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Library budget.</E> Each eligible library shall be eligible for support for category two services, up to a pre-discount price of $2.30 per square foot over a five-year funding cycle. Libraries shall provide the total area for all floors, in square feet, of each library outlet separately, including all areas enclosed by the outer walls of the library outlet and occupied by the library, including those areas off-limits to the public.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Funding floor.</E> Each eligible school and library will be eligible for support for category two services up to at least a pre-discount price of $9,200 over five funding years.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Requests.</E> Applicants shall request support for category two services for each school or library based on the number of students per school building or square footage per library building. Category two funding for a school or library may not be used for another school or library. If an applicant requests less than the maximum budget available for a school or library, the applicant may request the remaining balance in a school's or library's category two budget in subsequent funding years of a five year cycle. The costs for category two services shared by multiple eligible entities shall be divided reasonably between each of the entities for which support is sought in that funding year.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Non-instructional buildings.</E> Support is not available for category two services provided to or within non-instructional school buildings or separate library administrative buildings unless those category two services are essential for the effective transport of information to or within one or more instructional buildings of a school or non-administrative library buildings, or the Commission has found that the use of those services meets the definition of educational purpose, as defined in § 54.500. When applying for category two support for eligible services to a non-instructional school building or library administrative building, the applicant shall allocate the cost of providing services to one or more of the eligible school or library buildings that benefit from those services being provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Funding year 2020 and beyond.</E> Absent further action from the Commission, each eligible library or school in a school district that either did not receive funding for category two services in funding years 2015 through 2019 or has completed its five-year funding cycle, shall be eligible for support for category two services, except basic maintenance services, no more than twice every five funding years. For the purpose of determining eligibility, the five-year period begins in any funding year in which the school or library receives discounted category two services other than basic maintenance services. If a school or library receives category two services other than basic maintenance services that are shared with other schools or libraries (for example, as part of a consortium), the shared services will be attributed to the school or library in determining whether it is eligible for support. Support is not available for category two services provided to or within non-instructional school buildings or separate library administrative buildings unless those category two services are essential for the effective transport of information to or within one or more instructional buildings of a school or non-administrative library buildings, or the Commission has found that the use of those services meets the definition of educational purpose, as defined in § 54.500.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligible services list process.</E> The Administrator shall submit by March 30 of each year a draft list of services eligible for support, based on the Commission's rules for the following funding year. The Wireline Competition Bureau will issue a Public Notice seeking <PRTPAGE P="192"/>comment on the Administrator's proposed eligible services list. The final list of services eligible for support will be released at least 60 days prior to the opening of the application filing window for the following funding year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Competitive bidding requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) All entities participating in the schools and libraries universal service support program must conduct a fair and open competitive bidding process, consistent with all requirements set forth in this subpart.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to paragraph (<E T="01">a</E>):</HD>
                <P>The following is an illustrative list of activities or behaviors that would not result in a fair and open competitive bidding process: the applicant for supported services has a relationship with a service provider that would unfairly influence the outcome of a competition or would furnish the service provider with inside information; someone other than the applicant or an authorized representative of the applicant prepares, signs, and submits the FCC Form 470 and certification; a service provider representative is listed as the FCC Form 470 contact person and allows that service provider to participate in the competitive bidding process; the service provider prepares the applicant's FCC Form 470 or participates in the bid evaluation or vendor selection process in any way; the applicant turns over to a service provider the responsibility for ensuring a fair and open competitive bidding process; an applicant employee with a role in the service provider selection process also has an ownership interest in the service provider seeking to participate in the competitive bidding process; and the applicant's FCC Form 470 does not describe the supported services with sufficient specificity to enable interested service providers to submit responsive bids.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Competitive bid requirements.</E> Except as provided in § 54.511(c), an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library shall seek competitive bids, pursuant to the requirements established in this subpart, for all services eligible for support under § 54.502. These competitive bid requirements apply in addition to state and local competitive bid requirements and are not intended to preempt such state or local requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Posting of FCC Form 470.</E> (1) An eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library seeking bids for eligible services under this subpart shall submit a completed FCC Form 470 to the Administrator to initiate the competitive bidding process. The FCC Form 470 and any request for proposal cited in the FCC Form 470 shall include, at a minimum, the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) A list of specified services for which the school, library, or consortium requests bids;</P>
              <P>(ii) Sufficient information to enable bidders to reasonably determine the needs of the applicant;</P>
              <P>(iii) To the extent an applicant seeks the following services or arrangements, an indication of the applicant's intent to seek:</P>
              <P>(A) Construction of network facilities that the applicant will own;</P>
              <P>(B) A dark-fiber lease, indefeasible right of use, or other dark-fiber service agreement or the modulating electronics necessary to light dark fiber; or</P>
              <P>(C) A multi-year installment payment agreement with the service provider for the non-discounted share of special construction costs;</P>
              <P>(iv) To the extent an applicant seeks construction of a network that the applicant will own, the applicant must also solicit bids for both the services provided over third-party networks and construction of applicant-owned network facilities, in the same request for proposals;</P>
              <P>(v) To the extent an applicant seeks bids for special construction associated with dark fiber or bids to lease and light dark fiber, the applicant must also solicit bids to provide the needed services over lit fiber; and</P>
              <P>(vi) To the extent an applicant seeks bids for equipment and maintenance costs associated with lighting dark fiber, the applicant must include these elements in the same FCC Form 470 as the dark fiber.</P>
              <P>(2) The FCC Form 470 shall be signed by a person authorized to request bids for eligible services for the eligible school, library, or consortium, including such entities.</P>

              <P>(i) A person authorized to request bids on behalf of the entities listed on <PRTPAGE P="193"/>an FCC Form 470 shall certify under oath that:</P>
              <P>(A) The schools meet the statutory definition of “elementary school” or “secondary school” as defined in § 54.500 of these rules, do not operate as for-profit businesses, and do not have endowments exceeding $50 million.</P>
              <P>(B) The libraries or library consortia eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act of 1996 do not operate as for-profit businesses and have budgets that are completely separate from any school (including, but not limited to, elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities).</P>
              <P>(C) Support under this support mechanism is conditional upon the school(s) and library(ies) securing access to all of the resources, including computers, training, software, maintenance, internal connections, and electrical connections necessary to use the services purchased effectively.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person authorized to both request bids and order services on behalf of the entities listed on an FCC Form 470 shall, in addition to making the certifications listed in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, certify under oath that:</P>
              <P>(A) The services the school, library, or consortium purchases at discounts will be used primarily for educational purposes and will not be sold, resold, or transferred in consideration for money or any other thing of value, except as allowed by § 54.513.</P>
              <P>(B) All bids submitted for eligible products and services will be carefully considered, with price being the primary factor, and the bid selected will be for the most cost-effective service offering consistent with § 54.511.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator shall post each FCC Form 470 that it receives from an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library on its Web site designated for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(4) After posting on the Administrator's Web site an eligible school, library, or consortium FCC Form 470, the Administrator shall send confirmation of the posting to the entity requesting service. That entity shall then wait at least four weeks from the date on which its description of services is posted on the Administrator's Web site before making commitments with the selected providers of services. The confirmation from the Administrator shall include the date after which the requestor may sign a contract with its chosen provider(s).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Gift restrictions.</E> (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section, an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library may not directly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value from a service provider participating in or seeking to participate in the schools and libraries universal service program. No such service provider shall offer or provide any such gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other thing of value except as otherwise provided herein. Modest refreshments not offered as part of a meal, items with little intrinsic value intended solely for presentation, and items worth $20 or less, including meals, may be offered or provided, and accepted by any individuals or entities subject to this rule, if the value of these items received by any individual does not exceed $50 from any one service provider per funding year. The $50 amount for any service provider shall be calculated as the aggregate value of all gifts provided during a funding year by the individuals specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this paragraph:</P>

              <P>(i) The terms “school, library, or consortium” include all individuals who are on the governing boards of such entities (such as members of a school committee), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants or independent contractors of such entities involved on behalf of such school, library, or consortium with the Schools and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund (E-rate Program), including individuals who prepare, approve, sign or submit E-rate applications, or other forms related to the E-rate Program, or who prepare bids, communicate or work with E-rate service providers, E-rate consultants, or with USAC, as well as any staff of <PRTPAGE P="194"/>such entities responsible for monitoring compliance with the E-rate Program; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “service provider” includes all individuals who are on the governing boards of such an entity (such as members of the board of directors), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, or independent contractors of such entities.</P>
              <P>(3) The restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall not be applicable to the provision of any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value, to the extent given to a family member or a friend working for an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library, provided that such transactions:</P>
              <P>(i) Are motivated solely by a personal relationship,</P>
              <P>(ii) Are not rooted in any service provider business activities or any other business relationship with any such eligible school, library, or consortium, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Are provided using only the donor's personal funds that will not be reimbursed through any employment or business relationship.</P>
              <P>(4) Any service provider may make charitable donations to an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library in the support of its programs as long as such contributions are not directly or indirectly related to E-rate procurement activities or decisions and are not given by service providers to circumvent competitive bidding and other E-rate program rules, including those in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, requiring schools and libraries to pay their own non-discount share for the services they are purchasing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemption to competitive bidding requirements.</E> An applicant that seeks support for commercially available high-speed Internet access services for a pre-discount price of $3,600 or less per school or library annually is exempt from the competitive bidding requirements in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Internet access, as defined in § 54.5, is eligible for this exemption only if the purchased service offers at least 100 Mbps downstream and 10 Mbps upstream.</P>
              <P>(2) The Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, is delegated authority to lower the annual cost of high-speed Internet access services or raise the speed threshold of broadband services eligible for this competitive bidding exemption, based on a determination of what rates and speeds are commercially available prior to the start of the funding year.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of the FCC Form 471.</E> An eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library seeking to receive discounts for eligible services under this subpart shall, upon entering into a signed contract or other legally binding agreement for eligible services, submit a completed FCC Form 471 to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(1) The FCC Form 471 shall be signed by the person authorized to order eligible services for the eligible school, library, or consortium and shall include that person's certification under oath that:</P>
              <P>(i) The schools meet the statutory definition of “elementary school” or “secondary school” as defined in § 54.500 of this subpart, do not operate as for-profit businesses, and do not have endowments exceeding $50 million.</P>
              <P>(ii) The libraries or library consortia eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act of 1996 do not operate as for-profit businesses and whose budgets are completely separate from any school (including, but not limited to, elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities).</P>

              <P>(iii) The entities listed on the FCC Form 471 application have secured access to all of the resources, including <PRTPAGE P="195"/>computers, training, software, maintenance, internal connections, and electrical connections, necessary to make effective use of the services purchased. The entities listed on the FCC Form 471 will pay the discounted charges for eligible services from funds to which access has been secured in the current funding year or, for entities that will make installment payments, they will ensure that they are able to make all required installment payments. The billed entity will pay the non-discount portion of the cost of the goods and services to the service provider(s).</P>
              <P>(iv) The entities listed on the FCC Form 471 application have complied with all applicable state and local laws regarding procurement of services for which support is being sought.</P>
              <P>(v) The services the school, library, or consortium purchases at discounts will be used primarily for educational purposes and will not be sold, resold, or transferred in consideration for money or any other thing of value, except as allowed by § 54.513.</P>
              <P>(vi) The entities listed in the application have complied with all program rules and acknowledge that failure to do so may result in denial of discount funding and/or recovery of funding.</P>
              <P>(vii) The applicant understands that the discount level used for shared services is conditional, for future years, upon ensuring that the most disadvantaged schools and libraries that are treated as sharing in the service, receive an appropriate share of benefits from those services.</P>
              <P>(viii) The applicant recognizes that it may be audited pursuant to its application, that it will retain for ten years any and all worksheets and other records relied upon to fill out its application, and that, if audited, it will make such records available to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(ix) Except as exempted by § 54.503(e), all bids submitted to a school, library, or consortium seeking eligible services were carefully considered and the most cost-effective bid was selected in accordance with § 54.503 of this subpart, with price being the primary factor considered, and it is the most cost-effective means of meeting educational needs and technology goals.</P>
              <P>(2) All pricing and technology infrastructure information submitted as part of an FCC Form 471 shall be treated as public and non-confidential by the Administrator unless the applicant specifies a statute, rule, or other restriction, such as a court order or an existing contract limitation barring public release of the information.</P>
              <P>(i) Contracts and other agreements executed after adoption of this rule may not prohibit disclosure of pricing or technology infrastructure information.</P>
              <P>(ii) The exemption for existing contract limitations shall not apply to voluntary extensions or renewals of existing contracts.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mixed eligibility requests.</E> If 30 percent or more of a request for discounts made in an FCC Form 471 is for ineligible services, the request shall be denied in its entirety.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rate disputes.</E> Schools, libraries, and consortia including those entities, and service providers may have recourse to the Commission, regarding interstate rates, and to state commissions, regarding intrastate rates, if they reasonably believe that the lowest corresponding price is unfairly high or low.</P>
              <P>(1) Schools, libraries, and consortia including those entities may request lower rates if the rate offered by the carrier does not represent the lowest corresponding price.</P>
              <P>(2) Service providers may request higher rates if they can show that the lowest corresponding price is not compensatory, because the relevant school, library, or consortium including those entities is not similarly situated to and subscribing to a similar set of services to the customer paying the lowest corresponding price.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Service substitution.</E> (1) The Administrator shall grant a request by an applicant to substitute a service or product for one identified on its FCC Form 471 where:</P>
              <P>(i) The service or product has the same functionality;</P>
              <P>(ii) The substitution does not violate any contract provisions or state or local procurement laws;</P>

              <P>(iii) The substitution does not result in an increase in the percentage of ineligible services or functions; and<PRTPAGE P="196"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) The applicant certifies that the requested change is within the scope of the controlling FCC Form 470, including any associated Requests for Proposal, for the original services.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that a service substitution results in a change in the pre-discount price for the supported service, support shall be based on the lower of either the pre-discount price of the service for which support was originally requested or the pre-discount price of the new, substituted service.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this rule, the two categories of eligible services are not deemed to have the same functionality as one another.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Mixed eligibility services.</E> A request for discounts for a product or service that includes both eligible and ineligible components must allocate the cost of the contract to eligible and ineligible components.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Ineligible components.</E> If a product or service contains ineligible components, costs must be allocated to the extent that a clear delineation can be made between the eligible and ineligible components. The delineation must have a tangible basis, and the price for the eligible portion must be the most cost-effective means of receiving the eligible service.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ancillary ineligible components.</E> If a product or service contains ineligible components that are ancillary to the eligible components, and the product or service is the most cost-effective means of receiving the eligible component functionality, without regard to the value of the ineligible component, costs need not be allocated between the eligible and ineligible components. Discounts shall be provided on the full cost of the product or service. An ineligible component is “ancillary” if a price for the ineligible component cannot be determined separately and independently from the price of the eligible components, and the specific package remains the most cost-effective means of receiving the eligible services, without regard to the value of the ineligible functionality.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Discounts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Discount mechanism.</E> Discounts for eligible schools and libraries shall be set as a percentage discount from the pre-discount price.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Discount percentages.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (f), the discounts available to eligible schools and libraries shall range from 20 percent to 90 percent of the pre-discount price for all eligible services provided by eligible providers, as defined in this subpart. The discounts available to a particular school, library, or consortium of only such entities shall be determined by indicators of poverty and high cost.</P>
              <P>(1) For schools and school districts, the level of poverty shall be based on the percentage of the student enrollment that is eligible for a free or reduced price lunch under the national school lunch program or a federally-approved alternative mechanism. School districts shall divide the total number of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program within the school district by the total number of students within the school district to arrive at a percentage of students eligible. This percentage rate shall then be applied to the discount matrix to set a discount rate for the supported services purchased by all schools within the school district. Independent charter schools, private schools, and other eligible educational facilities should calculate a single discount percentage rate based on the total number of students under the control of the central administrative agency.</P>
              <P>(2) For libraries and library consortia, the level of poverty shall be based on the percentage of the student enrollment that is eligible for a free or reduced price lunch under the national school lunch program or a federally-approved alternative mechanism in the public school district in which they are located and should use that school district's level of poverty to determine their discount rate when applying as a library system or as an individual library outlet within that system. When a library system has branches or outlets in more than one public school district, that library system and all library outlets within that system should use the address of the central outlet or main administrative office to determine which school district the library system is in, and should use that school district's level of poverty to determine its discount rate when applying as a library system or as one or more library outlets. If the library is not in a school district, then its level of poverty shall be based on an average of the percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch program in each of the school districts that children living in the library's location attend.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator shall classify schools and libraries as “urban” or “rural” according to the following designations.</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator shall designate a school or library as “urban” if the school or library is located in an urbanized area or urban cluster area with a population equal to or greater than 25,000, as determined by the most recent rural-urban classification by the Bureau of the Census. The Administrator shall designate all other schools and libraries as “rural.”</P>

              <P>(4) School districts, library systems, or other billed entities shall calculate discounts on supported services described in § 54.502(a) that are shared by two or more of their schools, libraries, or consortia members by calculating an average discount based on the applicable district-wide discounts of all member schools and libraries. School districts, library systems, or other billed entities shall ensure that, for each year in which an eligible school or library is included for purposes of calculating the aggregate discount rate, that eligible school or library shall receive a proportionate share of the shared services for which support is sought. For schools, the discount shall be a simple average of the applicable district-wide percentage for all schools sharing a portion of the shared services. For libraries, the average discount shall be a simple average of the applicable discounts to which the libraries sharing a portion of the shared services are entitled.<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Matrices.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, the Administrator shall use the following matrices to set discount rates to be applied to eligible category one and category two services purchased by eligible schools, school districts, libraries, or consortia based on the institution's level of poverty and location in an “urban” or “rural” area.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cap.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount of the annual cap.</E> The aggregate annual cap on federal universal service support for schools and libraries shall be $3.9 billion per funding year, of which $1 billion per funding year will be available for category two services, as described in § 54.502(a)(2), unless demand for category one services is higher than available funding.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Inflation increase.</E> In funding year 2016 and subsequent funding years, the $3.9 billion funding cap on federal universal service support for schools and libraries shall be automatically increased annually to take into account increases in the rate of inflation as calculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Increase calculation.</E> To measure increases in the rate of inflation for the purposes of this paragraph (a), the Commission shall use the Gross Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI). To compute the annual increase as required by this paragraph (a), the percentage increase in the GDP-CPI from the previous year will be used. For instance, the annual increase in the GDP-CPI from 2008 to 2009 would be used for the 2010 funding year. The increase shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent by rounding 0.05 percent and above to the next higher 0.1 percent and otherwise rounding to the next lower 0.1 percent. This percentage increase shall be added to the amount of the annual funding cap from the previous funding year. If the yearly average GDP-CPI decreases or stays the same, the annual funding cap shall remain the same as the previous year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Public notice.</E> When the calculation of the yearly average GDP-CPI is determined, the Wireline Competition Bureau shall publish a public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 60 days announcing any increase of the annual funding cap including any increase to the $1 billion funding level available for category two services based on the rate of inflation.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Filing window requests.</E> At the close of the filing window, if requests for category one services are greater than the available funding, the Administrator shall shift category two funds to provide support for category one services. If available funds are sufficient to meet demand for category one services, the Administrator, at the direction of the Wireline Competition Bureau, shall direct the remaining additional funds to provide support for category two requests.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Amount of unused funds.</E> All funds collected that are unused shall be carried forward into subsequent funding years for use in the schools and libraries support mechanism in accordance with the public interest and notwithstanding the annual cap. The Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, is delegated authority to determine the proportion of unused funds, if any, needed to meet category one demand, and to direct the Administrator to use any remaining funds to provide support for category two requests. The Administrator shall report to the Commission, on a quarterly basis, funding that is unused from prior years of the schools and libraries support mechanism.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Application of unused funds.</E> On an annual basis, in the second quarter of each calendar year, all funds that are collected and that are unused from prior years shall be available for use in the next full funding year of the schools and libraries mechanism in accordance with the public interest and notwithstanding the annual cap as described in this paragraph (a).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Funding year.</E> A funding year for purposes of the schools and libraries cap shall be the period July 1 through June 30.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests.</E> The Administrator shall implement an initial filing period that treats all schools and libraries filing an application within that period as if their applications were simultaneously received. The initial filing period shall begin and conclude on dates to be determined by the Administrator with the approval of the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau. The Administrator shall maintain on the Administrator's Web site a running tally of the funds already committed for the existing funding year. The Administrator may implement such additional filing periods as it deems necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annual filing requirement.</E> (1) Schools and libraries, and consortia of such eligible entities shall file new <PRTPAGE P="200"/>funding requests for each funding year no sooner than the July 1 prior to the start of that funding year. Schools, libraries, and eligible consortia must use recurring services for which discounts have been committed by the Administrator within the funding year for which the discounts were sought.</P>
              <P>(2) Installation of category one non-recurring services may begin on January 1 prior to the July 1 start of the funding year, provided the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Construction begins after selection of the service provider pursuant to a posted FCC Form 470,</P>
              <P>(ii) A category one recurring service must depend on the installation of the infrastructure, and</P>
              <P>(iii) The actual service start date for that recurring service is on or after the start of the funding year (July 1).</P>
              <P>(3) Installation of category two non-recurring services may begin on April 1 prior to the July 1 start of the funding year.</P>
              <P>(4) The deadline for implementation of all non-recurring services will be September 30 following the close of the funding year. An applicant may request and receive from the Administrator an extension of the implementation deadline for non-recurring services if it satisfies one of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant's funding commitment decision letter is issued by the Administrator on or after March 1 of the funding year for which discounts are authorized;</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicant receives a service provider change authorization or service substitution authorization from the Administrator on or after March 1 of the funding year for which discounts are authorized;</P>
              <P>(iii) The applicant's service provider is unable to complete implementation for reasons beyond the service provider's control; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The applicant's service provider is unwilling to complete installation because funding disbursements are delayed while the Administrator investigates the application for program compliance.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Long term contracts.</E> If schools and libraries enter into long term contracts for eligible services, the Administrator shall only commit funds to cover the pro rata portion of such a long term contract scheduled to be delivered during the funding year for which universal service support is sought.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Rules of distribution.</E> When the filing period described in paragraph (c) of this section closes, the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for both category one and category two support submitted by applicants during the filing period. If total demand for the funding year exceeds the total support available for category one or both categories, the Administrator shall take the following steps:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Category one.</E> The Administrator shall first calculate the demand for category one services for all discount levels. The Administrator shall allocate the category one funds to these requests for support, beginning with the most economically disadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by the schools and libraries discount matrix in § 54.505(c). Schools and libraries eligible for a 90 percent discount shall receive first priority for the category one funds. The Administrator shall next allocate funds toward the requests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for an 80 percent discount, then for a 70 percent discount, and shall continue committing funds for category one services in the same manner to the applicants at each descending discount level until there are no funds remaining.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Category two.</E> The Administrator shall next calculate the demand for category two services for all discount categories as determined by the schools and libraries discount matrix in § 54.505(c). If that demand exceeds the category two budget for that funding year, the Administrator shall allocate the category two funds beginning with the most economically disadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by the schools and libraries discount matrix in § 54.505(c). The Administrator shall allocate funds toward the category two requests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for an 85 percent discount first, then for a 80 percent discount, and shall continue committing funds in the same manner to the applicants at each descending <PRTPAGE P="201"/>discount level until there are no category two funds remaining.</P>
              <P>(3) To the extent that there are single discount percentage levels associated with “shared services” under § 54.505(b)(4), the Administrator shall allocate funds to the applicants at each descending discount level (e.g., 90 percent, 89 percent, then 88 percent) until there are no funds remaining.</P>
              <P>(4) For both paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, if the remaining funds are not sufficient to support all of the funding requests within a particular discount level, the Administrator shall allocate funds at that discount level using the percentage of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program. Thus, if there is not enough support to fund all requests at the 40 percent discount level, the Administrator shall allocate funds beginning with those applicants with the highest percentage of NSLP eligibility for that discount level by funding those applicants with 19 percent NSLP eligibility, then 18 percent NSLP eligibility, and shall continue committing funds in the same manner to applicants at each descending percentage of NSLP until there are no funds remaining.</P>

Promotional rates offered by a service provider for a period of more than 90 days must be included among the comparable rates upon which the lowest corresponding price is determined.</P>

              <P>An eligible school, library, or consortium must pay the non-discount portion of services or products purchased with universal service discounts. An eligible school, library, or consortium may not receive rebates for services or products purchased with universal service discounts. For the purpose of this rule, the provision, by the provider of a supported service, of free services or products unrelated to the supported service or product constitutes a rebate of the non-discount portion of the supported services.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determining the rural rate.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The rural rate shall be the average of the rates actually being charged to commercial customers, other than health care providers, for identical or similar services provided by the telecommunications carrier providing the service in the rural area in which the health care provider is located. The rates included in this average shall be for services provided over the same distance as the eligible service. The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate must not include any rates reduced by universal service support mechanisms. The “rural rate” shall be used as described in this subpart to determine the credit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications carrier that provides eligible telecommunications services to eligible health care providers.</P>
                <P>(b) If the telecommunications carrier serving the health care provider is not providing any identical or similar services in the rural area, then the rural rate shall be the average of the tariffed and other publicly available rates, not including any rates reduced by universal service programs, charged for the same or similar services in that rural area over the same distance as the eligible service by other carriers. If there are no tariffed or publicly available rates for such services in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably determines that this method for calculating the rural rate is unfair, then the carrier shall submit for the state commission's approval, for intrastate rates, or the Commission's approval, for interstate rates, a cost-based rate for the provision of the service in the most economically efficient, reasonably available manner.</P>
                <P>(1) The carrier must provide, to the state commission, or intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for interstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, including an itemization of the costs of providing the requested service.</P>
                <P>(2) The carrier must provide such information periodically thereafter as required, by the state commission for intrastate rates or the Commission for interstate rates. In doing so, the carrier must take into account anticipated and actual demand for telecommunications services by all customers who will use the facilities over which services are being provided to eligible health care providers.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Calculating support.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The amount of universal service support provided for an eligible service to be funded from the Telecommunications Program shall be the difference, if any, between the urban rate and the rural rate charged for the service, as defined herein. In addition, all reasonable charges that are incurred by taking such services, such as state and federal taxes shall be eligible for universal service support. Charges for termination liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges not included in the cost of taking such service shall not be covered by the universal service support mechanisms. Under the Telecommunications Program, rural health care providers may choose one of the following two support options.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Distance based support.</E> The Administrator shall consider the base rates for telecommunications services in <PRTPAGE P="212"/>rural areas to be reasonably comparable to the base rates charged for functionally similar telecommunications service in urban areas in that state, and, therefore, the Administrator shall not include these charges in calculating the support. The Administrator shall include, in the support calculation, all other charges specified, and all actual distance-based charges as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If the requested service distance is less than or equal to the SUD for the state, the distance-based charges for the rural health care provider are reasonably comparable to those in urban areas, so the health care provider will not receive distance-based support.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the requested service distance is greater than the SUD for the state, but less than the maximum allowable distance, the distance-based charge actually incurred for that service can be no higher than the distance-based charges for a functionally similar service in any city in that state with a population of 50,000 or more over the SUD.</P>
                <P>(iii) “Distance-based charges” are charges based on a unit of distance, such as mileage-based charges.</P>
                <P>(iv) A telecommunications carrier that provides telecommunications service to a rural health care provider participating in an eligible health care consortium, and the consortium must establish the actual distance-based charges for the health care provider's portion of the shared telecommunications services.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Base rate support.</E> If a telecommunications carrier, health care provider, and/or consortium of health care providers reasonably determines that the base rates for telecommunications services in rural areas are not reasonably comparable to the base rates charged for functionally similar telecommunications service in urban areas in that state, the telecommunications carrier, health care provider, and/or consortium of health care providers may request that the Administrator perform a more comprehensive support calculation. The requester shall provide to the Administrator the information to establish both the urban and rural rates consistent with § 54.605 and § 54.607, and submit to the Administrator with Form 466 all of the documentation necessary to substantiate the request.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Base rate support-consortium.</E> A telecommunications carrier that provides telecommunications service to a rural health care provider participating in an eligible health care consortium, and the consortium must establish the applicable rural base rates for telecommunications service for the health care provider's portion of the shared telecommunications services, as well as the applicable urban base rates for the telecommunications service.</P>
                <P>(b) Absent documentation justifying the amount of universal service support requested for health care providers participating in a consortium, the Administrator shall not allow telecommunications carriers to offset, or receive reimbursement for, the amount eligible for universal service support.</P>
                <P>(c) The universal service support mechanisms shall provide support for intrastate telecommunications services, as set forth in § 54.101(a), provided to rural health care providers as well as interstate telecommunications services.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Satellite services.</E> (1) Rural public and non-profit health care providers may receive support for rural satellite services under the Telecommunications Program, even when another functionally similar terrestrial-based service is available in that rural area. Support for satellite services shall be capped at the amount the rural health care provider would have received if they purchased a functionally similar terrestrial-based alternative.</P>
                <P>(2) Rural health care providers seeking support from the Telecommunications Program for satellite services shall provide to the Administrator with the Form 466, documentation of the urban and rural rates for the terrestrial-based alternatives.</P>
                <P>(3) Where a rural health care provider seeks a more expensive satellite-based service when a less expensive terrestrial-based alternative is available, the rural health care provider shall be responsible for the additional cost.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Mobile rural health care providers</E>— (1) <E T="03">Calculation of support.</E> The support amount allowed under the Telecommunications Program for satellite services provided to mobile rural <PRTPAGE P="213"/>health care providers is calculated by comparing the rate for the satellite service to the rate for an urban wireline service with a similar bandwidth. Support for satellite services shall not be capped at an amount of a functionally similar wireline alternative. Where the mobile rural health care provider provides service in more than one state, the calculation shall be based on the urban areas in each state, proportional to the number of locations served in each state.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Documentation of support.</E> (i) Mobile rural health care providers shall provide to the Administrator documentation of the price of bandwidth equivalent wireline services in the urban area in the state or states where the service is provided. Mobile rural health care providers shall provide to the Administrator the number of sites the mobile health care provider will serve during the funding year.</P>
                <P>(ii) Where a mobile rural health care provider serves less than eight different sites per year, the mobile rural health care provider shall provide to the Administrator documentation of the price of bandwidth equivalent wireline services. In such case, the Administrator shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the telecommunications service selected by the mobile rural health care provider is the most cost-effective option. Where a mobile rural health care provider seeks a more expensive satellite-based service when a less expensive wireline alternative is most cost-effective, the mobile rural health care provider shall be responsible for the additional cost.</P>

For purposes of the Healthcare Connect Fund, a “consortium” is a group of two or more health care provider sites that request support through a single application. Consortia may include health care providers who are not eligible for support under the Healthcare Connect Fund, but such health care providers cannot receive support for their expenses and must participate pursuant to the cost allocation guidelines in § 54.639(d).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Identifying a Consortium Leader.</E> Each consortium seeking support from the Healthcare Connect Fund must identify an entity or organization that will be the lead entity (the “Consortium Leader”).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Consortium Leader eligibility.</E> The Consortium Leader may be the consortium itself (if it is a distinct legal entity); an eligible health care provider participating in the consortium; or a state organization, public sector (governmental) entity (including a Tribal government entity), or non-profit entity that is ineligible for Healthcare Connect Fund support. Ineligible state organizations, public sector entities, or non-profit entities may serve as Consortium Leaders or provide consulting assistance to consortia only if they do not participate as potential vendors during the competitive bidding process. An ineligible entity that serves as the Consortium Leader must pass on the full value of any discounts, funding, or other program benefits secured to the consortium members that are eligible health care providers.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Consortium Leader responsibilities.</E> The Consortium Leader's responsibilities include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Legal and financial responsibility for supported activities.</E> The Consortium Leader is the legally and financially responsible entity for the activities supported by the Healthcare Connect Fund. By default, the Consortium Leader is the responsible entity if audits or other investigations by Administrator or the Commission reveal violations of the Act or Commission rules, with individual consortium members being jointly and severally liable if the Consortium Leader dissolves, files for bankruptcy, or otherwise fails to meet its obligations. Except for the responsibilities specifically described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(6) of this section, consortia may allocate legal and financial responsibility as they see fit, provided that this allocation is memorialized in a formal written agreement between the affected parties (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the Consortium Leader, and the consortium as a whole and/or its individual members), and the written agreement is submitted to the Administrator for approval with or prior to the Request for Services. Any such agreement must <PRTPAGE P="216"/>clearly identify the party(ies) responsible for repayment if the Administrator is required, at a later date, to recover disbursements to the consortium due to violations of program rules.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Point of contact for the FCC and Administrator.</E> The Consortium Leader is responsible for designating an individual who will be the “Project Coordinator” and serve as the point of contact with the Commission and the Administrator for all matters related to the consortium. The Consortium Leader is responsible for responding to Commission and Administrator inquiries on behalf of the consortium members throughout the application, funding, invoicing, and post-invoicing period.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Typical applicant functions, including forms and certifications.</E> The Consortium Leader is responsible for submitting program forms and required documentation and ensuring that all information and certifications submitted are true and correct. The Consortium Leader must also collect and retain a Letter of Agency (LOA) from each member, pursuant to § 54.632.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Competitive bidding and cost allocation.</E> The Consortium Leader is responsible for ensuring that the competitive bidding process is fair and open and otherwise complies with Commission requirements. If costs are shared by both eligible and ineligible entities, the Consortium Leader must ensure that costs are allocated in a manner that ensures that only eligible entities receive the benefit of program discounts.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Invoicing.</E> The Consortium Leader is responsible for notifying the Administrator when supported services have commenced and for submitting invoices to the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Recordkeeping, site visits, and audits.</E> The Consortium Leader is also responsible for compliance with the Commission's recordkeeping requirements and for coordinating site visits and audits for all consortium members.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Future revenues from excess capacity as source of health care provider contribution.</E> A consortium applicant that receives support for participant-owned network facilities under § 54.636 may use future revenues from excess capacity as a source for the required health care provider contribution, subject to the following limitations.</P>
                <P>(1) The consortium's selection criteria and evaluation for “cost-effectiveness” pursuant to § 54.642 cannot provide a preference to bidders that offer to construct excess capacity.</P>
                <P>(2) The applicant must pay the full amount of the additional costs for excess capacity facilities that will not be part of the supported health care network.</P>
                <P>(3) The additional cost of constructing excess capacity facilities may not count toward a health care provider's required contribution.</P>
                <P>(4) The inclusion of excess capacity facilities cannot increase the funded cost of the dedicated health care network in any way.</P>
                <P>(5) An eligible health care provider (typically the consortium, although it may be an individual health care provider participating in the consortium) must retain ownership of the excess capacity facilities. It may make the facilities available to third parties only under an indefeasible right of use (IRU) or lease arrangement. The lease or IRU between the participant and the third party must be an arm's length transaction. To ensure that this is an arm's length transaction, neither the vendor that installs the excess capacity facilities nor its affiliate is eligible to enter into an IRU or lease with the participant.</P>
                <P>(6) Any amount prepaid for use of the excess capacity facilities (IRU or lease) must be placed in an escrow account. The participant can then use the escrow account as an eligible source of funds for the participant's 35 percent contribution to the project.</P>
                <P>(7) All revenues from use of the excess capacity facilities by the third party must be used for the health care provider contribution or for sustainability of the health care network supported by the Healthcare Connect Fund. Network costs that may be funded with any additional revenues that remain include administration, equipment, software, legal fees, or other costs not covered by the Healthcare Connect Fund, as long as they are relevant to sustaining the network.</P>

                <P>(1) Support for recurring charges associated with dark fiber is only available once the dark fiber is “lit” and actually being used by the health care provider. Support for non-recurring charges for dark fiber is only available for fiber lit within the same funding year, but applicants may receive up to a one-year extension to light fiber if they provide documentation to the Administrator that construction was unavoidably delayed due to weather or other reasons.</P>
                <P>(2) Requests for proposals (RFPs) that solicit dark fiber solutions must also solicit proposals to provide the needed services over lit fiber over a time period comparable to the duration of the dark fiber lease or indefeasible right of use.</P>
                <P>(3) If an applicant intends to request support for equipment and maintenance costs associated with lighting and operating dark fiber, it must include such elements in the same RFP as the dark fiber so that the Administrator can review all costs associated with the fiber when determining whether the applicant chose the most cost-effective bid.</P>

                  <P>1. Personnel costs (including salaries and fringe benefits), except for personnel expenses in a consortium application that directly relate to designing, engineering, installing, constructing, and managing a dedicated broadband network. Ineligible costs of this category include, for example, personnel to perform program management and coordination, program administration, and marketing;</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Cost allocation for ineligible sites, services, or equipment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Ineligible sites.</E> Eligible health care provider sites may share expenses with ineligible sites, as <PRTPAGE P="221"/>long as the ineligible sites pay their fair share of the expenses. An applicant may seek support for only the portion of a shared eligible expense attributable to eligible health care provider sites. To receive support, the applicant must ensure that ineligible sites pay their fair share of the expense. The fair share is determined as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If the vendor charges a separate and independent price for each site, an ineligible site must pay the full undiscounted price.</P>
                <P>(ii) If there is no separate and independent price for each site, the applicant must prorate the undiscounted price for the “shared” service, equipment, or facility between eligible and ineligible sites on a proportional fully-distributed basis. Applicants must make this cost allocation using a method that is based on objective criteria and reasonably reflects the eligible usage of the shared service, equipment, or facility. The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the allocation method chosen.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Ineligible components of a single service or piece of equipment.</E> Applicants seeking support for a service or piece of equipment that includes an ineligible component must explicitly request in their requests for proposals that vendors include pricing for a comparable service or piece of equipment that is comprised of only eligible components. If the selected provider also submits a price for the eligible component on a stand-alone basis, the support amount is calculated based on the stand-alone price of the eligible component on a stand-alone basis. If the vendor does not offer the eligible component on a stand-alone basis, the full price of the entire service or piece of equipment must be taken into account, without regard to the value of the ineligible components, when determining the most cost-effective bid.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Written description.</E> Applicants must submit a written description of their allocation method(s) to the Administrator with their funding requests.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Written agreement.</E> If ineligible entities participate in a network, the allocation method must be memorialized in writing, such as a formal agreement among network members, a master services contract, or for smaller consortia, a letter signed and dated by all (or each) ineligible entity and the Consortium Leader.</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Request for funding.</E> The applicant shall submit a request for funding (Form 462) to identify the service(s), equipment, or facilities; rates; vendor(s); and date(s) of vendor selection.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Certifications.</E> The applicant must provide the following certifications as part of the request for funding:</P>
                <P>(i) The person signing the application is authorized to submit the application on behalf of the applicant and has examined the form and all attachments, and to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief, all statements of fact contained therein are true.</P>
                <P>(ii) Each vendor selected is, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, information and belief, the most cost-effective vendor available, as defined in § 54.642(c).</P>
                <P>(iii) All Healthcare Connect Fund support will be used only for eligible health care purposes.</P>
                <P>(iv) The applicant is not requesting support for the same service from both the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund.</P>

                <P>(v) The applicant satisfies all of the requirements under section 254 of the Act and applicable Commission rules, <PRTPAGE P="225"/>and understands that any letter from the Administrator that erroneously commits funds for the benefit of the applicant may be subject to rescission.</P>

Applicants may incorporate by reference other portions of their applications (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> project management plan, budget). The sustainability plan must, at a minimum, address the following points:</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Projected sustainability period.</E> Indicate the sustainability period, which at a minimum is equal to the useful life of the funded facility. The consortium's budget must show projected income and expenses (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> for maintenance) for the project at the aggregate level, for the sustainability period.<PRTPAGE P="226"/>
                </P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Principal factors.</E> Discuss each of the principal factors that were considered by the participant to demonstrate sustainability. This discussion must include all factors that show that the proposed network will be sustainable for the entire sustainability period. Any factor that will have a monetary impact on the network must be reflected in the applicant's budget.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Terms of membership in the network.</E> Describe generally any agreements made (or to be entered into) by network members (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> participation agreements, memoranda of understanding, usage agreements, or other similar agreements). The sustainability plan must also describe, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Financial and time commitments made by proposed members of the network;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the project includes excess bandwidth for growth of the network, describe how such excess bandwidth will be financed; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the network will include ineligible health care providers and other network members, describe how fees for joining and using the network will be assessed.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Ownership structure.</E> Explain who will own each material element of the network (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> fiber constructed, network equipment, end user equipment). For purposes of this subsection, “ownership” includes an indefeasible right of use interest. Applicants must clearly identify the legal entity that will own each material element. Applicants must also describe any arrangements made to ensure continued use of such elements by the network members for the duration of the sustainability period.</P>
                <P>(E) <E T="03">Sources of future support.</E> Describe other sources of future funding, including fees to be paid by eligible health care providers and/or non-eligible entities.</P>
                <P>(F) <E T="03">Management.</E> Describe the management structure of the network for the duration of the sustainability period. The applicant's budget must describe how management costs will be funded.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Material change to sustainability plan.</E> A consortium that is required to file a sustainability plan must maintain its accuracy. If there is a material change to a required sustainability plan that would impact projected income or expenses by more than 20 percent or $100,000 from the previous submission, or if the applicant submits a funding request based on a new Form 462 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a new competitively bid contract), the consortium is required to re-file its sustainability plan. In the event of a material change, the applicant must provide the Administrator with the revised sustainability plan no later than the end of the relevant quarter, clearly showing (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by redlining or highlighting) what has changed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Cap.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount of the annual cap.</E> The aggregate annual cap on federal universal service support for health care providers shall be $571 million per funding year, of which up to $150 million per funding year will be available to support upfront payments and multi-year commitments under the Healthcare Connect Fund.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Inflation increase.</E> In funding year 2018 and the subsequent funding years, the $571 million cap on federal universal support in the Rural Health Care Program shall be automatically increased annually to take into account increases in the rate of inflation as calculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Increase calculation.</E> To measure increases in the rate of inflation for the purposes of this paragraph (a), the Commission shall use the Gross Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI). To compute the annual increase as required by this paragraph (a), the percentage increase in the GDP-CPI from the previous year will be used. For instance, the annual increase in the GDP-CPI from 2017 to 2018 would be used for the 2018 funding year. The increase shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent by rounding 0.05 percent and above to the next higher 0.1 percent and otherwise rounding to the next lower 0.1 percent. This percentage increase shall be added to the amount of the annual funding cap from the previous funding year. If the yearly average GDP-CPI decreases or stays the same, the annual funding cap shall remain the same as the previous year.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Public notice.</E> When the calculation of the yearly average GDP-CPI is determined, the Wireline Competition Bureau shall publish a public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 60 days announcing any increase of the annual funding cap based on the rate of inflation.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Amount of unused funds.</E> All funds collected that are unused shall be carried forward into subsequent funding years for use in the Rural Health Care Program in accordance with the public interest and notwithstanding the annual cap. The Administrator shall report to the Commission, on a quarterly basis, funding that is unused from prior years of the Rural Health Care Program.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Application of unused funds.</E> On an annual basis, in the second quarter of each calendar year, all funds that are collected and that are unused from prior years shall be available for use in the next full funding year of the Rural Health Care Program in accordance with the public interest and notwithstanding the annual cap as described in this paragraph (a).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Funding year.</E> A funding year for purposes of the health care providers <PRTPAGE P="229"/>cap shall be the period July 1 through June 30.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests.</E> Funds shall be available as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Generally, funds shall be available to eligible health care providers on a first-come-first-served basis, with requests accepted beginning on the first of January prior to each funding year.</P>
                <P>(2) For the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund, the Administrator shall implement a filing window period that treats all eligible health care providers filing within the window period as if their applications were simultaneously received.</P>
                <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(4) The deadline to submit a funding commitment request under the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund is June 30 for the funding year that begins on the previous July 1.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Annual filing requirement.</E> Health care providers shall file new funding requests for each funding year, except for health care providers who have received a multi-year funding commitment under § 54.644.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Long-term contracts.</E> If health care providers enter into long-term contracts for eligible services, the Administrator shall only commit funds to cover the portion of such a long-term contract scheduled to be delivered during the funding year for which universal service support is sought, except for multi-year funding commitments as described in § 54.644.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Pro-rata reductions for Telecommunications Program support.</E> The Administrator shall act in accordance with this section when a filing window period for the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is in effect. When a filing window period described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section closes, the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support submitted by all applicants during the filing window period. If the total demand during a filing window period exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, the Administrator shall take the following steps:</P>
                <P>(1) The Administrator shall divide the total remaining funds available for the funding year by the total amount of Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support requested by each applicant that has filed during the window period, to produce a pro-rata factor.</P>
                <P>(2) The Administrator shall calculate the amount of Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support requested by each applicant that has filed during the filing window.</P>
                <P>(3) The Administrator shall multiply the pro-rata factor by the total dollar amount requested by each applicant filing during the window period. Administrator shall then commit funds to each applicant for Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support consistent with this calculation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Election to offset support against annual universal service fund contribution.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A service provider that contributes to the universal service support mechanisms under subpart H of this part and also provides services eligible for support under this subpart to eligible health care providers may, at the election of the contributor:</P>
                <P>(1) Treat the amount eligible for support under this subpart as an offset against the contributor's universal service support obligation for the year in which the costs for providing eligible services were incurred; or</P>
                <P>(2) Receive direct reimbursement from the Administrator for that amount.</P>

                <P>(b) Service providers that are contributors shall elect in January of each year the method by which they will be reimbursed and shall remain subject to that method for the duration of the calendar year. Any support amount that is owed a service provider that fails to remit its monthly universal service contribution obligation, however, shall first be applied as an offset to that contributor's contribution obligation. Such a service provider shall <PRTPAGE P="230"/>remain subject to the offsetting method for the remainder of the calendar year in which it failed to remit its monthly universal service obligation. A service provider that continues to be in arrears on its universal service contribution obligations at the end of a calendar year shall remain subject to the offsetting method for the next calendar year.</P>

              <P>(a) Prior to April 1, 2003, contributions to the universal service support mechanisms shall be based on contributors' end-user telecommunications revenues and on a contribution factor determined quarterly by the Commission. Contributions to the mechanisms beginning April 1, 2003 shall be based on contributors' projected collected end-user telecommunications revenues, and on a contribution factor determined quarterly by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(1) For funding the federal universal service support mechanisms prior to April 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contributors' interstate and international revenues derived from domestic end users for telecommunications or telecommunications services, net of prior period actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contributors' projected collected interstate and international revenues derived from domestic end users for telecommunications or telecommunications services, net of projected contributions.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal service contribution factor shall be determined by the Commission based on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses of the universal service support mechanisms to the total end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenues, net of prior period actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal service contribution factor shall be determined by the Commission based on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses of the universal service support mechanisms to the total projected collected end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenues, net of projected contributions. The Commission shall approve the Administrator's quarterly projected costs of the universal service support mechanisms, taking into account demand for support and administrative expenses. The total subject revenues shall be compiled by the Administrator based on information contained in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets described in § 54.711(a).</P>

              <P>(3) Total projected expenses for the federal universal service support mechanisms for each quarter must be approved by the Commission before they are used to calculate the quarterly contribution factor and individual contributions. For each quarter, the Administrator must submit its projections of demand for the federal universal service support mechanisms for high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers, respectively, and the basis for those projections, to the Commission and the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. For each quarter, the Administrator must submit its projections of administrative expenses for the high-cost mechanism, the low-income mechanism, the schools and libraries mechanism and the rural health care mechanism and the basis for those projections to the Commission and the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. Based on data submitted to the Administrator on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets, the Administrator must submit the total contribution base to the Office of the Managing Director at least thirty (30) days before the start of each quarter. The projections of demand and <PRTPAGE P="238"/>administrative expenses and the contribution factor shall be announced by the Commission in a public notice and shall be made available on the Commission's website. The Commission reserves the right to set projections of demand and administrative expenses at amounts that the Commission determines will serve the public interest at any time within the fourteen-day period following release of the Commission's public notice. If the Commission take no action within fourteen (14) days of the date of release of the public notice announcing the projections of demand and administrative expenses, the projections of demand and administrative expenses, and the contribution factor shall be deemed approved by the Commission. Except as provided in § 54.706(c), the Administrator shall apply the quarterly contribution factor, once approved by the Commission, to contributor's interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues to calculate the amount of individual contributions.</P>
              <P>(b) If the contributions received by the Administrator in a quarter exceed the amount of universal service support program contributions and administrative costs for that quarter, the excess payments will be carried forward to the following quarter. The contribution factors for the following quarter will take into consideration the projected costs of the support mechanisms for that quarter and the excess contributions carried over from the previous quarter. The Commission may instruct the Administrator to treat excess contributions in a manner other than as prescribed in this paragraph (b). Such instructions may be made in the form of a Commission Order or a public notice released by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Any such public notice will become effective fourteen days after release of the public notice, absent further Commission action.</P>
              <P>(c) If the contributions received by the Administrator in a quarter are inadequate to meet the amount of universal service support program payments and administrative costs for that quarter, the Administrator shall request authority from the Commission to borrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by future contributions. Subsequent contribution factors will take into consideration the projected costs of the support mechanisms and the additional costs associated with borrowing funds.</P>
              <P>(d) If a contributor fails to file a Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet by the date on which it is due, the Administrator shall bill that contributor based on whatever relevant data the Administrator has available, including, but not limited to, the number of lines presubscribed to the contributor and data from previous years, taking into consideration any estimated changes in such data.</P>

              <P>(a) Contributions shall be calculated and filed in accordance with the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet which shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet sets forth information that the contributor must submit to the Administrator on a quarterly and annual basis. The Commission shall announce by Public Notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on its website the manner of payment and dates by which payments must be made. An executive officer of the contributor must certify to the truth and accuracy of historical data included in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet, and that any projections in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet represent a good-faith estimate based on the contributor's policies and procedures. The Commission or the Administrator may verify any information contained in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet. Contributors shall maintain records and documentation to justify information reported in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet, including the methodology used to determine projections, for three years <PRTPAGE P="239"/>and shall provide such records and documentation to the Commission or the Administrator upon request. Inaccurate or untruthful information contained in the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet may lead to prosecution under the criminal provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code. The Administrator shall advise the Commission of any enforcement issues that arise and provide any suggested response.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commission shall have access to all data reported to the Administrator. Contributors may make requests for Commission nondisclosure of company-specific revenue information under § 0.459 of this chapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data are submitted. The Commission shall make all decisions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific information. The Administrator shall keep confidential all data obtained from contributors, shall not use such data except for purposes of administering the universal service support programs, and shall not disclose such data in company-specific form unless directed to do so by the Commission. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau, the Universal Service Administrator may share data obtained from contributors with the administrators of the North American Numbering Plan administration cost recovery (See 47 CFR 52.16 of this chapter), the local number portability cost recovery (See 47 CFR 52.32 of this chapter), and the TRS Fund (See 47 CFR 64.604(c)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter). The Administrator shall keep confidential all data obtained from other administrators and shall not use such data except for purposes of administering the universal service support mechanisms.</P>

              <P>(a) A contributor that fails to file a Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet and subsequently is billed by the Administrator shall pay the amount for which it is billed. The Administrator may bill a contributor a separate assessment for reasonable costs incurred because of that contributor's filing of an untruthful or inaccurate Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet, failure to file the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet, or late payment of contributions. Failure to file the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet or to submit required quarterly contributions may subject the contributor to the enforcement provisions of the Act and any other applicable law. The Administrator shall advise the Commission of any enforcement issues that arise and provide any suggested response. Once a contributor complies with the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet filing requirements, the Administrator may refund any overpayments made by the contributor, less any fees, interest, or costs.</P>

              <P>(b) If a universal service fund contributor fails to make full payment on or before the date due of the monthly amount established by the contributor's applicable Form 499-A or Form 499-Q, or the monthly invoice provided by the Administrator, the payment is delinquent. All such delinquent amounts shall incur from the date of delinquency, and until all charges and <PRTPAGE P="240"/>costs are paid in full, interest at the rate equal to the U.S. prime rate (in effect on the date of the delinquency) plus 3.5 percent, as well as administrative charges of collection and/or penalties and charges permitted by the applicable law (e.g., 31 U.S.C. 3717 and implementing regulations).</P>
              <P>(c) If a universal service fund contributor is more than 30 days delinquent in filing a Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet Form 499-A or 499-Q, the Administrator shall assess an administrative remedial collection charge equal to the greater of $100 or an amount computed using the rate of the U.S. prime rate (in effect on the date the applicable Worksheet is due) plus 3.5 percent, of the amount due per the Administrator's calculations. In addition, the contributor is responsible for administrative charges of collection and/or penalties and charges permitted by the applicable law (e.g., 31 U.S.C. 3717 and implementing regulations). The Commission may also pursue enforcement action against delinquent contributors and late filers, and assess costs for collection activities in addition to those imposed by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(d) In the event a contributor fails both to file the Worksheet and to pay its contribution, interest will accrue on the greater of the amounts due, beginning with the earlier of the date of the failure to file or pay.</P>
              <P>(e) If a universal service fund contributor pays the Administrator a sum that is less than the amount due for the contributor's universal service contribution, the Administrator shall adhere to the “American Rule” whereby payment is applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, next to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal. In applying the payment to outstanding principal, the Administrator shall apply such payment to the contributor's oldest past due amounts first.</P>

              <P>(iv) Any non-United States bank:</P>

              <P>(A) That is among the 100 largest non-U.S. banks in the world, determined on the basis of total assets as of <PRTPAGE P="247"/>the end of the calendar year immediately preceding the issuance of the letter of credit (determined on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis as of such date);</P>

              <P>(4) Authorization to receive Remote Areas Fund support is conditioned upon full and timely performance of all of the requirements set forth in this section, and any additional terms and conditions upon which the support was granted.</P>
              <P>(i) Failure by a Remote Areas Fund support recipient to meet its service milestones as required by § 54.310 will trigger reporting obligations and the withholding of support as described in § 54.320(c). Failure to come into full compliance within 12 months will trigger a recovery action by the Universal Service Administrative Company. If the Remote Areas Fund recipient does not repay the requisite amount of support within six months, the Universal Service Administrative Company will be entitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of credit and may disqualify the Remote Areas Fund support recipient from the receipt of Remote Areas Fund support or additional universal service support.</P>
              <P>(ii) The default will be evidenced by a letter issued by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau or the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, or their respective designees, which letter, attached to a standby letter of credit draw certificate, shall be sufficient for a draw on the standby letter of credit for the entire amount of the standby letter of credit.</P>

              <P>(a) To be eligible for CAF BLS, each rate-of-return carrier shall make the following filings with the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(1) Each rate-of-return carrier shall submit to the Administrator on March 31 of each year the number of lines it served as of the prior December 31, within each rate-of-return carrier study area showing residential and single-line business line counts, multi-line business line counts, and consumer broadband-only line counts separately.For purposes of this report, and for purposes of computing support under this subpart, the residential and single-line business class lines reported include lines assessed the residential and single-line business End User Common Line charge pursuant to § 69.104 of this chapter, the multi-line business class lines reported include lines assessed the multi-line business End User Common Line charge pursuant to § 69.104 of this chapter, and consumer broadband-only lines reported include lines assessed the Consumer Broadband-only Loop rate charged pursuant to § 69.132 of this chapter or provided on a detariffed basis. For purposes of this report, and for purposes of computing support under this subpart, lines served using resale of the rate-of-return local exchange carrier's service pursuant to section 251(c)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall be considered lines served by the rate-of-return carrier only and must be reported accordingly.</P>
              <P>(2) A rate-of-return carrier may submit the information in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the schedule in § 54.1306, even if it is not required to do so. If a rate-of-return carrier makes a filing under this paragraph, it shall separately indicate any lines that it has acquired from another carrier that it has not previously reported pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, identified by customer class and the carrier from which the lines were acquired.</P>

              <P>(3) Each rate-of-return carrier shall submit to the Administrator annually by March 31 projected data necessary to calculate the carrier's prospective CAF BLS, including common line and consumer broadband-only loop cost and revenue data, for each of its study areas in the upcoming funding year. The funding year shall be July 1 of the current year through June 30 of the next year. The data shall be accompanied by a certification that the cost data is compliant with the Commission's cost allocation rules and does not reflect duplicative assignment of <PRTPAGE P="250"/>costs to the consumer broadband-only loop and special access categories.</P>
              <P>(4) Each rate-of-return carrier shall submit to the Administrator on December 31 of each year the data necessary to calculate a carrier's Connect America Fund CAF BLS, including common line and consumer broadband-only loop cost and revenue data, for the prior calendar year. Such data shall be used by the Administrator to make adjustments to monthly per-line CAF BLS amounts to the extent of any differences between the carrier's CAF BLS received based on projected common line cost and revenue data, and the CAF BLS for which the carrier is ultimately eligible based on its actual common line and consumer broadband-only loop cost and revenue data during the relevant period. The data shall be accompanied by a certification that the cost data is compliant with the Commission's cost allocation rules and does not reflect duplicative assignment of costs to the consumer broadband-only loop and special access categories.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon receiving the information required to be filed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Perform the calculations described in § 54.901 and distribute support accordingly;</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) Perform periodic reconciliation of the CAF BLS provided to each carrier based on projected data filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section and the CAF BLS for which each carrier is eligible based on actual data filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(4) Report quarterly to the Commission on the collection and distribution of funds under this subpart as described in § 54.702(h). Fund distribution reporting will be by state and by eligible telecommunications carrier within the state.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance for Mobility Fund Phase II.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Mobile eligible telecommunications carriers subject to defined build-out milestones in § 54.1015 must notify the Commission and USAC, and the relevant state, U.S. Territory, or Tribal government, if applicable, within ten (10) business days after the applicable deadline if they have failed to meet a build-out milestone.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Interim build-out milestones.</E> Upon notification that a mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has defaulted on an interim build-out milestone after it has begun receiving Mobility Fund Phase II support, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter evidencing the default. For purposes of determining whether a default has occurred, any service a mobile eligible telecommunications carrier offers must meet the performance obligations in § 54.1015(a)(1) and (2). The issuance of this letter shall initiate reporting obligations and withholding of a percentage of the mobile eligible telecommunication carrier's total monthly Mobility Fund Phase II support, if applicable, starting the month following the issuance of the letter:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Tier 1.</E> If a mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of at least five (5) percent but less than 15 percent of the eligible square miles that the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have covered by the relevant interim milestone at the state level, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect. Starting three (3) months after the issuance of this letter, the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file a report every three (3) months identifying the eligible square miles to which the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has newly deployed facilities capable of meeting the <PRTPAGE P="262"/>requisite Mobility Fund Phase II requirements at the state level in the previous quarter. Mobile eligible telecommunications carriers that do not file these quarterly reports on time will be subject to support reductions as specified in § 54.1019(f). The mobile eligible telecommunications carrier must continue to file quarterly reports until the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier reports that it has reduced the compliance gap to less than five (5) percent of the eligible square miles for that interim milestone at the state level and the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issues a letter to that effect.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tier 2.</E> If a mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of at least 15 percent but less than 25 percent of the eligible square miles that the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have covered by the interim milestone at the state level, USAC will withhold 15 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for that state and the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file quarterly reports. Once the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has reported that it has reduced the compliance gap to less than 15 percent of the eligible square miles for that interim milestone at the state level, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect, and the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will then move to Tier 1 status.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tier 3.</E> If a mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of at least 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the eligible square miles that the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have covered by the interim milestone at the state level, USAC will withhold 25 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for that state and the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file quarterly reports. Once the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has reported that it has reduced the compliance gap to less than 25 percent of the eligible square miles for that interim milestone at the state level, the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect, and the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will move to Tier 2 status.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Tier 4.</E> If a mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has a compliance gap of 50 percent or more of the eligible square miles that the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier is required to have covered by the interim milestone at the state level:</P>
              <P>(A) USAC will withhold 50 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for that state, and the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will be required to file quarterly reports. As with the other tiers, as the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier reports that it has lessened the extent of its non-compliance, and the Wireline Competition Bureau or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issues a letter to that effect, it will move down the tiers until it reaches Tier 1 (or no longer is out of compliance with the relevant interim milestone).</P>
              <P>(B) If, after having 50 percent of its support withheld for six (6) months, the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has not reported that it has a compliance gap of less than 50 percent, USAC will withhold 100 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's monthly support for the state and will commence a recovery action for a percentage of support that is equal to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's compliance gap plus 10 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's support that has been disbursed to that date.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Restoration of full support.</E> If at any point during the support term, the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier reports that it is eligible for Tier 1 status, it will have its support fully restored, USAC will repay any funds that were recovered or withheld, and it will move to Tier 1 status.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Final milestone.</E> Upon notification that the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has not met a final milestone, the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will have <PRTPAGE P="263"/>twelve (12) months from the date of the final milestone deadline to come into full compliance with this milestone.</P>

              <P>(i) If the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier does not report that it has come into full compliance with this milestone within twelve (12) months because it fails to meet the 85 percent benchmark (even if it meets the 75 percent benchmark for some or all the census block group(s) or census tract(s)), the Wireline Competition Bureau or the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter, and USAC will recover disbursement(s) in an amount of support that is equal to 1.89 multiplied by the average amount of support the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier received per eligible square mile in the state over the six year period multiplied by the number of square miles unserved in the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's winning areas in the state that would be required to meet the 85 percent benchmark, plus 10 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's total Mobility Fund Phase II support received in the state over the six-year period for deployment. After the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has paid the calculated recovery amount for failure to comply with the final deployment milestone, the Bureaus will calculate a reduced support payment for the remaining support term based on the percentage of deployment coverage completed. The reduced ongoing annual support amount will be the total of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's original winning bid amounts for annual support in the state multiplied by the sum of the actual deployment percentage plus 15 percent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the difference between 100 percent coverage and the required 85 percent minimum coverage), or (annual support) * (percentage covered + 0.15). If at the end of six months the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has not fully paid back the support for missing the relevant 85 percent benchmark, the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier shall be liable for repayment of all the support that has been disbursed to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier for that state, the Wireline Competition Bureau or the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect, and USAC will draw on the letter(s) of credit to recover all the support that has been disbursed to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier for that state.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier does not report that it has come into full compliance with this milestone within twelve (12) months because it fails to meet the 75 percent benchmark(s) for any census block group(s) or census tract(s) in the state at the final milestone (even if it meets the 85 percent statewide benchmark), the Wireline Competition Bureau or the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter for any such census block group(s) or census tract(s), and USAC will recover disbursement(s) in an amount of support that is equal to 1.89 multiplied by the average amount of support the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier received per eligible square mile in the census block group(s) or census tract(s) in the state over the six year period multiplied by the number of square miles unserved in each of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's winning census block group(s) or census tract(s) in the state that would be required to meet their respective 75 percent benchmarks, plus 10 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's total Mobility Fund Phase II support received in the relevant census block group(s) or census tract(s) over the six-year period for deployment. The mobile eligible telecommunications carrier will have six months to repay the support USAC seeks to recover. After the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has paid the calculated recovery amount, the Bureaus will calculate a reduced support payment for the remaining support term. The reduced ongoing annual support amount will be the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's original winning bid amount for annual support in any such census block group or census tract, multiplied by the sum of the actual deployment percentage plus 25 percent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the difference between 100 percent coverage and the required 75 percent minimum coverage), <PRTPAGE P="264"/>or (annual support) * (percentage covered + 0.25). If at the end of six months the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has not fully paid back the support for missing the relevant 75 percent benchmark(s), the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier shall be liable for repayment of all the support that has been disbursed to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier for that state, the Wireline Competition Bureau or the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will issue a letter to that effect, and USAC will draw on the letter(s) of credit to recover all the support that has been disbursed to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier for that state. In the event that USAC draws on a letter of credit to recover all the support that has been disbursed to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier for a state, the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's participation in Mobility Fund Phase II in that state will immediately end and no further support will be paid.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance reviews.</E> If, subsequent to the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's final milestone but during the remaining support term, USAC determines in the course of a compliance review that the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier does not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is offering service to the required percentage of square miles by census block group or census tract, or state, USAC shall withhold support for a period not to exceed six months until the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier demonstrates that it is again providing the requisite service to the required percentage of square miles. Once the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier demonstrates that it is providing the requisite service to the required percentage of square miles and USAC has verified the demonstration, USAC will pay any withheld support and resume ongoing disbursements. If the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier does not provide a verifiable demonstration of coverage within the permitted six-month period, USAC shall recover an amount of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per square mile received in the winning bid area over the six-year deployment period for the relevant number of square miles for which the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier has failed to produce sufficient evidence, plus 10 percent of the mobile eligible telecommunications carrier's total support received in that winning bid area over the six-year deployment time period, and will calculate a reduced ongoing annual support amount as set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, as appropriate.</P>

Failure to comply with any provisions of these rules may be grounds for rejection of the non-complying publication, a determination that it is unlawful or other action. Where an FRN has been omitted from a cover letter or transmittal accompanying a tariff publication filed under this part or the FRN included in that letter is invalid, the submitting carrier or carrier representative shall have ten (10) business days from the date of filing to amend the cover letter or transmittal to include a valid FRN. If within that ten (10) business day period, the carrier or carrier representative amends the cover letter or transmittal to include a valid FRN, that FRN shall be deemed to have been included in the letter as of its original filing date. If, after the expiration of the ten (10) business day period, the cover letter or transmittal has not been amended to include a valid FRN, the related tariff publication may be rejected if it has not yet become effective, declared unlawful if it has become effective, or subject to other action.</P>
              <P>(c) No carrier required to file tariffs may provide any interstate or foreign communication service until every tariff publication for such communication service is on file with the Commission and in effect.</P>

In filing entities with multiple study areas, if it becomes necessary to calculate the Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month for a specific study area, then the Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month for that study area is determined as follows, using base period demand revenues (adjusted to remove Universal Service Contributions assessed to Local Exchange Carriers pursuant to § 54.702 of this chapter), Base Factor Portion (BFP) and 2000 annual filing base period lines:</P>
              <P>Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line Month in a study area = Price Cap CMT Revenue × (BFP in the study area ÷ (BFP in the Filing Entity) ÷ (Lines in the study area.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">CLEC</E> shall mean a local exchange carrier that provides some or all of the interstate exchange access services used to send traffic to or from an end user and does not fall within the definition of “incumbent local exchange carrier” in 47 U.S.C. 251(h).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Competing ILEC</E> shall mean the incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 251(h), that would provide interstate exchange access services, in whole or in part, to the extent those services were not provided by the CLEC.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Switched exchange access services</E> shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) The functional equivalent of the ILEC interstate exchange access services typically associated with the following rate elements: Carrier common line (originating); carrier common line (terminating); local end office switching; interconnection charge; information surcharge; tandem switched transport termination (fixed); tandem switched transport facility (per mile); tandem switching;</P>
              <P>(ii) The termination of interexchange telecommunications traffic to any end user, either directly or via contractual or other arrangements with an affiliated or unaffiliated provider of interconnected VoIP service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(25), or a non-interconnected VoIP service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(36), that does not itself seek to collect reciprocal compensation charges prescribed by this subpart for that traffic, regardless of the specific functions provided or facilities used.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Non-rural ILEC</E> shall mean an incumbent local exchange carrier that is not a <E T="03">rural telephone company</E> under 47 U.S.C. 153(44).</P>
              <P>(5) The <E T="03">rate</E> for interstate switched exchange access services shall mean the composite, per-minute rate for these services, including all applicable fixed and traffic-sensitive charges.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Rural CLEC</E> shall mean a CLEC that does not serve (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> terminate traffic to or originate traffic from) any end users located within either:</P>
              <P>(i) Any incorporated place of 50,000 inhabitants or more, based on the most recently available population statistics of the Census Bureau or</P>
              <P>(ii) An urbanized area, as defined by the Census Bureau.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (e), and (g) of this section, a CLEC shall not file a tariff for its interstate switched exchange access services that prices those services above the higher of:</P>
              <P>(1) The rate charged for such services by the competing ILEC or</P>
              <P>(2) The lower of:</P>
              <P>(i) The benchmark rate described in paragraph (c) of this section or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of interstate switched exchange access service, the lowest rate that the CLEC has tariffed for its interstate exchange access services, within the six months preceding June 20, 2001.</P>
              <P>(c) The benchmark rate for a CLEC's switched exchange access services will be the rate charged for similar services by the competing ILEC. If an ILEC to which a CLEC benchmarks its rates, pursuant to this section, lowers the rate to which a CLEC benchmarks, the CLEC must revise its rates to the lower level within 15 days of the effective date of the lowered ILEC rate.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, and notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in the event that, after June 20, 2001, a CLEC begins serving end users in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) where it has not previously served end users, the CLEC shall not file a tariff for its exchange access services in that MSA that prices those services above the rate charged for such services by the competing ILEC.</P>

              <P>(e) Rural exemption. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, and notwithstanding paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, a rural CLEC competing with a non-rural ILEC shall not file a tariff for its interstate exchange access services that prices those services above the rate prescribed in the NECA access tariff, assuming the highest rate band for local switching. In addition to that NECA rate, the rural CLEC may assess a presubscribed interexchange carrier charge if, and only to the extent that, <PRTPAGE P="284"/>the competing ILEC assesses this charge. Beginning July 1, 2013, all CLEC reciprocal compensation rates for intrastate switched exchange access services subject to this subpart also shall be no higher than that NECA rate.</P>
              <P>(f) If a CLEC provides some portion of the switched exchange access services used to send traffic to or from an end user not served by that CLEC, the rate for the access services provided may not exceed the rate charged by the competing ILEC for the same access services, except if the CLEC is listed in the database of the Number Portability Administration Center as providing the calling party or dialed number, the CLEC may, to the extent permitted by § 51.913(b) of this chapter, assess a rate equal to the rate that would be charged by the competing ILEC for all exchange access services required to deliver interstate traffic to the called number.</P>
              <P>(g) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) A CLEC engaging in access stimulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(bbb), shall not file a tariff for its interstate exchange access services that prices those services above the rate prescribed in the access tariff of the price cap LEC with the lowest switched access rates in the state.</P>
              <P>(2) A CLEC engaging in access stimulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(bbb), shall file revised interstate switched access tariffs within forty-five (45) days of commencing access stimulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(bbb), or within forty-five (45) days of [date] if the CLEC on that date is engaged in access stimulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(bbb).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Optional supporting information to be submitted with letters of transmittal for Access Tariff filings by incumbent local exchange carriers serving 50,000 or fewer access lines in a given study area that are described as subset 3 carriers in § 69.602.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a<E T="03">) Scope.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, This section provides for an optional method of filing for any local exchange carrier that is described as a subset 3 carrier in § 69.602 of this chapter, which elects to issue its own Access Tariff for a period commencing on or after April 1, 1989, and which serves 50,000 or fewer access lines in a study area as determined under § 36.611(a)(8) of this chapter. However, the Commission may require any carrier to submit such information as may be necessary for review of a tariff filing. This section (other than the preceding sentence of this paragraph) shall not apply to tariff filings of local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Explanation and data supporting tariff changes.</E> The material to be submitted to either a tariff change or a new tariff which affects rates or charges must include an explanation of the filing in the transmittal as required by § 61.15. The basis for ratemaking must comply with the following requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, it is not necessary to submit this supporting data at the time of filing. However, the incumbent local exchange carrier should be prepared to submit the data promptly upon reasonable request by the Commission or interested parties.</P>
              <P>(1) For a tariff change, the incumbent local exchange carrier that is a cost schedule carrier must propose Traffic Sensitive rates based on the following:</P>
              <P>(i) For the first period, a cost of service study for Traffic Sensitive elements for the most recent 12-month period with related demand for the same period.</P>
              <P>(ii) For subsequent filings, a cost of service study for Traffic Sensitive elements for the total period since the incumbent local exchange carrier's last annual filing, with related demand for the same period.</P>
              <P>(2) For a tariff change, the incumbent local exchange carrier that is an average schedule carrier must propose Traffic Sensitive rates based on the following:</P>
              <P>(i) For the first period, the incumbent local exchange carrier's most recent annual Traffic Sensitive settlement from the National Exchange Carrier Association pool.</P>
              <P>(ii) For subsequent filings, an amount calculated to reflect the Traffic Sensitive average schedule pool settlement the carrier would have received if the carrier had continued to participate, based upon the most recent average schedule formulas approved by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(3) For a tariff change, the incumbent local exchange carrier that is a cost schedule carrier must propose Common Line rates based on the following:</P>

              <P>(i) For the first biennial filing, the common line revenue requirement shall be determined by a cost of service <PRTPAGE P="287"/>study for the most recent 12-month period. Subscriber line charges shall be based on cost and demand data for the same period. Carrier common line rates shall be determined by the following formula:</P>

              <P>(5) For End User Common Line charges included in a tariff pursuant to this Section, the incumbent local exchange carrier must provide supporting information for the two-year historical period with its letter of transmittal in accordance with § 61.38.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Maximum allowable rate of return.</E> Incumbent Local exchange carriers filing tariffs under this section are not required to comply with §§ 65.700 through 65.701 of this chapter, except with respect to periods during which tariffs were not subject to this section. The Commission may require any carrier to submit such information if it deems it necessary to monitor the carrier's earnings. However, rates must be <PRTPAGE P="289"/>calculated based on the incumbent local exchange carrier's prescribed rate of return applicable to the period during which the rates are effective.</P>
              <P>(d) Rates for a new service that is the same as that offered by a price cap local exchange carrier providing service in an adjacent serving area are deemed presumptively lawful, if the proposed rates, in the aggregate, are no greater than the rates established by the price cap local exchange carrier. Tariff filings made pursuant to this paragraph must include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A brief explanation of why the service is like an existing service offered by a geographically adjacent price cap local exchange carrier; and</P>
              <P>(2) Data to establish compliance with this paragraph that, in aggregate, the proposed rates for the new service are no greater than those in effect for the same or comparable service offered by that same geographically adjacent price cap regulated local exchange carrier. Compliance may be shown through submission of applicable tariff pages of the adjacent carrier; a showing that the serving areas are adjacent; any necessary explanations and work sheets.</P>
              <P>(e) Average schedule companies filing pursuant to this section shall retain their status as average schedule companies.</P>
              <P>(f) On each page of cost support material submitted pursuant to this section, the issuing carrier shall indicate the transmittal number under which that page was submitted.</P>
              <P>(g) A local exchange carrier otherwise eligible to file a tariff pursuant to this section may not do so if it is engaging in access stimulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(bbb) of this part, and has not terminated its access revenue sharing agreement(s). A carrier so engaged must file interstate access tariffs in accordance with § 61.38, and § 69.3(e)(12)(1) of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Private line rate structure guidelines.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commission uses a variety of tools to determine whether a dominant carrier's private line tariffs are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory. The dominant carrier's burden of cost justification can be reduced when its private line rate structures comply with the following five guidelines.</P>
              <P>(1) Rate structures for the same or comparable services should be integrated;</P>
              <P>(2) Rate structures for the same or comparable services should be consistent with one another;</P>
              <P>(3) Rate elements should be selected to reflect market demand, pricing convenience for the carrier and customers, and cost characteristics; a rate element which appears separately in one rate structure should appear separately in all other rate structures;</P>
              <P>(4) Rate elements should be consistently defined with respect to underlying service functions and should be consistently employed through all rate structures; and</P>
              <P>(5) Rate structures should be simple and easy to understand.</P>
              <P>(b) The guidelines do not preclude a carrier, in a given case when a private line tariff does not comply with these guidelines, from justifying its departure from the guidelines and showing that its tariff is just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.</P>

              <P>(b) If a telephone company, or any one of a group of affiliated telephone companies, files a price cap tariff in <PRTPAGE P="290"/>one study area, that telephone company and its affiliates, except its average schedule affiliates, must file price cap tariffs in all their study areas.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the following rules in this paragraph (c) apply to telephone companies subject to price cap regulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee), which are involved in mergers, acquisitions, or similar transactions.</P>
              <P>(1) Any telephone company subject to price cap regulation that is a party to a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction shall continue to be subject to price cap regulation notwithstanding such transaction.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a telephone company subject to price cap regulation acquires, is acquired by, merges with, or otherwise becomes affiliated with a telephone company that is not subject to price cap regulation, the latter telephone company shall become subject to price cap regulation no later than one year following the effective date of such merger, acquisition, or similar transaction and shall accordingly file price cap tariffs to be effective no later than that date in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part 61.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 61.41(c)(2), when a telephone company subject to price cap regulation acquires, is acquired by, merges with, or otherwise becomes affiliated with a telephone company that qualifies as an “average schedule” company, the latter company may retain its “average schedule” status or become subject to price cap regulation in accordance with § 69.3(i)(3) of this chapter and the requirements referenced in that section.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, local exchange carriers that become subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ff) shall not be eligible to withdraw from such regulation.</P>
              <P>(e) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a telephone company subject to rate-of-return regulation may return lines acquired from a telephone company subject to price cap regulation to rate-of-return regulation, provided that the acquired lines will not be subject to average schedule settlements, and provided further that the telephone company subject to rate-of-return regulation may not for five years elect price cap regulation for itself, or by any means cause the acquired lines to become subject to price cap regulation.</P>
              <P>(f) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a telephone company subject to rate-of-return regulation that is affiliated with a price cap local exchange carrier may provide business data services pursuant to § 61.50 without converting other services to price cap regulation.</P>

Once any price cap local exchange carrier tariff entity's ATS Charge is equal to the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq) for the first time (the former NYNEX telephone companies may be treated as a separate tariff entity), then, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, X is equal to GDP-PI and no further reductions will be mandated (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> if applying the full X-factor reduction for a given year would reduce the ATS charge below the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq), the amount of X-factor reduction applied that year will be the amount necessary to reach the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq)). A filing entity does not reach the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq) in any year in which it exercises an exogenous adjustment pursuant to § 61.45(d)(vii). For companies with separate tariff entities under a single price cap, the following rules shall apply:</P>
              <P>(A) Targeting amounts as defined in § 61.45(i)(1)(i) shall be identified separately, using the revenue for each of the tariff entities under the cap.</P>
              <P>(B) Each tariff entity shall only be required to use the amount of targeting necessary to get to the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq).</P>

              <P>(iii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, once the Tariff Entity's Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq) is achieved, the X-factor for the CMT basket will equal GDP-PI as long as GDP-PI is less than or equal to 6.5% and greater than 0%. If GDP-PI is greater than 6.5%, and an <PRTPAGE P="293"/>entity has eliminated its CCL and multi-line business PICCs charges, the X-factor for the CMT basket will equal 6.5%, and all End User Common Line charges, rates and nominal caps, will be increased by the difference between GDP-PI and the 6.5% X-factor. If GDP-PI is less than 0, the X-factor for the CMT basket will be 0.</P>
              <P>(B) For tariff filing entities with a Target Rate of $0.0095, or for the portion of a filing entity consolidated pursuant to § 61.48(o) that, prior to such consolidation, had a Target Rate of $0.0095, in which the ATS charge has achieved the Target Rate but in which the carrier common line (CCL) charge has not been eliminated, the X-factor for the CMT basket will be 6.5% until the earlier of June 30, 2004, or until CCL charges are eliminated pursuant to paragraph (i)(4) of this section. Thereafter, in any filing entity in which a CCL charge remains after July 1, 2004, the X-factor for the CMT basket will be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section as if CCL charges were eliminated.</P>
              <P>(iv) For the special access basket specified in § 61.42(d)(5), the value of X shall be 2.0% beginning December 1, 2017, notwithstanding any language in § 61.45(b)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(v) For the interexchange basket specified in § 61.42(d)(4), the value of X shall be 3.0% for all annual filings.</P>
              <P>(2) Adjustments to price cap local exchange carrier PCIs and average price cap CMT revenue per line, in tariff filings other than the annual access tariff filing, for the CMT basket described in § 61.42(d)(1), the traffic sensitive basket described in § 61.42(d)(2), the trunking basket described in § 61.42(d)(3), the interexchange basket described in § 61.42(d)(4), and the special access basket described in § 61.42(d)(5), shall be made pursuant to the formulas set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, except that the “w(GDP-PI − X)” component of those PCI formulas shall not be employed.</P>
              <P>(c) Effective July 1, 2000, the prices of the CMT basket rate elements, excluding special access surcharges under § 69.115 of this chapter and line ports in excess of basic under § 69.157 of this chapter, shall be set based upon Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month.</P>

              <P>(ii) Such changes in the Uniform System of Accounts, including changes in the Uniform System of Accounts requirements made pursuant to § 32.16 of this chapter, as the Commission shall permit or require be treated as exogenous by rule, rule waiver, or declaratory ruling;</P>

              <P>(vii) Retargeting the PCI to the level specified by the Commission for carriers whose base year earnings are below the level of the lower adjustment mark, subject to the limitation in § 69.731 of this chapter. The allocation of LFAM amounts will be allocated pursuant to § 61.45(d)(3). This section shall not be applicable to tariff filings during the tariff year beginning July 1, 2000, but is applicable in subsequent years;</P>
              <P>(viii) Inside wire amortizations;</P>
              <P>(ix) The completion of amortization of equal access expenses.</P>

              <P>(2) Price cap local exchange carriers specified in §§ 61.41(a)(2) or (a)(3) shall, in their annual access tariff filing, recognize all exogenous cost changes attributable to modifications during the coming tariff year in their Subscriber Plant Factor and the Dial Equipment Minutes factor, and completions of inside wire amortizations and reserve deficiency amortizations.<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Exogenous cost changes shall be apportioned on a cost-causative basis between price cap services as a group, and excluded services as a group. Total exogenous cost changes thus attributed to price cap services shall be recovered from services other than those used to calculate the ATS charge.</P>
              <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(f) The exogenous costs caused by new services subject to price cap regulation must be included in the appropriate PCI calculations under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section beginning at the first annual price cap tariff filing following completion of the base period in which such services are introduced.</P>
              <P>(g) In the event that a price cap tariff becomes effective, which tariff results in an API value (calculated pursuant to § 61.46) that exceeds the currently applicable PCI value, the PCI value shall be adjusted upward to equal the API value.</P>
              <P>(h) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(i)(1)(i) Price cap local exchange carriers that are recovering revenues through rates pursuant to §§ 69.106, 69.108, 69.109, 69.110, 69.111, 69.112, 69.113, 69.118, 69.123, 69.124, 69.125, 69.129, or § 69.155 of this chapter shall target, to the extent necessary to reduce the ATS Charge to the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq) for the first time, any PCI reductions associated with the dollar impact of application of the (GDP-PI − X) portion of the formula in § 61.45(b)(1)(i) to the traffic sensitive and trunking baskets. In order to calculate the actual dollars to transfer to the trunking and traffic sensitive baskets, carriers will first determine the “Targeted Revenue Differential” that will be transferred to the trunking and traffic sensitive baskets to reduce the ATS Charge to the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq). The Targeted Revenue Differential shall be applied only to the trunking and traffic sensitive baskets to the extent necessary to reduce the ATS charge to the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq), and shall not be applied to reduce the PCIs in any other basket or to reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month, except as provided in § 61.45(i)(4).</P>
              <P>(ii) For the purposes of § 61.45(i)(1)(i), Targeted Revenue Differential will be determined by adding together the following amounts:</P>
              <P>(A) R * (GDP-PI − X) for the traffic sensitive basket, trunking basket, and the CMT basket excluding CCL revenues; and</P>
              <P>(B) CCL Revenues * [(GDP-PI − X − (g / 2)] / [1 + (g / 2)]</P>
              <P>Where “g” is defined in § 61.45(b)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(2) Until a tariff entity's ATS Charge equals the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3 (qq) for the first time, the Targeted Revenue Differential will be targeted to reduce the following rates for that tariff filing entity, in order of priority:</P>
              <P>(i) To the residual per minute Transport Interconnection Charge, until that rate is $0.00; then</P>
              <P>(ii) To the Information Surcharge, until that rate is $0.00; then</P>

              <P>(iii) To the other Local Switching charges and Switched Transport charges until the tariff entity's ATS Rate equals the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq) for the first time. In making these reductions, the reductions to Local Switching rates as a percentage of total X-factor reductions must be greater than or equal to the percentage proportion of Local Switching revenues to the total sum of revenues for Local Switching, Local Switching Trunk Ports, Signalling Transfer Point Port Termination, Switched Direct Trunked Transport, Signalling for Switched Direct Trunked Transport, Entrance Facilities for switched access traffic, Tandem Switched Transport, and Signalling for Tandem Switching (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Local Switching gets at least its proportionate share of reductions).</P>

              <P>(3) After a price cap local exchange carrier reaches the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq), the ATS Rate will be recalculated each subsequent Annual Filing. This process will identify the new ATS Charge for the new base period level. Due to change in base period demand and inclusion of new services for that annual filing, the absolute level of a tariff entity's ATS Charge may change. The resulting new ATS Charge level will be what that tariff entity will be measured against during that base period. For example, if a <PRTPAGE P="295"/>company whose target is $0.0055 reached the Target Rate during the 2000 annual filing, that level may change to $0.0058 in the 2001 annual filing due to change in demand and inclusion of new services. Therefore, it will be the $0.0058 average rate that the tariff entity will be measured against for all non-annual filings. Likewise, if that same company was at the Target Rate during the 2000 filing, that level may change to $0.0053 average rate in the 2001 annual filing due to change in demand and inclusion of new services. In that case, it will be at the $0.0053 average rate that the tariff entity will be measured.</P>
              <P>(4) A company electing a $0.0095 Target Rate will, in the tariff year it reaches the Target Rate, apply any Targeted Revenue Differential remaining after reaching the Target Rate to reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month until the CCL charge is eliminated. In subsequent years, until the earlier of June 30, 2004 or when the CCL charge is eliminated, tariff filing entities with a Target Rate of $0.0095, or the portion of a filing entity consolidated pursuant to § 61.48(o) that, prior to such consolidation, had a Target Rate of $0.0095, will reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month according to the following method:</P>
              <P>(i) Filing entity calculates the maximum allowable carrier common line revenue, as defined in § 61.46(d)(1), that would be permitted in the absence of further adjustment pursuant to this paragraph;</P>

              <P>(ii) Filing entity identifies maximum amount of dollars available to reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month by the following:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(CMT revenue in a $0.0095 Area −CCL revenue in a $0.0095 Area) * (GDP-PI −X) + (CCL Revenue in a $0.0095 Area) * [(GDP-PI − X) − (g / 2)] / [1 + (g / 2)]</FP>
              
              <P>(iii) The Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month shall then be reduced by the lesser of the amount described in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section and the amount described in paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section, divided by base period Switched Access End User Common Line Charge lines.</P>

              <P>(c) In the event that the introduction of a new service requires the creation of a new service category or subcategory, a new SBI must be established for that service category or subcategory beginning at the first annual price cap tariff filing following completion of the base period in which the new service is introduced. The new SBI should be initialized at a value of 100, corresponding to the service category or subcategory rates in effect the last day of the base period, and thereafter should be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Any price cap tariff filing proposing rate restructuring shall require an adjustment to the affected SBI pursuant to the general methodology described in paragraph (a) of this section. This adjustment requires the conversion of existing rates in the rate element group into rates of equivalent value under the proposed structure, and then the comparison of the existing rates that have been converted to reflect restructuring to the proposed restructured rates. This calculation may require use of carrier data and estimation techniques to assign customers of the preexisting service to those services (including the new restructured service) that will remain or become available after restructuring.</P>

              <P>(e) Pricing bands shall be established each tariff year for each service category and subcategory within a basket. Each band shall limit the pricing flexibility of the service category, subcategory, as reflected in the SBI, to an annual increase of a specified percent listed in this paragraph, relative to the percentage change in the PCI for that basket, measured from the levels in effect on the last day of the preceding tariff year. For local exchanage carriers subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee), there <PRTPAGE P="297"/>shall be no lower pricing band for any service category or subcategory.</P>

              <P>(f) A price cap local exchange carrier may establish density zones pursuant to the requirements set forth in § 69.123 of this chapter, for any service in the trunking and special access baskets, other than the interconnection charge set forth in § 69.124 of this chapter. The pricing flexibility of each zone shall be limited to an annual increase of 15 percent, relative to the percentage change in the PCI for that basket, measured from the levels in effect on the last day of the preceding tariff year. There shall be no lower pricing band for any density zone.</P>

              <P>(2) Effective January 1, 1998, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, if a price cap local exchange carrier is recovering interconnection charge revenues through per-minute rates pursuant to § 69.155 of this chapter, any reductions to the PCI for the basket designated in § 61.42(d)(3) resulting from the application of the provisions of § 61.45(b)(1)(i) and from the application of the provisions of §§ 61.45(i)(1) and 61.45(i)(2) shall be directed to the SBI of the service category designated in § 61.42(d)(i).</P>
              <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(4) Effective January 1, 1998, the SBI reduction required by paragraph (i)(2) of this section shall be determined by dividing the sum of the dollar amount of any PCI reduction required by §§ 61.45(i)(1) and 61.45(i)(2), by the dollar amount associated with the SBI for the service category designated in § 61.42(e)(2)(vi), and multiplying the SBI for the service category designated in § 61.42(e)(2)(vi) by one minus the resulting ratio.</P>
              <P>(5) Effective July 1, 2000, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and subject to the limitations of § 61.45(i), if a price cap local exchange carrier is recovering an ATS charge greater than its Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq), any reductions to the PCI for the traffic sensitive or trunking baskets designated in §§ 61.42(d)(2) and 61.42(d)(3) resulting from the application of the provisions of § 61.45(b), and the formula in § 61.45(b) and from the application of the provisions of §§ 61.45(i)(1), and 61.45(i)(2) shall be directed to the SBIs of the service categories designated in §§ 61.42(e)(1) and 61.42(e)(2).</P>

              <P>(l) <E T="03">Average Traffic Sensitive Revenues.</E> (1) In the July 1, 2000 annual filing, price cap local exchange carriers will make an additional reduction to rates comprising ATS charge, and to associated SBI upper limits and PCIs. This reduction will be calculated to be the amount that would be necessary to achieve a total $2.1 billion reduction in carrier common line and ATS rates by all price cap local exchange carriers, compared with those rates as they existed on June 30, 2000 using 2000 annual filing base period demand.</P>
              <P>(i) The net change in revenue associated with Carrier Common Line Rate elements resulting from:</P>

              <P>(A) The removal from access of price cap local exchange carrier contributions to the Federal universal service mechanisms;<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) Price cap local exchange carrier receipts of interstate access universal service support pursuant to subpart J of part 54;</P>
              <P>(C) Changes in End User Common Line Charges and PICC rates;</P>
              <P>(D) Changes in Carrier Common Line charges due to GDP-PI − X targeting for $0.0095 filing entities.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reductions in Average Traffic Sensitive charges resulting from:</P>
              <P>(A) Targeting of the application of the (GDP-PI − X) portion of the formula in § 61.45(b), and any applicable “g” adjustments;</P>
              <P>(B) The removal from access of price cap local exchange carrier contributions to the Federal universal service mechanisms;</P>
              <P>(C) Additional ATS charge reductions defined in paragraph (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Once the reductions in paragraph (l)(1)(i) and paragraphs (l)(1)(ii)(A) and (l)(1)(ii)(B) of this section are identified, the difference between those reductions and $2.1 billion is the total amount of additional reductions that would be made to ATS rates of price cap local exchange carriers. This amount will then be restated as the percentage of total price cap local exchange carrier Local Switching revenues as of June 30, 2000 using 2000 annual filing base period demand (“June 30 Local Switching revenues”) necessary to yield the total amount of additional reductions and taking into account the fact that, if participating, a price cap local exchange carrier would not reduce ATS rates below its Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq).Each price cap local exchange carrier then reduces ATS rate elements, and associated SBI upper limits and PCIs, by a dollar amount equivalent to the percentage times the June 30 Local Switching revenues for that filing entity, provided that no price cap local exchange carrier shall be required to reduce its ATS rates below its Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq). Each price cap local exchange carrier can take its additional reductions against any of the ATS rate elements, provided that at least a proportional share must be taken against Local Switching rates.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Pooled Local Switching Revenues.</E> (1) Price cap local exchange carriers are permitted to pool local switching revenues in their CMT basket under one of the following conditions.</P>

              <P>(i) Any price cap local exchange carrier that would otherwise have July 1, 2000 price cap reductions as a percentage of Base Period Price Cap Revenues at the holding company level greater than the industry wide total July 1, 2000 price cap revenue reduction as a percentage of Base Period Price Cap Revenues may elect temporarily to pool the amount of the additional reductions above 25% of the Local Switching element revenues necessary to yield that carrier's proportionate share of a total $2.1 billion reduction in switched access usage rates on July 1, 2000. The basis of the reduction calculation will be R at PCI<E T="52">t-1</E> for the upcoming tariff year. The percentage reductions per line amounts will be calculated as follows: (Total Price Cap Revenue Reduction ÷ Base Period Price Cap Revenues)</P>
              <P>Pooled local switching revenue for each filing entity within a holding company that qualifies under this paragraph (i) will continue until such pooled revenues are eliminated under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 61.45(b)(1), once the Average Traffic Sensitive (ATS) rate reaches the applicable Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq), the Targeted Revenue Differential as defined in § 61.45(i) shall be targeted to reducing pooled local switching revenue until the pooled local switching revenue is eliminated. Thereafter, the X-factor for these baskets will be determined in accordance with § 61.45(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) Price cap local exchange carriers other than the Bell companies and GTE with at least 20% of total holding company lines operated by companies that as of December 31, 1999 were certified to the Commission as rural carriers, may elect to pool up to the following amounts:</P>

              <P>(A) For a price cap holding company's predominantly non-rural filing entities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> filing entities within which more than 50% of all lines are operated by telephone companies other than those that as of December 31, 1999 were certified to the Commission as rural telephone companies), the amount of the additional reductions to Average Traffic Sensitive Charge rates <PRTPAGE P="300"/>as defined in paragraph (l)(2) of this section, to the extent such reductions exceed 25% of the Local Switching element revenues (measured in terms of June 30, 2000 rates times 1999 base period demand);</P>

              <P>(B) For a price cap holding company's predominantly rural filing entities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> filing entities with greater than 50% of lines operated by telephone companies that as of December 31, 1999 were certified to the Commission as rural telephone companies), the amount of the additional reductions to Average Traffic Sensitive Charge rates as defined in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Allocation of Pooled Local Switching Revenue to Certain CMT Elements</P>
              <P>(i) The pooled local switching revenue for each filing entity is shifted to the CMT basket within price caps. Pooled local switching revenue will not be included in calculations to determine the eligibility for interstate access universal service funding.</P>
              <P>(ii) Pooled local switching revenue will be capped on a revenue per line basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) Pooled local switching revenue is included in the total revenue for the CMT basket in calculating the X-factor reduction targeted to the traffic sensitive rate elements, and for companies qualified under paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section, to pooled elements after the Average Traffic Sensitive Charge reaches the target level. For the purpose of targeting X-factor reductions, companies that allocate pooled local switching revenue to other filing entities pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(vii) of this section shall include pooled local switching revenue in the total revenue of the CMT basket of the filing entity from which the pooled local switching revenue originated.</P>
              <P>(iv) Pooled local switching revenue shall be kept separate from CMT revenue in the CMT basket. CMT rate elements for each filing entity shall first be set based on CMT revenue per line without regard to the presence of pooled local switching revenue for each filing entity.</P>
              <P>(v) If the rates generated without regard to the presence of pooled local switching revenue for multi-line business PICC and/or multi-line business SLC are below the nominal caps of $4.31 and $9.20, respectively, pooled amounts can be added to these rate elements to the extent permitted by the nominal caps.</P>
              <P>(vi) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 69.152(k) of this chapter, pooled local switching revenue is first added to the multi-line business SLC until the rate equals the nominal cap ($9.20) or the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated. If pooled local switching revenue remains after applying amounts to the multi-line business SLC, notwithstanding the provisions of § 69.153 of this chapter, the remaining pooled local switching revenue may be added to the multi-line business PICC until the rate equals the nominal cap ($4.31) or the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated. Unallocated pooled local switching revenue may still remain. For companies pooling pursuant to paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section, these unallocated amounts may not be recovered from the CCL charge, the primary residential and single-line business SLC, a non-primary residential SLC, or from CMT elements in any other filing entity.</P>
              <P>(vii) For companies pooling pursuant to paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section, pooled local switching revenue that can not be allocated to the multi-line business PICC and multi-line business SLC rates within an individual filing entity may not be recovered from the CCL charge, primary residential and single-line business SLC or residential/single-line business SLC charges, but may be allocated to other filing entities within the holding company, and collected by adding these amounts to the multi-line business PICC and multi-line business SLC rates. The allocation of pooled local switching revenue among filing entities will be re-calculated at each annual filing. In subsequent annual filings, pooled local switching revenue that was allocated to another filing entity will be reallocated to the filing entity from where it originated, to the full extent permitted by the nominal caps of $9.20 and $4.31.</P>

              <P>(viii) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 69.152(k) of this chapter, these unallocated local switching revenues <PRTPAGE P="301"/>that cannot be recovered fully pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(vii) of this section are first added to the multi-line business SLC of other filing entities until the resulting rate equals the nominal cap ($9.20) or the pooled local switching revenue for the holding company is fully allocated. If the pooled local switching revenue can be fully allocated to the multi-line business SLC, the amount is distributed to each filing entity with a rate below the nominal cap ($9.20) based on its below-cap multi-line business SLC revenue as a percentage of the total holding company's below-cap multi-line business SLC revenue.</P>
              <P>(ix) If pooled local switching revenue remains after applying amounts to the multi-line business SLC of all filing entities in the holding company, pooled local switching revenue may be added to the multi-line business PICC of other filing entities. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 69.153 of this chapter, the remaining pooled local switching revenue is distributed to each filing entity with a rate below the nominal cap ($4.31) based on its below-cap multi-line business PICC revenue as a percentage of the total holding company's below-cap multi-line business PICC revenue.</P>
              <P>(x) If pooled local switching revenue is added to the multi-line business SLC but not to the multi-line business PICC for a filing entity that qualified to deaverage SLCs without regard to pooled local switching revenue, the resulting SLC rates can still be deaveraged. Total pooled local switching revenue is added to the deaveraged zone 1 multi-line business SLC rate until the per line rate in zone 1 equals the rate in zone 2 or until the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated to the deaveraged multi-line business SLC rate for zone 1. If pooled local switching revenue remains after the rate in zone 1 equals zone 2, the deaveraged rates of zone 1 and zone 2 are increased until the pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated to the deaveraged multi-line business SLC rates of zone 1 and 2 or until those rates reach the zone 3 multi-line business SLC rate level. This process continues until pooled local switching revenue is fully allocated to the zone deaveraged rates.</P>
              <P>(n) Establishment of the special access basket, effective July 1, 2000.</P>
              <P>(1) On the effective date, the PCI value for the special access basket, as defined in § 61.42(d)(5) shall be equal to the PCI for the trunking basket on the day preceding the establishment of the special access basket.</P>
              <P>(2) On the effective date, the API value for the special access basket, as defined in § 61.42(d)(5) shall be equal to the API for the trunking basket on the day preceding the establishment of the special access basket.</P>
              <P>(3) Service Category, Subcategory, and Density Zone SBIs and Upper Limits.</P>
              <P>(i) Interconnection, Tandem Switched Transport, and Signalling Interconnec- tion will retain the SBIs and upper limits and remain in the trunking basket.</P>
              <P>(ii) Audio/Video and Wideband will retain the SBIs and upper limits and be moved into the special access basket.</P>
              <P>(iii) For Voice Grade, the SBIs and upper limits in both baskets will be equal to the SBIs and upper limits in the existing trunking basket on the day preceding the establishment of the special access basket. Voice Grade density zones in the trunking basket will retain their indices and upper limits. Voice Grade density zones will be initialized in the special access basket when services are first offered in them.</P>
              <P>(iv) For High Cap/DDS, DS1, and DS3 category and subcategories, the SBIs and upper limits in both baskets will be equal to the SBIs and upper limits in the existing trunking basket on the day preceding the establishment of the special access basket. SBIs and upper limits for services that are in both combined density zones and either DTT/EF or special access density zones will be calculated by using weighted averages of the indices in the affected zones.</P>

              <P>(v) For each DTT/EF-related zone remaining in the trunking basket, the values will be calculated by taking the sum of the products of the DTT/EF revenues times the DTT/EF index (or upper limit) and the DTT/EF-related revenues in the combined zone times the combined index (or upper limit), <PRTPAGE P="302"/>and dividing by the total DTT/EF-related revenues for that zone.</P>
              <P>(vi) For each special access-related zone in the special access basket, the values will be calculated by taking the sum of the products of the special access revenues times the special access index (or upper limit) and the special access-related revenues in the combined zone times the combined index (or upper limit), and dividing by the total special access-related revenues for that zone.</P>
              <P>(o) Treatment of acquisitions of exchanges with different ATS Target Rates as set forth in § 61.3(qq):</P>
              <P>(1) In the event that a price cap local exchange carrier acquires a filing entity or portion thereof from a price cap local exchange carrier after July 1, 2000, and the price cap local exchange carrier did not have a binding and executed contract to purchase that filing entity or portion thereof as of April 1, 2000, those properties retain their pre-existing Target Rates as set forth in § 61.3(qq). If those properties are merged into a filing entity with a different Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq), the Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq) for the merged filing entity will be the weighted average of the Target Rates as set forth in § 61.3(qq) for the properties being combined into a single filing entity, with the average weighted by local switching minutes.

              <SUBJECT>Composition of tariffs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Tariffs must contain in consecutive order: A title page; check sheet; table of contents; list of concurring, connecting, and other participating carriers; explanation of symbols and abbreviations; application of tariff; general rules (including definitions), regulations, exceptions and conditions; and rates. If the issuing carrier elects to add a section assisting in the use of the tariff, it should be placed immediately after the table of contents.</P>
              <P>(b) The title page of every tarif_f and supplement must show:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">FCC number, indication of cancellations.</E> In the upper right-hand corner, the designation of the tariff or supplement as “FCC No. ____,” or “Supplement No. ____ to FCC No. ____,” and immediately below, the FCC number or numbers of tariffs or supplements cancelled thereby.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Expiration date.</E> Subject to § 61.59, when the entire tariff or supplement is to expire with a fixed date, the expiration date must be shown in connection with the effective date in the following manner. Changes in expiration date must be made pursuant to the notice requirements of § 61.58, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

              <EXTRACT>
                <FP>Original tariff _effective __________ (here show the effective date of the original tariff).</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(c)(1)(i) The page immediately following the title page must be designated as “Original page 1” and captioned “Check Sheet.” When the original tariff is filed, the check sheet must show the number of pages contained in the tariff. For example, “Page 1 to 150, inclusive, of this tariff are effective as of the date shown.” When new pages are added, they must be numbered in continuing sequence, and designated as “Original page ____ .” For example, when the original tariff filed has 150 pages, the first page added after page 150 is to be designated as “Original page 151,” and the foregoing notation must be revised to include the added pages.</P>
              <P>(ii) Alternatively, the carrier is permitted to number its tariff pages, other than the check sheet, to reflect the section number of the tariff as well as the page. For example, under this system, pages in section 1 of the tariff would be numbered 1-1, 1-2, etc., and pages in section 2 of the tariff would be numbered 2-1, 2-2, etc. Issuing carriers shall utilize only one page numbering system throughout its tariff.</P>

              <P>(2) If pages are to be inserted between numbered pages, each such page must be designated as an original page and must bear the number of the immediately preceding page followed by an <PRTPAGE P="307"/>alpha or numeric suffix. For example, when two new pages are to be inserted between pages 44 and 45 of the tariff, the first inserted page must be designated as Original page 44A or 44.1 and the second inserted page as Original page 44B or 44.2. Issuing carriers may not utilize both the alpha and numeric systems in the same publication.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) When pages are revised, when new pages (including pages with letter or numeric suffix as set forth above) are added to the tariff, or when supplements are issued, the check sheet must be revised accordingly. Revised check sheets must indicate with an asterisk the specific pages added or revised. In addition to the notation in (1), the check sheet must list, under the heading “The original and revised pages named below (and Supplement No. ____) contain all changes from the original tariff that are in effect on the date shown,” all original pages in numerical order that have been added to the tariff and the pages which have been revised, including the revision number.

For example, “First revised page 1 cancels original page 1,” or “Second revised page 2 cancels first revised page 2,” etc. When a revised page omits rates or regulations previously published on the page which it cancels, but such rates or regulations are published on another page, the revised page must make specific reference to the page on which the rates or regulations will be found. This reference must be accomplished by inserting a sentence at the bottom of the revised page that states “Certain rates (or regulations) previously found on this page can now be found on page ___.” In addition, the page on which the omitted material now appears must bear the appropriate symbol opposite such material, and make specific reference to the page from which the rates or regulations were transferred. This reference must be accomplished by inserting a sentence at the bottom of the other page that states “Certain rates (or regulations) on this page formerly appeared on page ____.”</P>
              <P>(5) Rejected pages must be treated as indicated in § 61.69.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Table of contents.</E> The table of contents must contain a full and complete statement showing the exact location and specifying the page or section and page numbers, where information by subjects under general headings will be found.

If there are no concurring carriers, then the statement “no concurring carriers” must be made at the place where the names of the concurring carriers would otherwise appear. If the concurring carriers are numerous, their names may be stated in alphabetical order in a separate tariff filed with the Commission by the issuing carrier. Specific reference to such separate tariff by FCC number must be made in the tariff at the place where such names would otherwise appear.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">List of connecting carriers.</E> This list must contain the exact name or names of connecting carriers, alphabetically arranged, for which rates or regulations are published in the tariff, and the name of the city or town in which the principal office of every such carrier is located. If there are no connecting carriers, then the statement <PRTPAGE P="308"/>“no connecting carriers” must be made at the place where their names would otherwise appear. If connecting carriers are numerous, their names may be stated in alphabetical order in a separate tariff filed with the Commission by the issuing carrier. Specific reference to such separate tariff by FCC number must be made in the tariff at the place where such names would otherwise appear.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">List of other participating carriers.</E> This list must contain the exact name of every other carrier subject to the Act engaging or participating in the communication service to which the tariff or supplement applies, together with the name of the city or town in which the principal office of such carrier is located. If there is no such other carrier, then the statement “no participating carriers” must be made at the place where the names of such other carriers would otherwise appear. If such other carriers are numerous, their names may be stated in alphabetical order in a separate tariff filed with the Commission by the issuing carrier. Specific reference must be made in the tariff at the place where such names would otherwise appear. The names of concurring and connecting carriers properly listed in a tariff published by any other participating carrier need not be repeated in this list.</P>
              <P>(i)(1) <E T="03">Symbols, reference marks, abbreviations.</E> The tariff must contain an explanation of symbols, reference marks, and abbreviations of technical terms used. The following symbols used in tariffs are reserved for the purposes indicated below:

At the same time the issuing carrier revises its tariff to reflect such a concurrence, it must file one copy of the concurrence electronically with <PRTPAGE P="313"/>the Commission in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 61.13 through § 61.17. The concurrence must bear the same effective date as the date of the tariff filing reflecting the concurrence. Carriers shall file revisions reflecting concurrences in their tariffs on the notice period specified in § 61.58.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Streamlining procedures for domestic transfer of control applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Any domestic carrier that seeks to transfer control of lines or authorization to operate pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall be subject to the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Public notice and review period.</E> Upon determination by the Common Carrier Bureau that the applicants have filed a complete application and that the application is appropriate for streamlined treatment, the Common Carrier Bureau will issue a public notice stating that the application has been accepted for filing as a streamlined application. Unless otherwise notified by the Commission, an applicant <PRTPAGE P="317"/>is permitted to transfer control of the domestic lines or authorization to operate on the 31st day after the date of public notice listing a domestic section 214 transfer of control application as accepted for filing as a streamlined application, but only in accordance with the operations proposed in its application. Comments on streamlined applications may be filed during the first 14 days following public notice, and reply comments may be filed during the first 21 days following public notice, unless the public notice specifies a different pleading cycle. All comments on streamlined applications shall be filed electronically, and shall satisfy such other filing requirements as may be specified in the public notice.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Presumptive streamlined categories.</E> (1) The streamlined procedures provided in this rule shall be presumed to apply to all transfer of control applications in which:</P>
              <P>(i) Both applicants are non-facilities-based carriers;</P>
              <P>(ii) The transferee is not a telecommunications provider; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The proposed transaction involves only the transfer of the local exchange assets of an incumbent LEC by means other than an acquisition of corporate control.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a proposed transaction would result in a transferee having a market share in the interstate, interexchange market of less than 10 percent, and the transferee would provide competitive telephone exchange services or exchange access services (if at all) exclusively in geographic areas served by a dominant local exchange carrier that is not a party to the transaction, the streamlined procedures provided in this rule shall be presumed to apply to transfer of control applications in which:</P>
              <P>(i) Neither of the applicants is dominant with respect to any service;</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicants are a dominant carrier and a non-dominant carrier that provides services exclusively outside the geographic area where the dominant carrier is dominant; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The applicants are incumbent independent local exchange carriers (as defined in § 64.1902 of this chapter) that have, in combination, fewer than two (2) percent of the nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide, and no overlapping or adjacent service areas.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of (b)(1) and (2) of this paragraph, the terms “applicant,” “carrier,” “party,” and “transferee” (and their plural forms) include any affiliates of such entities within the meaning of section 3(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Removal of application from streamlined processing.</E> (1) At any time after an application is filed, the Commission, acting through the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau, may notify an applicant that its application is being removed from streamlined processing, or will not be subject to streamlined processing. Examples of appropriate circumstances for such action are:</P>
              <P>(i) An application is associated with a non-routine request for waiver of the Commission's rules;</P>
              <P>(ii) An application would, on its face, violate a Commission rule or the Communications Act;</P>
              <P>(iii) An applicant fails to respond promptly to Commission inquiries;</P>
              <P>(iv) Timely-filed comments on the application raise public interest concerns that require further Commission review; or</P>
              <P>(v) The Commission, acting through the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau, otherwise determines that the application requires further analysis to determine whether a proposed transfer of control would serve the public interest.</P>
              <P>(2) Notification will be by public notice that states the reason for removal or non-streamlined treatment, and indicates the expected timeframe for Commission action on the application. Except in extraordinary circumstances, final action on the application should be expected no later than 180 days from public notice that the application has been accepted for filing.</P>

              <P>(d) Pro forma transactions. (1) Any party that would be a domestic common carrier under section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, is authorized to undertake any corporate restructuring, reorganization or liquidation of internal business operations that does not result in a change in ultimate ownership or control of the <PRTPAGE P="318"/>carrier's lines or authorization to operate, including transfers in bankruptcy proceedings to a trustee or to the carrier itself as a debtor-in-possession. <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> Under this rule, a transfer of control of a domestic line or authorization to operate is considered pro forma when, together with all previous internal corporate restructurings, the transaction does not result in a change in the carrier's ultimate ownership or control, or otherwise falls into one of the illustrative categories found in § 63.24 of this part governing transfers of control of international carriers under section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>

                  <SU>1</SU> “Control” includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised and is not limited to majority stock ownership. “Control” also includes direct or indirect ownership or control, such as through intervening subsidiaries. <E T="03">See</E> 47 CFR 63.09.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(2) Any party that would be a domestic common carrier under section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, must notify the Commission no later than 30 days after control of the carrier is transferred to a trustee under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any other party pursuant to any applicable chapter of the Bankruptcy Code when that transfer does not result in a change in ultimate ownership or control of the carrier's lines or authorization to operate. The notification can be in the form of a letter (in duplicate to the Secretary). The letter or other form of notification must also contain the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) in § 63.04. A single letter may be filed for more than one such transfer of control. If a carrier files a discontinuance request within 30 days of the transfer in bankruptcy, the Commission will treat the discontinuance request as sufficient to fulfill the pro forma post-transaction notice requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, any party that would be a domestic common carrier under section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, including a carrier that begins providing service through a differently named subsidiary after an internal corporate restructuring, remains subject to all applicable conditions of service after an internal restructuring, such as rules governing slamming and tariffing.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Foreign carrier</E> is defined as any entity that is authorized within a foreign country to engage in the provision of international telecommunications services offered to the public in that country within the meaning of the International Telecommunication Regulations, see Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference, Melbourne, 1988 (WATTC-88), Art. 1, which includes entities authorized to engage in the provision of domestic telecommunications services if such carriers have the ability to originate or terminate telecommunications services to or from points outside their country.</P>

                <P>Ownership and other interests in U.S. and foreign carriers will be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the following criteria: Attribution of ownership interests in a carrier that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the <PRTPAGE P="320"/>ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain that is equal to or exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. For example, if A owns 30 percent of company X, which owns 60 percent of company Y, which owns 26 percent of “carrier,”' then X's interest in “carrier”' would be 26 percent (the same as Y's interest because X's interest in Y exceeds 50 percent), and A's interest in “carrier”' would be 7.8 percent (0.30 × 0.26 because A's interest in X is less than 50 percent). Under the 25 percent attribution benchmark, X's interest in “carrier”' would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regulatory classification of U.S. international carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Unless otherwise determined by the Commission, any party authorized to provide an international communications service under this part shall be classified as either dominant or non-dominant for the provision of particular international communications services on particular routes as set forth in this section. The rules set forth in this section shall also apply to determinations of regulatory status pursuant to §§ 63.11 and 63.13. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the relevant markets on the foreign end of a U.S. international route include: international transport facilities or services, including cable landing station access and backhaul facilities; inter-city facilities or services; and local access facilities or services on the foreign end of a particular route.</P>
              <P>(1) A U.S. carrier that has no affiliation with, and that itself is not, a foreign carrier in a particular country to which it provides service (i.e., a destination country) shall presumptively be considered non-dominant for the provision of international communications services on that route;</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a U.S. carrier that is, or that has or acquires an affiliation with a foreign carrier that is a monopoly provider of communications services in a relevant market in a destination country shall presumptively be classified as dominant for the provision of international communications services on that route; and</P>
              <P>(3) A U.S. carrier that is, or that has or acquires an affiliation with a foreign carrier that is not a monopoly provider of communications services in a relevant market in a destination country and that seeks to be regulated as non-dominant on that route bears the burden of submitting information to the Commission sufficient to demonstrate that its foreign affiliate lacks sufficient market power on the foreign end of the route to affect competition adversely in the U.S. market. If the U.S. carrier demonstrates that the foreign affiliate lacks 50 percent market share in the international transport and the local access markets on the foreign end of the route, the U.S. carrier shall presumptively be classified as non-dominant.</P>
              <P>(4) A carrier that is authorized under this part to provide to a particular destination an international switched service, and that provides such service solely through the resale of an unaffiliated U.S. facilities-based carrier's international switched services (either directly or indirectly through the resale of another U.S. resale carrier's international switched services), shall presumptively be classified as non-dominant for the provision of the authorized service. A carrier regulated as non-dominant pursuant to this subparagraph shall notify the Commission at any time that it begins to provide such service through the resale of an affiliated U.S. facilities-based carrier's international switched services. The carrier will be deemed a dominant carrier on the route absent a Commission finding that the carrier otherwise qualifies for non-dominant regulation pursuant to this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Any party that seeks to defeat the presumptions in paragraph (a) of this section shall bear the burden of proof upon any issue it raises as to the proper classification of the U.S. carrier.</P>

              <P>(c) Any carrier classified as dominant for the provision of particular services on particular routes under this section <PRTPAGE P="321"/>shall comply with the following requirements in its provision of such services on each such route:</P>
              <P>(1) Provide services as an entity that is separate from its foreign carrier affiliate, in compliance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The authorized carrier shall maintain separate books of account from its affiliated foreign carrier. These separate books of account do not need to comply with part 32 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The authorized carrier shall not jointly own transmission or switching facilities with its affiliated foreign carrier. Nothing in this section prohibits the U.S. carrier from sharing personnel or other resources or assets with its foreign affiliate;</P>
              <P>(2) File quarterly reports on traffic and revenue within 90 days from the end of each calendar quarter. Such reports shall include the minutes completed on foreign networks; settlement payouts for call completion on foreign networks; foreign-billed minutes; and foreign-billed settlement receipts.</P>
              <P>(3) File quarterly reports summarizing the provisioning and maintenance of all basic network facilities and services procured from its foreign carrier affiliate or from an allied foreign carrier, including, but not limited to, those it procures on behalf of customers of any joint venture for the provision of U.S. basic or enhanced services in which the authorized carrier and the foreign carrier participate, within 90 days from the end of each calendar quarter. These reports should contain the following: the types of circuits and services provided; the average time intervals between order and delivery; the number of outages and intervals between fault report and service restoration; and for circuits used to provide international switched service, the percentage of “peak hour” calls that failed to complete;</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of an authorized facilities-based carrier, file quarterly, within 90 days from the end of each calendar quarter, a report of its active and idle 64 kbps or equivalent circuits by facility (terrestrial, satellite and submarine cable).</P>
              <P>(5) If authorized to provide facilities-based service, comply with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) A carrier classified as dominant under this section shall file an original and two copies of each report required by paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section with the Chief, International Bureau. The carrier shall also file one copy of these reports with the Commission's copy contractor. The transmittal letter accompanying each report shall clearly identify the report as responsive to the appropriate paragraph of § 63.10(c).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notification by and prior approval for U.S. international carriers that are or propose to become affiliated with a foreign carrier.</SUBJECT>
              <P>If a carrier is authorized by the Commission (“authorized carrier”) to provide service between the United States and a particular foreign destination market and it becomes, or seeks to become, affiliated with a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate in that market, then its authorization to provide that international service is conditioned upon notifying the Commission of that affiliation.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Affiliations requiring prior notification.</E> Except as provided in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="322"/>(b) of this section, the authorized carrier must notify the Commission, pursuant to this section, forty-five days before consummation of either of the following types of transactions:</P>
              <P>(1) Acquisition by the authorized carrier, or by any entity that controls the authorized carrier, or by any entity that directly or indirectly owns more than twenty-five percent of the capital stock of the authorized carrier, of a controlling interest in a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate in a market that the carrier is authorized to serve; or</P>
              <P>(2) Acquisition of a direct or indirect interest greater than twenty-five percent, or of a controlling interest, in the capital stock of the authorized carrier by a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate in a market that the authorized carrier is authorized to serve, or by an entity that controls such a foreign carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the notification required by this section need not be filed before consummation, and may instead be filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, if either of the following is true with respect to the named foreign carrier regardless of whether that foreign carrier is authorized to operate in a World Trade Organization (WTO) or non-WTO Member:</P>
              <P>(i) The Commission has previously determined in an adjudication that the foreign carrier lacks market power in that destination market (for example, in an international section 214 application or a declaratory ruling proceeding); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The foreign carrier owns no facilities in that destination market. For this purpose, a carrier is said to own facilities if it holds an ownership, indefeasible-right-of-user, or leasehold interest in bare capacity in international or domestic telecommunications facilities (excluding switches).</P>
              <P>(2) In the event paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be satisfied, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the notification required by this section need not be filed before consummation, and may instead be filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, if the authorized carrier certifies that the named foreign carrier is authorized to operate in a WTO Member and provides certification to satisfy either of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The authorized carrier demonstrates that it is entitled to retain non-dominant classification on its newly affiliated route pursuant to § 63.10; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The authorized carrier agrees to comply with the dominant carrier safeguards contained in § 63.10 effective upon the acquisition of the affiliation. See § 63.10.</P>

              <P>(2) In the case of a prior notification filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the U.S. authorized carrier must demonstrate that it continues to serve the public interest for it to operate on the route for which it proposes to acquire an affiliation with the foreign carrier authorized to operate in the non-WTO Member country. Such a showing shall include a demonstration as to whether the foreign carrier lacks market power in the non-WTO Member country with reference to the criteria in § 63.10(a) of this chapter. If the U.S. authorized carrier is unable to make the required showing in § 63.10(a) of this chapter, the U.S. authorized carrier shall agree to comply with the dominant carrier safeguards contained in § 63.10(c) of this chapter, effective upon the acquisition of the affiliation. If the U.S. authorized carrier is notified by the Commission that the affiliation may otherwise harm the public interest pursuant to the Commission's policies and rules, then the Commission may impose conditions necessary to address any public interest harms or may proceed to an immediate authorization revocation hearing.

The public notice of the grant of the authorization shall represent the applicant's Section 214 certificate.</P>
              <P>(c) The streamlined processing procedures provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply where:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant is affiliated with a foreign carrier in a destination market, unless the applicant clearly demonstrates in its application at least one of the following:</P>

Within 90 days of the public notice, the Commission will take action upon the application or provide public notice that, because the application raises questions of extraordinary complexity, an additional 90-day period for review is needed. Each successive 90-day period may be so extended. The application shall not be deemed granted until the Commission affirmatively acts upon the application. Operation for which such authorization is sought may not commence except in accordance with any terms or conditions imposed by the Commission.</P>

                <P>Ownership and other interests in U.S. and foreign carriers will be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the following criteria: Attribution of ownership interests in a carrier that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain that is equal to or exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. For example, if A owns 30 percent of company X, which owns 60 percent of company Y, which owns 26 percent of “carrier,” then X's interest in “carrier” would be 26 percent (the same as Y's interest because X's interest in Y exceeds 50 percent), and A's interest in “carrier” would be 7.8 percent (0.30 × 0.26 because A's interest in X is less than 50 percent). Under the 25 percent attribution benchmark, X's interest in “carrier” would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.</P>

Any such carrier that seeks to retire international facilities, dismantle or remove international trunk lines, but does not discontinue, reduce or impair the dominant services being provided through these facilities, shall only be subject to the notification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If such carrier discontinues, reduces or impairs the dominant service, or retires facilities that impair or reduce the service, the carrier shall file an application pursuant to §§ 63.62 and 63.500.</P>

              <P>International carriers authorized under Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, must follow the following requirements and prohibitions:</P>

              <P>(a) Each carrier is responsible for the continuing accuracy of the certifications made in its application. Whenever the substance of any such certification is no longer accurate, the carrier shall as promptly as possible and, in any event, within thirty (30) days, file with the Commission a corrected certification referencing the FCC file number under which the original certification was provided. The information may be used by the Commission to determine whether a change in regulatory status may be warranted under § 63.10. <E T="03">See also</E> § 63.11.</P>
              <P>(b) Carriers must file copies of operating agreements entered into with their foreign correspondents as specified in § 43.51 of this chapter and shall otherwise comply with the filing requirements contained in that section.</P>
              <P>(c) Carriers regulated as dominant for the provision of a particular international communications service on a particular route for any reason other than a foreign carrier affiliation under § 63.10 shall file tariffs pursuant to Section 203 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 203, and part 61 of this chapter. Except as specified in § 20.15(d) of this chapter with respect to commercial mobile radio service providers, carriers regulated as non-dominant, as defined in § 61.3 of this chapter, and providing detariffed international services pursuant to § 61.19 of this chapter must comply with all applicable public disclosure and maintenance of information requirements in §§ 42.10 and 42.11 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) Authorized carriers may not access or make use of specific U.S. customer proprietary network information that is derived from a foreign network unless the carrier obtains approval from that U.S. customer. In seeking to obtain approval, the carrier must notify the U.S. customer that the customer may require the carrier to disclose the information to unaffiliated third parties upon written request by the customer.</P>
              <P>(f) Authorized carriers may not receive from a foreign carrier any proprietary or confidential information pertaining to a competing U.S. carrier, obtained by the foreign carrier in the course of its normal business dealings, unless the competing U.S. carrier provides its permission in writing.</P>
              <P>(g) The Commission reserves the right to review a carrier's authorization, and, if warranted, impose additional requirements on U.S. international carriers in circumstances where it appears that harm to competition is occurring on one or more U.S. international routes.</P>

              <P>(h) Subject to the requirement of § 63.10 that a carrier regulated as dominant along a route must provide service as an entity that is separate from its foreign carrier affiliate, and subject to any other structural-separation requirement in Commission regulations, an authorized carrier may provide service through any wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries. The carrier must, within thirty (30) days after the subsidiary begins providing service, file with the Commission a notification referencing the authorized carrier's name and the FCC file numbers under which the carrier's authorizations were granted and identifying the subsidiary's name and place of legal organization. This provision shall not be construed to authorize the provision of service by any entity barred by statute <PRTPAGE P="331"/>or regulation from itself holding an authorization or providing service.</P>
              <P>(i) An authorized carrier, or a subsidiary operating pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, that changes its name (including the name under which it is doing business) must notify the Commission within thirty (30) days of the name change. Such notification shall reference the FCC file numbers under which the carrier's authorizations were granted.</P>

              <P>The following conditions apply to authorized facilities-based international carriers:</P>
              <P>(a) A carrier authorized under § 63.18(e)(1) may provide international facilities-based services to international points for which it qualifies for non-dominant regulation as set forth in § 63.10, except in the following circumstance: If the carrier is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier in a destination market and the Commission has not determined that the foreign carrier lacks market power in the destination market (see § 63.10(a)), the carrier shall not provide service on that route unless it has received specific authority to do so under § 63.18(e)(3).</P>

              <P>(b) The carrier may provide service using half-circuits on any U.S. common carrier and non-common carrier facilities that do not appear on an exclusion list published by the Commission. Carriers may also use any necessary non-U.S.-licensed facilities, including any submarine cable systems, that do not appear on the exclusion list. Carriers may not use U.S. earth stations to access non-U.S.-licensed satellite systems unless the Commission has specifically approved the use of those satellites and so indicates on the exclusion list. The exclusion list is available from the International Bureau's World Wide Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fcc.gov/ib.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) Specific authority under § 63.18(e)(3) is required for the carrier to provide service using any facilities listed on the exclusion list, to provide service between the United States and any country on the exclusion list, or to construct, acquire, or operate lines in any new major common carrier facility project.</P>
              <P>(d) The carrier may provide international basic switched, private line, data, television and business services.</P>
              <P>(e) The carrier shall file annual international circuit capacity reports as required by § 43.82 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(f) The terms and conditions of any operating or other agreement relating to the exchange of services, interchange or routing of traffic and matters concerning rates, accounting rates, division of tolls, the allocation of return traffic, or the basis of settlement of traffic balances, entered into by U.S. common carriers authorized pursuant to this part to provide facilities-based switched voice service on the U.S.-Cuba route in correspondence with a Cuban carrier that does not qualify for the presumption that it lacks market power in Cuba, shall be identical to the equivalent terms and conditions in the operating agreement of another carrier providing the same or similar service between the United States and Cuba. Carriers may seek waiver of this requirement. <E T="03">See International Settlements Policy Reform,</E> Report and Order, IB Docket Nos. 11-80, 05-254, 09-10, RM 11322, FCC 12-145 (rel. November 29, 2012).</P>

              <P>(g) A carrier or other party may request Commission intervention on any U.S. international route for which competitive problems are alleged by filing with the International Bureau a petition, pursuant to this section, demonstrating anticompetitive behavior by foreign carriers that is harmful to U.S. <PRTPAGE P="332"/>customers. The Commission may also act on its own motion. Carriers and other parties filing complaints must support their petitions with evidence, including an affidavit and relevant commercial agreements. The International Bureau will review complaints on a case-by-case basis and take appropriate action on delegated authority pursuant to § 0.261 of this chapter. Interested parties will have 10 days from the date of issuance of a public notice of the petition to file comments or oppositions to such petitions and subsequently 7 days for replies. In the event significant, immediate harm to the public interest is likely to occur that cannot be addressed through <E T="03">post facto</E> remedies, the International Bureau may impose temporary requirements on carriers authorized pursuant to § 63.18 of this chapter without prejudice to its findings on such petitions.</P>
              <P>(h) A carrier shall file with the Commission a list of U.S.-international routes for which it has an arrangement with a foreign carrier for direct termination in the foreign destination. The carrier shall notify the Commission within 30 days after it adds a termination arrangement for a new foreign destination or discontinues arrangements with a previously listed destination. The list shall be filed electronically in accordance with instructions from the International Bureau.</P>

              <P>(i) The authority granted under this part is subject to all Commission rules and regulations and any conditions or limitations stated in the Commission's public notice or order that serves as the carrier's Section 214 certificate. See §§ 63.12, 63.21 of this part.

              <P>(a) A carrier authorized under § 63.18(e)(2) may provide resold international services to international points for which the applicant qualifies for non-dominant regulation as set forth in § 63.10, except that the carrier may not provide either of the following services unless it has received specific authority to do so under § 63.18(e)(3):</P>
              <P>(1) Resold switched services to a non-WTO Member country where the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier; and</P>
              <P>(2) Switched or private line services over resold private lines to a destination market where the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier and the Commission has not determined that the foreign carrier lacks market power in the destination market (see § 63.10(a)).</P>
              <P>(b) The carrier may not resell the international services of an affiliated carrier regulated as dominant on the route to be served unless it has received specific authority to do so under § 63.18(e)(3).</P>

              <P>(c) Subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (b) of this section and in § 63.17(b), the carrier may provide <PRTPAGE P="333"/>service by reselling the international services of any other authorized U.S. common carrier or foreign carrier, or by entering into a roaming or other arrangement with a foreign carrier, for the provision of international basic switched, private line, data, television and business services to all international points.

                <P>For purposes of this paragraph, a roaming arrangement with a foreign carrier is defined as an arrangement under which the subscribers of a U.S. commercial mobile radio service provider use the facilities of a foreign carrier with which the subscriber has no direct pre-existing service or financial relationship to place a call from the foreign country to the United States.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(d) The carrier may provide switched basic services over its authorized resold private lines in either of the following two circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) The country at the foreign end of the private line appears on the Commission's list of international routes exempted from the international settlements policy set forth in § 64.1002 of this chapter; or</P>

              <P>(2) The carrier is exchanging switched traffic with a foreign carrier that lacks market power in the country at the foreign end of the private line. A foreign carrier lacks market power for purposes of this section if it does not appear on the Commission's list of foreign carriers that do not qualify for the presumption that they lack market power in particular foreign points.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, an international section 214 authorization may be assigned, or control of such authorization may be transferred by the transfer of control of any entity holding such authorization, to another party, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, only upon application to and prior approval by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Assignments.</E> For purposes of this section, an assignment of an authorization is a transaction in which the authorization is assigned from one entity to another entity. Following an assignment, the authorization is held by an entity other than the one to which it was originally granted.
              </P>

                <P>The sale of a customer base, or a portion of a customer base, by a carrier to another carrier, is a sale of assets and shall be treated as an assignment, which requires prior Commission approval under this section.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transfers of control.</E> For purposes of this section, a transfer of control is a transaction in which the authorization remains held by the same entity, but there is a change in the entity or entities that control the authorization holder. A change from less than 50 percent ownership to 50 percent or more ownership shall always be considered a transfer of control. A change from 50 percent or more ownership to less than 50 percent ownership shall always be considered a transfer of control. In all other situations, whether the interest being transferred is controlling must be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the factors listed in Note to paragraph (c).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Pro forma assignments and transfers of control.</E> Transfers of control or assignments that do not result in a change in the actual controlling party are considered non-substantial or pro forma. Whether there has been a change in the actual controlling party must be determined on a case-by-case <PRTPAGE P="334"/>basis with reference to the factors listed in Note 1 to this paragraph (d). The types of transactions listed in Note 2 to this paragraph (d) shall be considered presumptively pro forma and prior approval from the Commission need not be sought.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note 1 to paragraph (<E T="01">d</E>):</HD>
                <P>Because the issue of control inherently involves issues of fact, it must be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary with the circumstances presented by each case. The factors relevant to a determination of control in addition to equity ownership include, but are not limited to the following: power to constitute or appoint more than fifty percent of the board of directors or partnership management committee; authority to appoint, promote, demote and fire senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the licensee; ability to play an integral role in major management decisions of the licensee; authority to pay financial obligations, including expenses arising out of operations; ability to receive monies and profits from the facility's operations; and unfettered use of all facilities and equipment.</P>

                <P>If a transaction is one of the types listed further, the transaction is presumptively pro forma and prior approval need not be sought. In all other cases, the relevant determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis. Assignment from an individual or individuals (including partnerships) to a corporation owned and controlled by such individuals or partnerships without any substantial change in their relative interests; Assignment from a corporation to its individual stockholders without effecting any substantial change in the disposition of their interests; Assignment or transfer by which certain stockholders retire and the interest transferred is not a controlling one; Corporate reorganization that involves no substantial change in the beneficial ownership of the corporation (including re-incorporation in a different jurisdiction or change in form of the business entity); Assignment or transfer from a corporation to a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary thereof or vice versa, or where there is an assignment from a corporation to a corporation owned or controlled by the assignor stockholders without substantial change in their interests; or Assignment of less than a controlling interest in a partnership.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applications for substantial transactions.</E> (1) In the case of an assignment or transfer of control shall of an international section 214 authorization that is not pro forma, the proposed assignee or transferee must apply to the Commission for authority prior to consummation of the proposed assignment or transfer of control.</P>
              <P>(2) The application shall include the information requested in paragraphs (a) through (d) of § 63.18 for both the transferor/assignor and the transferee/assignee. The information requested in paragraphs (h) through (p) of § 63.18 is required only for the transferee/assignee. At the beginning of the application, the applicant shall include a narrative of the means by which the proposed transfer or assignment will take place.</P>
              <P>(3) The Commission reserves the right to request additional information as to the particulars of the transaction to aid it in making its public interest determination.</P>
              <P>(4) An assignee or transferee must notify the Commission no later than thirty (30) days after either consummation of the proposed assignment or transfer of control, or a decision not to consummate the proposed assignment or transfer of control. The notification shall identify the file numbers under which the initial authorization and the authorization of the assignment or transfer of control were granted.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notifications for non-substantial or pro forma transactions.</E> (1) In the case of a pro forma assignment or transfer of control, the section 214 authorization holder is not required to seek prior Commission approval.</P>
              <P>(2) A <E T="03">pro forma</E> assignee or a carrier that is subject to a <E T="03">pro forma</E> transfer of control must file a notification with the Commission no later than thirty (30) days after the assignment or transfer is completed. The notification must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The information requested in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of § 63.18 for the transferee/assignee;</P>
              <P>(ii) A certification that the transfer of control or assignment was pro forma and that, together with all previous pro forma transactions, does not result in a change in the actual controlling party.</P>

              <P>(3) A single notification may be filed for an assignment or transfer of control of more than one authorization if each authorization is identified by the file number under which it was granted.<PRTPAGE P="335"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Upon release of a public notice granting a pro forma assignment or transfer of control, petitions for reconsideration under § 1.106 of this chapter or applications for review under § 1.115 of this chapter of the Commission's rules may be filed within 30 days. Petitioner should address why the assignment or transfer of control in question should have been filed under paragraph (e) of this section rather than under this paragraph (f).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Involuntary assignments or transfers of control.</E> In the case of an involuntary assignment or transfer of control to: a bankruptcy trustee appointed under involuntary bankruptcy; an independent receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in a foreclosure action; or, in the case of death or legal disability, to a person or entity legally qualified to succeed the deceased or disabled person under the laws of the place having jurisdiction over the estate involved; the applicant must make the appropriate filing no later than 30 days after the event causing the involuntary assignment or transfer of control.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Restrictions on indecent telephone message services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is a defense to prosecution for the provision of indecent communications under section 223(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), 47 U.S.C. 223(b)(2), that the defendant has taken the action set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and, in addition, has complied with the following: Taken one of the actions set forth in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), or (4) of this section to restrict access to prohibited communications to persons eighteen years of age or older, and has additionally complied with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, where applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Has notified the common carrier identified in section 223(c)(1) of the Act, in writing, that he or she is providing the kind of service described in section 223(b)(2) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) Requires payment by credit card before transmission of the message; or</P>
              <P>(3) Requires an authorized access or identification code before transmission of the message, and where the defendant has:</P>

              <P>(i) Issued the code by mailing it to the applicant after reasonably ascertaining through receipt of a written application that the applicant is not under eighteen years of age; and<PRTPAGE P="354"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Established a procedure to cancel immediately the code of any person upon written, telephonic or other notice to the defendant's business office that such code has been lost, stolen, or used by a person or persons under the age of eighteen, or that such code is no longer desired; or</P>
              <P>(4) Scrambles the message using any technique that renders the audio unintelligible and incomprehensible to the calling party unless that party uses a descrambler; and,</P>
              <P>(5) Where the defendant is a message sponsor subscriber to mass announcement services tariffed at this Commission and such defendant prior to the transmission of the message has requested in writing to the carrier providing the public announcement service that calls to this message service be subject to billing notification as an adult telephone message service.</P>
              <P>(b) A common carrier within the District of Columbia or within any State, or in interstate or foreign commerce, shall not, to the extent technically feasible, provide access to a communication described in section 223(b) of the Act from the telephone of any subscriber who has not previously requested in writing the carrier to provide access to such communication if the carrier collects from subscribers an identifiable charge for such communication that the carrier remits, in whole or in part, to the provider of such communication.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mandatory minimum standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The standards in this section are applicable December 18, 2000, except as stated in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Operational standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Communications assistant (CA).</E> (i) TRS providers are responsible for requiring that all CAs be sufficiently trained to effectively meet the specialized communications needs of individuals with hearing and speech disabilities.</P>
              <P>(ii) CAs must have competent skills in typing, grammar, spelling, interpretation of typewritten ASL, and familiarity with hearing and speech disability cultures, languages and etiquette. CAs must possess clear and articulate voice communications.</P>
              <P>(iii) CAs must provide a typing speed of a minimum of 60 words per minute. Technological aids may be used to reach the required typing speed. Providers must give oral-to-type tests of CA speed.</P>

              <P>(iv) TRS providers are responsible for requiring that VRS CAs are qualified interpreters. A “qualified interpreter” <PRTPAGE P="359"/>is able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary.</P>
              <P>(v) CAs answering and placing a TTY-based TRS or VRS call shall stay with the call for a minimum of ten minutes. CAs answering and placing an STS call shall stay with the call for a minimum of twenty minutes. The minimum time period shall begin to run when the CA reaches the called party. The obligation of the CA to stay with the call shall terminate upon the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(A) The termination of the call by one of the parties to the call; or</P>
              <P>(B) The completion of the minimum time period.</P>
              <P>(vi) TRS providers must make best efforts to accommodate a TRS user's requested CA gender when a call is initiated and, if a transfer occurs, at the time the call is transferred to another CA.</P>
              <P>(vii) TRS shall transmit conversations between TTY and voice callers in real time.</P>
              <P>(viii) STS providers shall offer STS users the option to have their voices muted so that the other party to the call will hear only the CA and will not hear the STS user's voice.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Confidentiality and conversation content.</E> (i) Except as authorized by section 705 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 605, CAs are prohibited from disclosing the content of any relayed conversation regardless of content, and with a limited exception for STS CAs, from keeping records of the content of any conversation beyond the duration of a call, even if to do so would be inconsistent with state or local law. STS CAs may retain information from a particular call in order to facilitate the completion of consecutive calls, at the request of the user. The caller may request the STS CA to retain such information, or the CA may ask the caller if he wants the CA to repeat the same information during subsequent calls. The CA may retain the information only for as long as it takes to complete the subsequent calls.</P>
              <P>(ii) CAs are prohibited from intentionally altering a relayed conversation and, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with federal, state or local law regarding use of telephone company facilities for illegal purposes, must relay all conversation verbatim unless the relay user specifically requests summarization, or if the user requests interpretation of an ASL call. An STS CA may facilitate the call of an STS user with a speech disability so long as the CA does not interfere with the independence of the user, the user maintains control of the conversation, and the user does not object. Appropriate measures must be taken by relay providers to ensure that confidentiality of VRS users is maintained.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Types of calls.</E> (i) Consistent with the obligations of telecommunications carrier operators, CAs are prohibited from refusing single or sequential calls or limiting the length of calls utilizing relay services.</P>

              <P>(ii) Relay services shall be capable of handling any type of call normally provided by telecommunications carriers unless the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible to do so. Relay service providers have the burden of proving the infeasibility of handling any type of call. Providers of Internet-based TRS need not provide the same billing options (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sent-paid long distance, operator-assisted, collect, and third party billing) traditionally offered for wireline voice services if they allow for long distance calls to be placed using calling cards or credit cards or do not assess charges for long distance calling. Providers of Internet-based TRS need not allow for long distance calls to be placed using calling cards or credit cards if they do not assess charges for long distance calling.</P>
              <P>(iii) Relay service providers are permitted to decline to complete a call because credit authorization is denied.</P>
              <P>(iv) Relay services other than Internet-based TRS shall be capable of handling pay-per-call calls.</P>
              <P>(v) TRS providers are required to provide the following types of TRS calls:</P>
              <P>(A) Text-to-voice and voice-to-text;</P>
              <P>(B) One-line VCO, two-line VCO, VCO-to-TTY, and VCO-to-VCO; and</P>

              <P>(C) One-line HCO, two-line HCO, HCO-to-TTY, HCO-to-HCO. VRS providers are not required to provide text-to-voice and voice-to-text functionality. IP Relay providers are not required to provide one-line VCO <PRTPAGE P="360"/>and one-line HCO. IP Relay providers and VRS providers are not required to provide:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) VCO-to-TTY and VCO-to-VCO; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) HCO-to-TTY and HCO-to-HCO. Captioned telephone service providers and IP CTS providers are not required to provide:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Text-to-voice functionality; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) One-line HCO, two-line HCO, HCO-to-TTY, and HCO-to-HCO. IP CTS providers are not required to provide one-line VCO.</P>
              <P>(vi) TRS providers are required to provide the following features:</P>
              <P>(A) Call release functionality (only with respect to the provision of TTY-based relay service);</P>
              <P>(B) Speed dialing functionality; and</P>
              <P>(C) Three-way calling functionality.</P>
              <P>(vii) Voice mail and interactive menus. CAs must alert the TRS user to the presence of a recorded message and interactive menu through a hot key on the CA's terminal. The hot key will send text from the CA to the consumer's TTY indicating that a recording or interactive menu has been encountered. Relay providers shall electronically capture recorded messages and retain them for the length of the call. Relay providers may not impose any charges for additional calls, which must be made by the relay user in order to complete calls involving recorded or interactive messages.</P>
              <P>(viii) TRS providers shall provide, as TRS features, answering machine and voice mail retrieval.</P>
              <P>(4) Emergency call handling requirements for TTY-based TRS providers. TTY-based TRS providers must use a system for incoming emergency calls that, at a minimum, automatically and immediately transfers the caller to an appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). An appropriate PSAP is either a PSAP that the caller would have reached if he had dialed 911 directly, or a PSAP that is capable of enabling the dispatch of emergency services to the caller in an expeditious manner.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">STS called numbers.</E> Relay providers must offer STS users the option to maintain at the relay center a list of names and telephone numbers which the STS user calls. When the STS user requests one of these names, the CA must repeat the name and state the telephone number to the STS user. This information must be transferred to any new STS provider.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Visual privacy screens/idle calls.</E> A VRS CA may not enable a visual privacy screen or similar feature during a VRS call. A VRS CA must disconnect a VRS call if the caller or the called party to a VRS call enables a privacy screen or similar feature for more than five minutes or is otherwise unresponsive or unengaged for more than five minutes, unless the call is a 9-1-1 emergency call or the caller or called party is legitimately placed on hold and is present and waiting for active communications to commence. Prior to disconnecting the call, the CA must announce to both parties the intent to terminate the call and may reverse the decision to disconnect if one of the parties indicates continued engagement with the call.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">International calls.</E> VRS calls that originate from an international IP address will not be compensated, with the exception of calls made by a U.S. resident who has pre-registered with his or her default provider prior to leaving the country, during specified periods of time while on travel and from specified regions of travel, for which there is an accurate means of verifying the identity and location of such callers. For purposes of this section, an international IP address is defined as one that indicates that the individual initiating the call is located outside the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">ASCII and Baudot.</E> TTY-based relay service shall be capable of communicating with ASCII and Baudot format, at any speed generally in use. Other forms of TRS are not subject to this requirement.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Speed of answer.</E> (i) TRS providers shall ensure adequate TRS facility staffing to provide callers with efficient access under projected calling volumes, so that the probability of a busy response due to CA unavailability shall be functionally equivalent to what a voice caller would experience in attempting to reach a party through the voice telephone network.</P>

              <P>(ii) TRS facilities shall, except during network failure, answer 85% of all calls within 10 seconds by any method <PRTPAGE P="361"/>which results in the caller's call immediately being placed, not put in a queue or on hold. The ten seconds begins at the time the call is delivered to the TRS facility's network. A TRS facility shall ensure that adequate network facilities shall be used in conjunction with TRS so that under projected calling volume the probability of a busy response due to loop trunk congestion shall be functionally equivalent to what a voice caller would experience in attempting to reach a party through the voice telephone network.</P>
              <P>(A) The call is considered delivered when the TRS facility's equipment accepts the call from the local exchange carrier (LEC) and the public switched network actually delivers the call to the TRS facility.</P>
              <P>(B) Abandoned calls shall be included in the speed-of-answer calculation.</P>
              <P>(C) A TRS provider's compliance with this rule shall be measured on a daily basis.</P>
              <P>(D) The system shall be designed to a P.01 standard.</P>
              <P>(E) A LEC shall provide the call attempt rates and the rates of calls blocked between the LEC and the TRS facility to relay administrators and TRS providers upon request.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Speed of answer requirements for VRS providers.</E> VRS providers must answer 80% of all VRS calls within 120 seconds, measured on a monthly basis. VRS providers must meet the speed of answer requirements for VRS providers as measured from the time a VRS call reaches facilities operated by the VRS provider to the time when the call is answered by a CA—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> not when the call is put on hold, placed in a queue, or connected to an IVR system. Abandoned calls shall be included in the VRS speed of answer calculation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Equal access to interexchange carriers.</E> TRS users shall have access to their chosen interexchange carrier through the TRS, and to all other operator services to the same extent that such access is provided to voice users. This requirement is inapplicable to providers of Internet-based TRS if they do not assess specific charges for long distance calling.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">TRS facilities.</E> (i) TRS shall operate every day, 24 hours a day. Relay services that are not mandated by this Commission need not be provided every day, 24 hours a day, except VRS.</P>
              <P>(ii) TRS shall have redundancy features functionally equivalent to the equipment in normal central offices, including uninterruptible power for emergency use.</P>
              <P>(iii) A VRS CA may not handle VRS calls from a location primarily used as his or her home unless as part of the voluntary at-home VRS call handling pilot program as provided for by paragraph (b)(8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) A VRS provider leasing or licensing an automatic call distribution (ACD) platform must have a written lease or license agreement. Such lease or license agreement may not include any revenue sharing agreement or compensation based upon minutes of use. In addition, if any such lease is between two eligible VRS providers, the lessee or licensee must locate the ACD platform on its own premises and must utilize its own employees to manage the ACD platform.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Technology.</E> No regulation set forth in this subpart is intended to discourage or impair the development of improved technology that fosters the availability of telecommunications to person with disabilities. TRS facilities are permitted to use SS7 technology or any other type of similar technology to enhance the functional equivalency and quality of TRS. TRS facilities that utilize SS7 technology shall be subject to the Calling Party Telephone Number rules set forth at 47 CFR 64.1600 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Caller ID.</E> When a TRS facility is able to transmit any calling party identifying information to the public network, the TRS facility must pass through, to the called party, at least one of the following: the number of the TRS facility, 711, or the 10-digit number of the calling party.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">STS 711 Calls.</E> An STS provider shall, at a minimum, employ the same means of enabling an STS user to connect to a CA when dialing 711 that the provider uses for all other forms of TRS. When a CA directly answers an incoming 711 call, the CA shall transfer the STS user to an STS CA without requiring the STS user to take any additional steps. When an interactive voice response (IVR) system answers an incoming 711 call, the IVR system shall <PRTPAGE P="362"/>allow for an STS user to connect directly to an STS CA using the same level of prompts as the IVR system uses for all other forms of TRS.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Voluntary at-home VRS call handling pilot program.</E> Any VRS provider that holds a conditional or full certification to receive compensation from the TRS Fund pursuant to § 64.606 as of March 23, 2017 may participate in the voluntary at-home VRS call handling pilot program. The pilot program shall be in effect for one year, for service provided by participants beginning November 1, 2017, and ending October 31, 2018.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Notification of intent to participate.</E> A VRS provider seeking to participate in the pilot program shall notify the Commission of its intent to participate on or before September 1, 2017, and shall include in such notification a detailed plan demonstrating that the VRS provider intends to achieve compliance with the mandatory minimum standards applicable to VRS and with the safeguards enumerated in this paragraph (b)(8). Plans submitted by VRS providers shall specify the following:</P>
              <P>(A) A description of the screening process used to select CAs for the at-home call handling program;</P>
              <P>(B) A description of specific training to be provided for at-home CAs;</P>

              <P>(D) A description of the grounds for dismissing a CA from the at-home program and the process for such termination in the event that the CA fails to adhere to applicable requirements;</P>
              <P>(E) A description of all steps that will be taken to install a workstation in a CA's home, including evaluations that will be performed to ensure all workstations are sufficiently secure and equipped to prevent eavesdropping and outside interruptions;</P>
              <P>(F) A description of the monitoring technology to be used by the provider to ensure that off-site supervision approximates the level of supervision at the provider's call center;</P>
              <P>(G) An explanation of how the provider's workstations will connect to the provider's network, including how they will be integrated into the call center routing, distribution, tracking, and support systems, and how the provider will ensure system redundancy in the event of service disruptions in at-home workstations;</P>
              <P>(H) A signed certification by an officer of the provider that the provider will conduct random and unannounced inspections of at least five percent (5%) of all at-home workstations during the pilot program; and</P>
              <P>(I) A commitment to comply with all other safeguards enumerated in this paragraph (b)(8) and the applicable rules in this chapter governing TRS.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Authorization for at-home VRS call handling.</E> Upon Commission approval of a VRS provider's plan, the provider may conduct at-home VRS call handling during the period of the pilot program. The Commission may cancel such approval if a VRS provider fails to comply with any of the safeguards enumerated in this paragraph (b)(8) or other applicable mandatory minimum TRS standards. VRS providers may be subject to withholding, forfeitures, and penalties for noncompliant minutes handled by at-home workstations, as is the case for non-compliant minutes handled by call centers.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limit on minutes handled.</E> In any month of the program, a VRS provider may be compensated for minutes served by at-home CA workstations up to a maximum of <E T="03">either</E> thirty percent (30%) of a VRS provider's total minutes for which compensation is paid in that month <E T="03">or</E> thirty percent (30%) of the provider's average monthly minutes for the 12 months ending October 31, 2017, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Personnel safeguards.</E> Before permitting CAs to handle VRS calls from at-home workstations, VRS providers shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Ensure that each CA handling calls from an at-home workstation has the experience, skills, and knowledge necessary to effectively interpret from these workstations, including a thorough understanding of the TRS mandatory minimum standards and at least three years of experience as a call center CA.</P>

              <P>(B) Establish protocols for the handling of calls from at-home workstations (to the extent there are additional protocols that differ from <PRTPAGE P="363"/>those applicable to the provider's call centers) and provide training to at-home CAs on such protocols, in addition to all applicable training that is required of CAs working from call centers.</P>
              <P>(C) Provide each CA working from an at-home workstation equivalent support to that provided to CAs working from call centers, as needed to effectively handle calls, including, where appropriate, the opportunity to team interpret and consult with supervisors, and ensure that supervisors are readily available to a CA working from home to resolve problems that may arise during a relay call, such as difficulty in understanding a VRS user's signs, the need for added support for emergency calls, and relieving a CA in the event of the CA's sudden illness.</P>

              <P>(D) Establish grounds for dismissing a CA from the at-home VRS call handling program (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> for noncompliance with the standards and safeguards enumerated in this paragraph (b)(8) and the rules governing TRS), including a process for such termination in the event that the CA fails to adhere to these requirements, and provide such grounds and process in writing to each CA participating in the pilot program.</P>
              <P>(E) Obtain from each CA handling calls from an at-home workstation a certification in writing of the CA's understanding of and commitment to complying with the rules in this chapter governing TRS, including rules governing caller confidentiality and fraud prevention, and the CA's understanding of the reasons and process for dismissal from the at-home VRS call handling program.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Technical and environmental safeguards.</E> Participating VRS providers shall ensure that each home environment used for at-home VRS call handling enables the provision of confidential and uninterrupted services to the same extent as the provider's call centers and is seamlessly integrated into the provider's call routing, distribution, tracking, and support systems. VRS providers shall ensure that each at-home workstation:</P>
              <P>(A) Resides in a separate, secure location in the CA's home, where access is restricted solely to the CA;</P>
              <P>(B) Allows a CA to use all call-handling technology to the same extent as other CAs, including the ability to transition a non-emergency call to an emergency call, engage in virtual teaming with another CA, and allow supervisors to communicate with and oversee calls;</P>
              <P>(C) Is capable of supporting VRS in compliance with the applicable mandatory minimum technical and emergency call handling standards to the same degree as these are available at call centers, including the ability to route VRS calls around individual CA workstations in the event the CA experiences a network outage or other service interruption;</P>
              <P>(D) Is equipped with an effective means to prevent eavesdropping, such as white noise emitters or soundproofing, and to ensure that interruptions from noises outside the room do not adversely affect a CA's ability to interpret a call accurately and effectively; and</P>
              <P>(E) Is connected to the provider's network over a secure connection to ensure caller privacy.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Monitoring and oversight obligations.</E> VRS providers shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Inspect and approve each at-home workstation before activating a CA's workstation for use;</P>
              <P>(B) Assign a unique call center identification number (ID) to each VRS at-home workstation and use this call center ID to identify all minutes handled from each such workstation in its call detail records submitted monthly to the TRS Fund administrator;</P>

              <P>(C) Equip each at-home workstation with monitoring technology sufficient to ensure that off-site supervision approximates the level of supervision at the provider's call center, including the ability to monitor both ends of a call, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> video and audio, to the same extent as is possible in a call center, and regularly analyze the records and data produced by such monitoring to proactively address possible waste, fraud, and abuse;</P>

              <P>(D) Keep all records pertaining to at-home workstations, including the data produced by any at-home workstation monitoring technology, except for any <PRTPAGE P="364"/>data that records the content of an interpreted conversation, for a minimum of five years; and</P>
              <P>(E) Conduct random and unannounced inspections of at least five percent (5%) of all at-home workstations during the pilot program.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Commission audits and inspections.</E> At-home workstations and workstation records shall be subject to review, audit, and inspection by the Commission and the Fund administrator and unannounced on-site inspections by the Commission to the same extent as other call centers and call center records subject to the rules in this chapter.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Monthly reports.</E> Each participating VRS provider shall report the following information to the TRS Fund administrator with its monthly requests for compensation:</P>
              <P>(A) The call center ID and full street address (number, street, city, state, and zip code) for each at-home workstation and the CA ID number for each individual handling VRS calls from that workstation; and</P>
              <P>(B) The location and call center IDs of call centers providing supervision for at-home workstations, plus the names of persons at such call centers responsible for oversight of such workstations.</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">Six-month report.</E> Each participating VRS provider shall submit, no later than seven months after the start of its program, a report covering the first six months of its program, containing the following information:</P>
              <P>(A) A description of the actual screening process used to select CAs for the at-home call handling program;</P>
              <P>(B) Copies of training materials provided to at-home CAs;</P>
              <P>(C) Copies of written protocols used for CAs working from home;</P>
              <P>(D) The total number of CAs handling VRS calls from at-home workstations over the first six months of the program;</P>

              <P>(G) The total number of CAs terminated from the program;</P>
              <P>(H) The total number of complaints, if any, submitted to the provider regarding its at-home call handling program or calls handled by at-home CAs;</P>
              <P>(I) The total number of on-site inspections conducted of at-home workstations and the date and location of each inspection;</P>
              <P>(J) A description of the monitoring technology used to monitor CAs working at home and an analysis of the experience of supervisors overseeing at-home CAs compared to overseeing CAs in a call center;</P>
              <P>(K) Copies of any reports produced by tracking software and a description explaining how the provider analyzed the reports for anomalies; and</P>
              <P>(L) Detailed documentation of costs incurred in the use of at-home workstations, including any costs associated with CA recruitment, training, and compensation, engineering and technical set-up (including workstation set-up), and administrative and management support (including oversight, evaluation, and recording).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Functional standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Consumer complaint logs.</E> (i) States and interstate providers must maintain a log of consumer complaints including all complaints about TRS in the state, whether filed with the TRS provider or the State, and must retain the log until the next application for certification is granted. The log shall include, at a minimum, the date the complaint was filed, the nature of the complaint, the date of resolution, and an explanation of the resolution.</P>
              <P>(ii) Beginning July 1, 2002, states and TRS providers shall submit summaries of logs indicating the number of complaints received for the 12-month period ending May 31 to the Commission by July 1 of each year. Summaries of logs submitted to the Commission on July 1, 2001 shall indicate the number of complaints received from the date of OMB approval through May 31, 2001.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Contact persons.</E> Beginning on June 30, 2000, State TRS Programs, interstate TRS providers, and TRS providers that have state contracts must submit to the Commission a contact person and/or office for TRS consumer <PRTPAGE P="365"/>information and complaints about a certified State TRS Program's provision of intrastate TRS, or, as appropriate, about the TRS provider's service. This submission must include, at a minimum, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The name and address of the office that receives complaints, grievances, inquiries, and suggestions;</P>
              <P>(ii) Voice and TTY telephone numbers, fax number, e-mail address, and web address; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The physical address to which correspondence should be sent.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Public access to information.</E> Carriers, through publication in their directories, periodic billing inserts, placement of TRS instructions in telephone directories, through directory assistance services, and incorporation of TTY numbers in telephone directories, shall assure that callers in their service areas are aware of the availability and use of all forms of TRS. Efforts to educate the public about TRS should extend to all segments of the public, including individuals who are hard of hearing, speech disabled, and senior citizens as well as members of the general population. In addition, each common carrier providing telephone voice transmission services shall conduct, not later than October 1, 2001, ongoing education and outreach programs that publicize the availability of 711 access to TRS in a manner reasonably designed to reach the largest number of consumers possible.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Rates.</E> TRS users shall pay rates no greater than the rates paid for functionally equivalent voice communication services with respect to such factors as the duration of the call, the time of day, and the distance from the point of origination to the point of termination.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Jurisdictional separation of costs</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Where appropriate, costs of providing TRS shall be separated in accordance with the jurisdictional separation procedures and standards set forth in the Commission's regulations adopted pursuant to section 410 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cost recovery.</E> Costs caused by interstate TRS shall be recovered from all subscribers for every interstate service, utilizing a shared-funding cost recovery mechanism. Except as noted in this paragraph, with respect to VRS, costs caused by intrastate TRS shall be recovered from the intrastate jurisdiction. In a state that has a certified program under § 64.606, the state agency providing TRS shall, through the state's regulatory agency, permit a common carrier to recover costs incurred in providing TRS by a method consistent with the requirements of this section. Costs caused by the provision of interstate and intrastate VRS shall be recovered from all subscribers for every interstate service, utilizing a shared-funding cost recovery mechanism.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Telecommunications Relay Services Fund.</E> Effective July 26, 1993, an Interstate Cost Recovery Plan, hereinafter referred to as the TRS Fund, shall be administered by an entity selected by the Commission (administrator). The initial administrator, for an interim period, will be the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Contributions.</E> Every carrier providing interstate telecommunications services (including interconnected VoIP service providers pursuant to § 64.601(b)) and every provider of non-interconnected VoIP service shall contribute to the TRS Fund on the basis of interstate end-user revenues as described herein. Contributions shall be made by all carriers who provide interstate services, including, but not limited to, cellular telephone and paging, mobile radio, operator services, personal communications service (PCS), access (including subscriber line charges), alternative access and special access, packet-switched, WATS, 800, 900, message telephone service (MTS), private line, telex, telegraph, video, satellite, intraLATA, international and resale services.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Contribution computations.</E> Contributors' contributions to the TRS fund shall be the product of their subject revenues for the prior calendar year and a contribution factor determined annually by the Commission. The contribution factor shall be based on the ratio between expected TRS Fund expenses to the contributors' revenues subject to contribution. In the event that contributions exceed TRS payments and administrative costs, the <PRTPAGE P="366"/>contribution factor for the following year will be adjusted by an appropriate amount, taking into consideration projected cost and usage changes. In the event that contributions are inadequate, the fund administrator may request authority from the Commission to borrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by future years' contributions. Each subject contributor that has revenues subject to contribution must contribute at least $25 per year. Contributors whose annual contributions total less than $1,200 must pay the entire contribution at the beginning of the contribution period. Contributors whose contributions total $1,200 or more may divide their contributions into equal monthly payments. Contributors shall complete and submit, and contributions shall be based on, a “Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet” (as published by the Commission in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>). The worksheet shall be certified to by an officer of the contributor, and subject to verification by the Commission or the administrator at the discretion of the Commission. Contributors' statements in the worksheet shall be subject to the provisions of section 220 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The fund administrator may bill contributors a separate assessment for reasonable administrative expenses and interest resulting from improper filing or overdue contributions. The Chief of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau may waive, reduce, modify or eliminate contributor reporting requirements that prove unnecessary and require additional reporting requirements that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound and efficient administration of the TRS Fund.</P>

TRS providers must submit to audits annually or at times determined appropriate by the Commission, the fund administrator, or by an entity approved by the Commission for such purpose. A TRS provider that fails to submit to a requested audit, or fails to provide documentation necessary for verification upon reasonable request, will be subject to an automatic suspension of payment until it submits to the requested audit or provides sufficient documentation. In the course of an audit or otherwise upon demand, an IP CTS provider must make available any relevant documentation, including contracts with entities providing services or equipment directly related to the provision of IP CTS, to the Commission, the TRS Fund administrator, or any person authorized by the Commission or TRS Fund administrator to conduct an audit.</P>

The administrator shall file schedules of payment formulas with the Commission. Such formulas shall be designed to compensate TRS providers for reasonable costs of providing interstate TRS, and shall be subject to Commission approval. Such formulas shall be based on total monthly interstate TRS minutes of use. The formulas should appropriately compensate interstate providers for the provision of TRS, whether intrastate or interstate.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) TRS minutes of use for purposes of interstate cost recovery under the TRS Fund are defined as the minutes of use for completed interstate TRS calls placed through the TRS center beginning after call set-up and concluding after the last message call unit.</P>

A request shall be established as compensable only after the administrator, in consultation with the Commission, or the Commission determines that the provider has met its burden to demonstrate that the claim <PRTPAGE P="369"/>is compensable under applicable Commission rules and the procedures established by the administrator. Any request for compensation for which payment has been suspended or withheld in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(L) of this section shall not be established as compensable until the administrator, in consultation with the Commission, or the Commission determines that the request is compensable in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(L)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section.</P>

              <P>(H) Administrator reporting, monitoring, and filing requirements. The administrator shall perform all filing and reporting functions required in paragraphs (c)(5)(iii)(A) through (c)(5)(iii)(J) of this section. TRS payment formulas and revenue requirements shall be filed with the Commission on May 1 of each year, to be effective the following July 1. The administrator shall report annually to the Commission an itemization of monthly administrative costs which shall consist of all expenses, receipts, and payments associated with the administration of the TRS Fund. The administrator is required to keep the TRS Fund separate from all other funds administered by the administrator, shall file a cost allocation manual (CAM) and shall provide the Commission full access to all data collected pursuant to the administration of the TRS Fund. The administrator shall account for the financial transactions of the TRS Fund in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for federal agencies and maintain the accounts of the TRS Fund in accordance with the United States Government Standard General Ledger. When the administrator, or any independent auditor hired by the administrator, conducts audits of providers of services under the TRS program or contributors to the TRS Fund, such audits shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. In administering the TRS Fund, the administrator shall also comply with all relevant and applicable federal financial management and reporting statutes. The administrator shall establish a non-paid voluntary advisory committee of persons from the hearing and speech disability community, TRS users (voice and text telephone), interstate service providers, state representatives, and TRS providers, which will meet at reasonable intervals (at least semi-annually) in order to monitor TRS cost recovery matters. Each group shall select its own representative to the committee. The administrator's annual report shall include a discussion of the advisory committee deliberations.</P>
              <P>(I) <E T="03">Information filed with the administrator.</E> The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or other senior executive of a provider submitting minutes to the Fund for compensation must, in each instance, certify, under penalty of perjury, that the minutes were handled in compliance with section 225 and the Commission's rules and orders, and are not the result of impermissible financial incentives or payments to generate calls. The CEO, CFO, or other senior executive of a provider submitting cost and demand data to the TRS Fund administrator shall certify under penalty of perjury that such information is true and correct. The administrator shall keep all data obtained from contributors and TRS providers confidential <PRTPAGE P="370"/>and shall not disclose such data in company-specific form unless directed to do so by the Commission. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Chief of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, the TRS Fund administrator may share data obtained from carriers with the administrators of the universal support mechanisms (<E T="03">see</E> § 54.701 of this chapter), the North American Numbering Plan administration cost recovery (<E T="03">see</E> § 52.16 of this chapter), and the long-term local number portability cost recovery (<E T="03">see</E> § 52.32 of this chapter). The TRS Fund administrator shall keep confidential all data obtained from other administrators. The administrator shall not use such data except for purposes of administering the TRS Fund, calculating the regulatory fees of interstate common carriers, and aggregating such fee payments for submission to the Commission. The Commission shall have access to all data reported to the administrator, and authority to audit TRS providers. Contributors may make requests for Commission nondisclosure of company-specific revenue information under § 0.459 of this chapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data are submitted. The Commission shall make all decisions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific information.</P>

              <P>(K) All parties providing services or contributions or receiving payments under this section are subject to the enforcement provisions specified in the Communications Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Commission's rules.</P>
              <P>(L) <E T="03">Procedures for the suspension/withholding of payment. </E>(<E T="03">1</E>) The Fund administrator will continue the current practice of reviewing monthly requests for compensation of TRS minutes of use within two months after they are filed with the Fund administrator.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the Fund administrator in consultation with the Commission, or the Commission on its own accord, determines that payments for certain minutes should be withheld, a TRS provider will be notified within two months from the date for the request for compensation was filed, as to why its claim for compensation has been withheld in whole or in part. TRS providers then will be given two additional months from the date of notification to provide additional justification for payment of such minutes of use. Such justification should be sufficiently detailed to provide the Fund administrator and the Commission the information needed to evaluate whether the minutes of use in dispute are compensable. If a TRS provider does not respond, or does not respond with sufficiently detailed information within two months after notification that payment for minutes of use is being withheld, payment for the minutes of use in dispute will be denied permanently.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If, the TRS provider submits additional justification for payment of the minutes of use in dispute within two months after being notified that its initial justification was insufficient, the Fund administrator or the Commission will review such additional justification documentation, and may ask further questions or conduct further investigation to evaluate whether to pay the TRS provider for the minutes of use in dispute, within eight months after submission of such additional justification.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If the provider meets its burden to establish that the minutes in question are compensable under the Commission's rules, the Fund administrator will compensate the provider for such minutes of use. Any payment by the Commission will not preclude any future action by either the Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice to recover past payments (regardless of whether the payment was the subject of withholding) if it is determined at any time that such payment was for minutes billed to the Commission in violation of the Commission's rules or any other civil or criminal law.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) If the Commission determines that the provider has not met its burden to demonstrate that the minutes of use in dispute are compensable under the Commission's rules, payment will be permanently denied. The Fund administrator or the Commission will notify the provider of this decision within one year of the initial request for payment.<PRTPAGE P="371"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) If the VRS provider submits a waiver request asserting exigent circumstances affecting one or more call centers that will make it highly improbable that the VRS provider will meet the speed-of-answer standard for call attempts occurring in a period of time identified by beginning and ending dates, the Fund administrator shall not withhold TRS Fund payments for a VRS provider's failure to meet the speed-of-answer standard during the identified period of time while the waiver request is under review by the Commission. In the event that the waiver request is denied, the speed-of-answer requirement is not met, and payment has been made to the provider from the TRS Fund for the identified period of time or a portion thereof, the provider shall return such payment to the TRS Fund for any period of time when the speed-of-answer requirement was not met.</P>
              <P>(M) <E T="03">Whistleblower protections.</E> Providers shall not take any reprisal in the form of a personnel action against any current or former employee or contractor who discloses to a designated manager of the provider, the Commission, the TRS Fund administrator or to any Federal or state law enforcement entity, any information that the reporting person reasonably believes evidences known or suspected violations of the Communications Act or TRS regulations, or any other activity that the reporting person reasonably believes constitutes waste, fraud, or abuse, or that otherwise could result in the improper billing of minutes of use to the TRS Fund and discloses that information to a designated manager of the provider, the Commission, the TRS Fund administrator or to any Federal or state law enforcement entity. Providers shall provide an accurate and complete description of these TRS whistleblower protections, including the right to notify the FCC's Office of Inspector General or its Enforcement Bureau, to all employees and contractors, in writing. Providers that already disseminate their internal business policies to its employees in writing (<E T="03">e.g.</E> in employee handbooks, policies and procedures manuals, or bulletin board postings—either online or in hard copy) must include an accurate and complete description of these TRS whistleblower protections in those written materials.</P>
              <P>(N) In addition to the provisions set forth above, VRS providers shall be subject to the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Eligibility for reimbursement from the TRS Fund.</E> (<E T="03">i</E>) Only an eligible VRS provider, as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(F) of this section, may hold itself out to the general public as providing VRS.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) VRS service must be offered under the name by which the eligible VRS provider offering such service became certified and in a manner that clearly identifies that provider of the service. Where a TRS provider also utilizes sub-brands to identify its VRS, each sub-brand must clearly identify the eligible VRS provider. Providers must route all VRS calls through a single URL address used for each name or sub-brand used.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) An eligible VRS provider may not contract with or otherwise authorize any third party to provide interpretation services or call center functions (including call distribution, call routing, call setup, mapping, call features, billing, and registration) on its behalf, unless that authorized third party also is an eligible provider.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) To the extent that an eligible VRS provider contracts with or otherwise authorizes a third party to provide any other services or functions related to the provision of VRS other than interpretation services or call center functions, that third party must not hold itself out as a provider of VRS, and must clearly identify the eligible VRS provider to the public. To the extent an eligible VRS provider contracts with or authorizes a third party to provide any services or functions related to marketing or outreach, and such services utilize VRS, those VRS minutes are not compensable on a per minute basis from the TRS fund.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) All third-party contracts or agreements entered into by an eligible provider must be in writing. Copies of such agreements shall be made available to the Commission and to the TRS Fund administrator upon request.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Call center reports.</E> VRS providers shall file a written report with the <PRTPAGE P="372"/>Commission and the TRS Fund administrator, on April 1st and October 1st of each year for each call center that handles VRS calls that the provider owns or controls, including centers located outside of the United States, that includes:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The complete street address of the center;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The number of individual CAs and CA managers; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The name and contact information (phone number and e-mail address) of the manager(s) at the center. VRS providers shall also file written notification with the Commission and the TRS Fund administrator of any change in a center's location, including the opening, closing, or relocation of any center, at least 30 days prior to any such change.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Compensation of CAs.</E> VRS providers may not compensate, give a preferential work schedule or otherwise benefit a CA in any manner that is based upon the number of VRS minutes or calls that the CA relays, either individually or as part of a group.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Remote training session calls.</E> VRS calls to a remote training session or a comparable activity will not be compensable from the TRS Fund when the provider submitting minutes for such a call has been involved, in any manner, with such a training session. Such prohibited involvement includes training programs or comparable activities in which the provider or any affiliate or related party thereto, including but not limited to its subcontractors, partners, employees or sponsoring organizations or entities, has any role in arranging, scheduling, sponsoring, hosting, conducting or promoting such programs or activities.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Complaints</E>—(i) <E T="03">Referral of complaint.</E> If a complaint to the Commission alleges a violation of this subpart with respect to intrastate TRS within a state and certification of the program of such state under § 64.606 is in effect, the Commission shall refer such complaint to such state expeditiously.</P>
              <P>(ii) Intrastate complaints shall be resolved by the state within 180 days after the complaint is first filed with a state entity, regardless of whether it is filed with the state relay administrator, a state PUC, the relay provider, or with any other state entity.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Jurisdiction of Commission.</E> After referring a complaint to a state entity under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, or if a complaint is filed directly with a state entity, the Commission shall exercise jurisdiction over such complaint only if:</P>
              <P>(A) Final action under such state program has not been taken within:</P>

For software applications on mobile phones, laptops, tablets, computers or other similar devices, IP CTS providers shall ensure that, each time the consumer logs into the application, the notification language required by this paragraph appears in a conspicuous location on the device screen immediately after log-in.</P>
              <P>(iv) IP CTS providers shall maintain, with each consumer's registration records, records describing any IP CTS equipment provided, directly or indirectly, to such consumer, stating the amount paid for such equipment, and stating whether the label required by paragraph (c)(11)(iii) of this section was affixed to such equipment prior to its provision to the consumer.

              <P>(v) IP CTS providers shall ensure that their informational materials and websites used to market, advertise, educate, or otherwise inform consumers and professionals about IP CTS include the following language in a prominent location in a clearly legible font: “FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS ANYONE BUT REGISTERED USERS WITH HEARING LOSS FROM USING INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) CAPTIONED TELEPHONES WITH THE CAPTIONS TURNED ON. IP Captioned Telephone Service may use a live operator. The operator generates captions of what the other party to the call says. These captions are then sent to your phone. There is a cost for each minute of captions generated, paid from a federally administered fund.” For IP CTS provider websites, the language shall be included on the website's home page, each page that provides consumer information about IP CTS, and each page that provides information on how to order IP CTS or IP CTS equipment. IP CTS providers that do not make any use of live CAs to generate captions may shorten the notice to leave out the second, third, and fourth sentences.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emergency calling requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Additional emergency calling requirements applicable to internet-based TRS providers.</E> (1) As of December 31, 2008, the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iv) of this section shall not apply to providers of VRS and IP Relay to which § 64.605(b) applies.</P>
              <P>(2) Each provider of Internet-based TRS shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Accept and handle emergency calls and access, either directly or via a third party, a commercially available database that will allow the provider to determine an appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that corresponds to the caller's location, and to relay the call to that entity;</P>

              <P>(ii) Implement a system that ensures that the provider answers an incoming emergency call before other non-emergency calls (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, prioritize emergency calls and move them to the top of the queue);</P>
              <P>(iii) Request, at the beginning of each emergency call, the caller's name and location information, unless the Internet-based TRS provider already has, or has access to, a Registered Location for the caller;</P>
              <P>(iv) Deliver to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority, at the outset of the outbound leg of an emergency call, at a minimum, the name of the relay user and location of the emergency, as well as the name of the relay provider, the CA's callback number, and the CA's identification number, thereby enabling the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority to re-establish contact with the CA in the event the call is disconnected;</P>

              <P>(v) In the event one or both legs of an emergency call are disconnected (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, either the call between the TRS user and the CA, or the outbound voice telephone call between the CA and the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority), immediately re-establish contact with the TRS user and/or the appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority and resume handling the call; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Ensure that information obtained as a result of this section is limited to that needed to facilitate 911 services, is made available only to emergency call handlers and emergency response or law enforcement personnel, and is used for the sole purpose of ascertaining a user's location in an emergency situation or for other emergency or law enforcement purposes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">E911 Service for VRS and IP Relay</E>—(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The following requirements are only applicable to providers of VRS <PRTPAGE P="377"/>or IP Relay. Further, the following requirements apply only to 911 calls placed by registered users whose Registered Location is in a geographic area served by a Wireline E911 Network and is available to the provider handling the call.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">E911 Service.</E> As of December 31, 2008:</P>
              <P>(i) VRS or IP Relay providers must, as a condition of providing service to a user, provide that user with E911 service as described in this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) VRS or IP Relay providers must transmit all 911 calls, as well as ANI, the caller's Registered Location, the name of the VRS or IP Relay provider, and the CA's identification number for each call, to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to § 64.3001 of this chapter, provided that “all 911 calls” is defined as “any communication initiated by an VRS or IP Relay user dialing 911”;</P>
              <P>(iii) All 911 calls must be routed through the use of ANI and, if necessary, pseudo-ANI, via the dedicated Wireline E911 Network; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The Registered Location, the name of the VRS or IP Relay provider, and the CA's identification number must be available to the appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority from or through the appropriate automatic location information (ALI) database.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Service level obligation.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority is not capable of receiving and processing either ANI or location information, a VRS or IP Relay provider need not provide such ANI or location information; however, nothing in this paragraph affects the obligation under paragraph (c) of this section of a VRS or IP Relay provider to transmit via the Wireline E911 Network all 911 calls to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to § 64.3001 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Registered location requirement.</E> As of December 31, 2008, VRS and IP Relay providers must:</P>
              <P>(i) Obtain from each Registered Internet-based TRS User, prior to the initiation of service, the physical location at which the service will first be utilized; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the VRS or IP Relay is capable of being used from more than one location, provide their registered Internet-based TRS users one or more methods of updating their Registered Location, including at least one option that requires use only of the iTRS access technology necessary to access the VRS or IP Relay. Any method utilized must allow a registered Internet-based TRS user to update the Registered Location at will and in a timely manner.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Internet-based TRS registration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Default provider registration.</E> Every provider of VRS or IP Relay must, no later than December 31, 2008, provide users with the capability to register with that VRS or IP Relay provider as a “default provider.” Upon a user's registration, the VRS or IP Relay provider shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Either:</P>
              <P>(i) Facilitate the user's valid number portability request as set forth in 47 CFR 52.34; or, if the user does not wish to port a number,</P>
              <P>(ii) Assign that user a geographically appropriate North American Numbering Plan telephone number; and</P>
              <P>(2) Route and deliver all of that user's inbound and outbound calls unless the user chooses to place a call with, or receives a call from, an alternate provider.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Certification of eligibility of VRS users.</E> (i) A VRS provider seeking compensation from the TRS Fund for providing VRS to a particular user registered with that provider must first <PRTPAGE P="388"/>obtain a written certification from the user, attesting that the user is eligible to use VRS.</P>
              <P>(ii) The certification required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must include the user's attestation that:</P>
              <P>(A) The user has a hearing or speech disability; and</P>
              <P>(B) The user understands that the cost of VRS calls is paid for by contributions from other telecommunications users to the TRS Fund.</P>
              <P>(iii) The certification required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must be made on a form separate from any other agreement or form, and must include a separate user signature specific to the certification. For the purposes of this rule, an electronic signature, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, as an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record, has the same legal effect as a written signature. For the purposes of this rule, an electronic record, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act as a contract or other record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means, constitutes a record.</P>
              <P>(iv) Each VRS provider shall maintain the confidentiality of any registration and certification information obtained by the provider, and may not disclose such registration and certification information or the content of such registration and certification information except as required by law or regulation.</P>
              <P>(v) VRS providers must, for existing registered Internet-based TRS users, submit the certification required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section to the TRS User Registration Database within 60 days of notice from the Managing Director that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information.</P>
              <P>(vi) When registering a user that is transferring service from another VRS provider, VRS providers shall obtain and submit a properly executed certification if a query of the TRS User Registration Database shows a properly executed certification has not been filed.</P>
              <P>(vii) VRS providers shall require their CAs to terminate any call which does not involve an individual eligible to use VRS due to a hearing or speech disability or, pursuant to the provider's policies, the call does not appear to be a legitimate VRS call, and VRS providers may not seek compensation for such calls from the TRS Fund.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">TRS User Registration Database Information Requirements for VRS.</E> Each VRS provider shall collect and transmit to the TRS User Registration Database, in a format prescribed by the administrator of the TRS User Registration Database, the following information for each of its new and existing registered internet-based TRS users: Full name; address; ten-digit telephone number assigned in the TRS numbering directory; last four digits of the social security number or Tribal Identification number, if the registered internet-based TRS user is a member of a Tribal nation and does not have a social security number; date of birth; Registered Location; VRS provider name and dates of service initiation and termination; a digital copy of the user's self-certification of eligibility for VRS and the date obtained by the provider; the date on which the user's identification was verified; and (for existing users only) the date on which the registered internet-based TRS user last placed a point-to-point or relay call.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Assignment of iTRS Numbers to Hearing Point-to-Point Video Users.</E> (i) Before assigning an iTRS telephone number to a hearing individual, a VRS provider shall obtain from such individual, the individual's full name, residential address, date of birth, and a written certification, attesting that the individual:</P>
              <P>(A) Is proficient in sign language;</P>
              <P>(B) Understands that the iTRS number may be used only for the purpose of point-to-point communication over distances with registered VRS users; and</P>
              <P>(C) Understands that such iTRS number may not be used to access VRS.</P>

              <P>(ii) Before assigning an iTRS telephone number to a hearing individual, a VRS provider also shall obtain the individual's consent to provide the information required by this paragraph (a)(5) to the TRS User Registration <PRTPAGE P="389"/>Database. Before obtaining such consent, the VRS provider, using clear, easily understood language, shall describe the specific information to be provided, explain that the information is provided to ensure proper administration of the TRS program and inform the individual that failure to provide consent will result in denial of service. VRS providers shall obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgment of such consent by every hearing point-to-point video user to whom an iTRS number is assigned.</P>
              <P>(iii) The certification required by paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section must be made on a form separate from any other agreement or form, and must include a separate signature specific to the certification. For the purposes of this rule, an electronic signature, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, as an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record, has the same legal effect as a written signature. For the purposes of this rule, an electronic record, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act as a contract or other record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means, constitutes a record.</P>
              <P>(iv) Before commencing service to any hearing point-to-point video user to whom a VRS provider assigns an iTRS number on or after the TRS User Registration Database is operational, a VRS provider shall submit to the TRS User Registration Database the information listed in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section and the following additional information:</P>
              <P>(A) The ten-digit telephone number assigned in the TRS Numbering Directory to the hearing point-to-point user;</P>
              <P>(B) The VRS provider's name and the date of service initiation; and</P>
              <P>(C) The date on which a ten-digit number was assigned to or removed from a hearing point-to-point user.</P>
              <P>(v) For all other hearing point-to-point video users to whom a VRS provider has assigned an iTRS number, the VRS provider shall transmit the information required by paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section within 60 days after the TRS User Registration Database is operational.</P>
              <P>(vi) Upon the termination of service to any hearing point-to-point video user, a VRS provider shall submit to the TRS User Registration Database the date of termination of service.</P>
              <P>(vii) A VRS provider shall maintain the confidentiality of the information about hearing individuals required by this paragraph (a)(5) and may not disclose such information except as required by law or regulation.</P>
              <P>(viii) Before commencing service to a hearing point-to-point video user who is transferring point-to-point video service from another VRS provider, a VRS provider shall notify the TRS User Registration Database of such transfer and shall obtain and submit a properly executed certification under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ix) Hearing individuals who are assigned iTRS numbers under this paragraph (a)(5) shall not be deemed registered VRS users. VRS providers shall not be compensated and shall not seek compensation from the TRS Fund for any VRS calls to or from such iTRS numbers.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Enterprise and public videophones</E>—(i) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of this section, a default VRS provider for an enterprise or public videophone is the VRS provider that assigns a North American Numbering Plan (NANP) telephone number to such videophone or receives a port of such number.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Enterprise and public videophone certification.</E> (A) <E T="03">Written certification.</E> A default VRS provider for an enterprise or public videophone shall obtain a written certification from the individual responsible for the videophone, attesting that the individual understands the functions of the videophone and that the cost of VRS calls made on the videophone is financed by the federally regulated Interstate TRS Fund, and for enterprise videophones, that the organization, business, or agency will make reasonable efforts to ensure that only persons with a hearing or speech disability are permitted to use the phone for VRS.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Electronic signatures.</E> The certification required by paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(A) of this section must be <PRTPAGE P="390"/>made on a form separate from any other agreement or form, and must include a separate signature specific to the certification. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(B), an electronic signature, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act as an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record, has the same legal effect as a written signature. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(B), an electronic record, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act as a contract or other record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means, constitutes a record.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Consent for transmission and confidentiality of enterprise and public videophone registration.</E> A default VRS provider for an enterprise or public videophone must obtain consent from the individual responsible for the videophone to transmit the information required by this section to the TRS User Registration Database. Before obtaining such consent, a VRS provider must describe to such individual, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the TRS User Registration Database to ensure proper administration of the TRS program, and that failure to provide consent will result in denial of service to the videophone. A VRS provider must obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgment of such consent for every enterprise and public videophone. A VRS provider shall maintain the confidentiality of any registration and certification information obtained by the provider, and may not disclose such registration and certification information, or the content of such registration and certification information, except as required by law or regulation.</P>

              <P>(ii) Communicate among themselves as necessary to ensure that:</P>
              <P>(A) Only the default provider provisions routing information to the central database; and</P>
              <P>(B) VRS and IP Relay providers other than the default provider are aware that they must query the TRS Numbering Directory in order to obtain accurate routing information for a particular user of VRS or IP Relay, or for an enterprise or public videophone.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Proxy numbers.</E> After December 31, 2008, a VRS or IP Relay provider:</P>
              <P>(1) May not assign or issue a proxy or alias for a NANP telephone number to any user; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Verification of orders for change of default TRS providers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) No iTRS provider, either directly or through its numbering partner, shall initiate or implement the process to change an iTRS user's selection of a default provider prior to obtaining:</P>
              <P>(1) Authorization from the iTRS user, and</P>
              <P>(2) Verification of that authorization in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this section. The new default provider shall maintain and preserve without alteration or modification all records of verification of the iTRS user's authorization for a minimum period of five years after obtaining such verification and shall make such records available to the Commission upon request. In any case where the iTRS provider is unable, unwilling or otherwise fails to make such records available to the Commission upon request, it shall be presumed that the iTRS provider has failed to comply with its verification obligations under the rules.</P>
              <P>(b) Where an iTRS provider is offering more than one type of TRS, that provider must obtain separate authorization from the iTRS user for each service, although the authorizations may be obtained within the same transaction. Each authorization must be verified separately from any other authorizations obtained in the same transaction. Each authorization must be verified in accordance with the verification procedures prescribed in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) A new iTRS provider shall not, either directly or through its numbering partner, initiate or implement the process to change a default provider unless and until the order has been verified in accordance with one of the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) The iTRS provider has obtained the iTRS user's written or electronically signed authorization in a form that meets the requirements of § 64.632 of this part; or</P>

              <P>(2) An independent third party meeting the qualifications in this subsection has obtained, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, the iTRS user's authorization to implement the default provider change <PRTPAGE P="401"/>order that confirms and includes appropriate verification of registration data with the TRS User Registration Database as defined in § 64.601(a) of this part. The independent third party must not be owned, managed, controlled, or directed by the iTRS provider or the iTRS provider's marketing agent; must not have any financial incentive to confirm default provider change orders for the iTRS provider or the iTRS provider's marketing agent; and must operate in a location physically separate from the iTRS provider or the iTRS provider's marketing agent.</P>
              <P>(i) Methods of third party verification. Third party verification systems and three-way conference calls may be used for verification purposes so long as the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) through (iv) of this section are satisfied. It shall be a per se violation of these rules if at any time the iTRS provider, an iTRS provider's marketing representative, or any other person misleads the iTRS user with respect to the authorization that the iTRS user is giving, the purpose of that authorization, the purpose of the verification, the verification process, or the identity of the person who is placing the call as well as on whose behalf the call is being placed, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(ii) Provider initiation of third party verification. An iTRS provider or an iTRS provider's marketing representative initiating a three-way conference call must drop off the call once the three-way connection has been established.</P>
              <P>(iii) Requirements for content and format of third party verification. Any description of the default provider change transaction by a third party verifier must not be misleading. At the start of the third party verification process, the third party verifier shall identify the new default provider to the iTRS user and shall confirm that the iTRS user understands that the iTRS user is changing default providers and will no longer receive service from the iTRS user's current iTRS provider. In addition, all third party verification methods shall elicit, at a minimum: The date of the verification; the identity of the iTRS user; confirmation that the person on the call is the iTRS user; confirmation that the iTRS user wants to make the default provider change; confirmation that the iTRS user understands that a default provider change, not an upgrade to existing service, or any other misleading description of the transaction, is being authorized; confirmation that the iTRS user understands what the change in default provider means, including that the iTRS user may need to return any video equipment belonging to the original default provider; the name of the new default provider affected by the change; the telephone number of record to be transferred to the new default provider; and the type of TRS used with the telephone number being transferred. If the iTRS user has additional questions for the iTRS provider's marketing representative during the verification process, the verifier shall instruct the iTRS user that they are terminating the verification process, that the iTRS user may contact the marketing representative with additional questions, and that the iTRS user's default provider will not be changed. The marketing representative may again initiate the verification process following the procedures set out in this section after the iTRS user contacts the marketing representative with any additional questions. Third party verifiers may not market the iTRS provider's services by providing additional information.</P>

              <P>(iv) Other requirements for third party verification. All third party verifications shall be conducted in the same language and format that were used in the underlying marketing transaction and shall be recorded in their entirety. In the case of VRS, this means that if the marketing process was conducted in American Sign Language (ASL), then the third party verification shall be conducted in ASL. In the event that the underlying marketing transaction was conducted via text over IP Relay, such text format shall be used for the third party verification. The third party verifier shall inform both the iTRS user and, where applicable, the communications assistant relaying the call, that the call is being recorded. The third party verifier shall provide the new default provider an audio, video, or IP Relay <PRTPAGE P="402"/>transcript of the verification of the iTRS user authorization. New default providers shall maintain and preserve audio and video records of verification of iTRS user authorization in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) A new default provider shall implement an iTRS user's default provider change order within 60 days of obtaining either:</P>
              <P>(1) A written or electronically signed letter of agency in accordance with § 64.632 of this part or</P>
              <P>(2) Third party verification of the iTRS user's default provider change order in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If not implemented within 60 days as required herein, such default provider change order shall be deemed void.</P>
              <P>(e) At any time during the process of changing an iTRS user's default provider, and until such process is completed, which is when the new default provider assumes the role of default provider, the original default provider shall not:</P>
              <P>(1) Reduce the level or quality of iTRS service provided to such iTRS user, or</P>
              <P>(2) Reduce the functionality of any VRS access technology provided by the iTRS provider to such iTRS user.</P>
              <P>(f) An iTRS provider that is certified pursuant to § 64.606(a)(2) of this part may acquire, through a sale or transfer, either part or all of another iTRS provider's iTRS user base without obtaining each iTRS user's authorization and verification in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the acquiring iTRS provider complies with the following streamlined procedures. An iTRS provider shall not use these streamlined procedures for any fraudulent purpose, including any attempt to avoid liability for violations under part 64 of the Commission rules.</P>
              <P>(1) Not later than 30 days before the transfer of the affected iTRS users from the selling or transferring iTRS provider to the acquiring iTRS provider, the acquiring iTRS provider shall provide notice to each affected iTRS user of the information specified herein. The acquiring iTRS provider is required to fulfill the obligations set forth in the advance iTRS user notice. In the case of VRS, the notice shall be provided as a pre-recorded video message in American Sign Language sent to all affected iTRS users. In the case of IP Relay, the notice shall be provided as a pre-recorded text message sent to all affected iTRS users. The advance iTRS user notice shall be provided in a manner consistent with 47 U.S.C. 255, 617, 619 and the Commission's rules regarding accessibility to blind and visually-impaired consumers, §§ 6.3, 6.5, 14.20, and 14.21 of this chapter. The following information must be included in the advance iTRS user notice:</P>
              <P>(i) The date on which the acquiring iTRS provider will become the iTRS user's new default provider;</P>
              <P>(ii) The iTRS user's right to select a different default provider for the iTRS at issue, if an alternative iTRS provider is available;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether the acquiring iTRS provider will be responsible for handling any complaints filed, or otherwise raised, prior to or during the transfer against the selling or transferring iTRS provider, and</P>
              <P>(iv) The toll-free customer service telephone number of the acquiring iTRS provider.</P>
              <P>(2) All iTRS users receiving the notice will be transferred to the acquiring iTRS provider, unless they have selected a different default provider before the transfer date.</P>

              <P>(4) That the iTRS user understands that only one iTRS provider may be designated as the TRS user's default provider for any one telephone number.</P>
              <P>(e) If any portion of a letter of authorization is translated into another language then all portions of the letter of authorization must be translated into that language. Every letter of authorization must be translated into the same language as any promotional materials, descriptions or instructions provided with the letter of authorization.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Furnishing of enhanced services and customer-premises equipment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For the purpose of this subpart, the term <E T="03">enhanced service</E> shall refer to services, offered over common carrier transmission facilities used in interstate communications, which employ computer processing applications that <PRTPAGE P="405"/>act on the format, content, code, protocol or similar aspects of the subscriber's transmitted information; provide the subscriber additional, different, or restructured information; or involve subscriber interaction with stored information. Enhanced services are not regulated under title II of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Bell Operating Companies common carriers subject, in whole or in part, to the Communications Act may directly provide enhanced services and customer-premises equipment; provided, however, that the Commission may prohibit any such common carrier from engaging directly or indirectly in furnishing enhanced services or customer-premises equipment to others except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) A Bell Operating Company common carrier prohibited by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section from engaging in the furnishing of enhanced services or customer-premises equipment may, subject to other provisions of law, have a controlling or lesser interest in, or be under common control with, a separate corporate entity that furnishes enhanced services or customer-premises equipment to others provided the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) Each such separate corporation shall obtain all transmission facilities necessary for the provision of enhanced services pursuant to tariff, and may not own any network or local distribution transmission facilities or equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) Each such separate corporation shall operate independently in the furnishing of enhanced services and customer-premises equipment. It shall maintain its own books of account, have separate officers, utilize separate operating, marketing, installation, and maintenance personnel, and utilize separate computer facilities in the provision of enhanced services.</P>
              <P>(3) Each such separate corporation which provides customer-premises equipment or enhanced services shall deal with any affiliated manufacturing entity only on an arm's length basis.</P>
              <P>(4) Any research or development performed on a joint or separate basis for the subsidiary must be done on a compensatory basis. Except for generic software within equipment, manufactured by an affiliate, that is sold “off the shelf” to any interested purchaser, the separate corporation must develop its own software, or contract with non-affiliated vendors.</P>
              <P>(5) All transactions between the separate corporation and the carrier or its affiliates which involve the transfer, either direct or by accounting or other record entries, of money, personnel, resources, other assets or anything of value, shall be reduced to writing. A copy of any contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into between such entities shall be filed with the Commission within 30 days after the contract, agreement, or other arrangement is made. This provision shall not apply to any transaction governed by the provision of an effective state or federal tariff.</P>
              <P>(d) A carrier subject to the proscription set forth in paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall not engage in the sale or promotion of enhanced services or customer-premises equipment, on behalf of the separate corporation, or sell, lease or otherwise make available to the separate corporation any capacity or computer system component on its computer system or systems which are used in any way for the provision of its common carrier communications services. (This does not apply to communications services offered the separate subsidiary pursuant to tariff);</P>
              <P>(2) Shall disclose to the public all information relating to network design and technical standards and information affecting changes to the telecommunications network which would affect either intercarrier interconnection or the manner in which customer-premises equipment is attached to the interstate network prior to implementation and with reasonable advance notification. Such information shall be disclosed in compliance with the procedures set forth in 47 CFR 51.325 through 51.335.</P>
              <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(4) Must obtain Commission approval as to the manner in which the separate corporation is to be capitalized, prior <PRTPAGE P="406"/>to obtaining any interest in the separate corporation or transferring any assets, and must obtain Commission approval of any modification to a Commission approved capitalization plan.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as otherwise ordered by the Commission, the carrier provision of customer premises equipment used in conjunction with the interstate telecommunications network may be offered in combination with the provision of common carrier communications services, except that the customer premises equipment shall not be offered on a tariffed basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Consumer information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each provider of operator services shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify itself, audibly and distinctly, to the consumer at the beginning of each telephone call and before the consumer incurs any charge for the call;</P>
              <P>(2) Permit the consumer to terminate the telephone call at no charge before the call is connected;</P>
              <P>(3) Disclose immediately to the consumer, upon request and at no charge to the consumer—</P>
              <P>(i) A quotation of its rates or charges for the call;</P>
              <P>(ii) The methods by which such rates or charges will be collected; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The methods by which complaints concerning such rates, charges, or collection practices will be resolved; and</P>
              <P>(4) Disclose, audibly and distinctly to the consumer, at no charge and before connecting any interstate non-access code operator service call, how to obtain the total cost of the call, including any aggregator surcharge, or the maximum possible total cost of the call, including any aggregator surcharge, before providing further oral advice to the consumer on how to proceed to make the call. The oral disclosure required in this subsection shall instruct consumers that they may obtain applicable rate and surcharge quotations either, at the option of the provider of operator services, by dialing no more than two digits or by remaining on the line. The phrase “total cost of the call” as used in this paragraph means both the variable (duration-based) charges for the call and the total per-call charges, exclusive of taxes, that the carrier, or its billing agent, may collect from the consumer for the call. It does not include additional charges that may be assessed and collected without the involvement of the carrier, such as a hotel surcharge billed by a hotel. Such charges are addressed in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Each aggregator shall post on or near the telephone instrument, in plain view of consumers:</P>
              <P>(1) The name, address, and toll-free telephone number of the provider of operator services;</P>
              <P>(2) Except for CMRS aggregators, a written disclosure that the rates for all operator-assisted calls are available on request, and that consumers have a right to obtain access to the interstate common carrier of their choice and may contact their preferred interstate common carriers for information on accessing that carrier's service using that telephone;</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of a pay telephone, the local coin rate for the pay telephone location; and</P>

              <P>(4) The name and address of the Consumer Information Bureau of the Commission (Federal Communications Commission, Consumer Information Bureau, Consumer Complaints—Telephone, Washington, D.C. 20554), to which the consumer may direct complaints regarding operator services. An existing posting that displays the address that was required prior to the amendment of this rules (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the address of the Common Carrier Bureau's Enforcement Division, which no longer exists) may remain until such time as the posting is replaced for any other purpose. Any posting made after the effective date of this amendment must display the updated address (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the address of the Consumer Information Bureau).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Updating of postings.</E> The posting required by this section shall be updated as soon as practicable following any change of the carrier presubscribed to provide interstate service at an aggregator location, but no later than <PRTPAGE P="407"/>30 days following such change. This requirement may be satisfied by applying to a payphone a temporary sticker displaying the required posting information, provided that any such temporary sticker shall be replaced with permanent signage during the next regularly scheduled maintenance visit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of state law or regulation.</E> The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to an aggregator in any case in which State law or State regulation requires the aggregator to take actions that are substantially the same as those required in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Each provider of operator services shall ensure, by contract or tariff, that each aggregator for which such provider is the presubscribed provider of operator services is in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Operator services for prison inmate phones.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each provider of inmate operator services shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify itself and disclose, audibly and distinctly to the consumer, at no charge and before connecting any interstate, non-access code operator service call, how to obtain the total cost of the call, including any surcharge or premises-imposed-fee. The oral disclosure required in this paragraph shall instruct consumers that they may obtain applicable rate and surcharge quotations either, at the option of the provider of inmate operator services, by dialing no more than two digits or by remaining on the line. The phrase “total cost of the call,” as used in this paragraph, means both the variable (duration-based) charges for the call and the total per-call charges, exclusive of taxes, that the carrier, or its billing agent, may collect from the consumer for the call. Such phrase shall include any per-call surcharge imposed by the correctional institution, unless it is subject to regulation itself as a common carrier for imposing such surcharges, if the contract between the carrier and the correctional institution prohibits both resale and the use of pre-paid calling card arrangements.</P>
              <P>(2) Permit the consumer to terminate the telephone call at no charge before the call is connected; and</P>
              <P>(3) Disclose immediately to the consumer, upon request and at no charge to the consumer—</P>
              <P>(i) The methods by which its rates or charges for the call will be collected; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The methods by which complaints concerning such rates, charges or collection practices will be resolved.</P>
              <P>(b) As used in this subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Consumer</E> means the party to be billed for any interstate call from an inmate telephone;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inmate telephone</E> means a telephone instrument set aside by authorities of a prison or other correctional institution for use by inmates.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inmate operator services</E> means any interstate telecommunications service initiated from an inmate telephone that includes, as a component, any automatic or live assistance to a consumer to arrange for billing or completion, or both, of an interstate telephone call through a method other than:</P>
              <P>(i) Automatic completion with billing to the telephone from which the call originated; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Completion through an access code used by the consumer, with billing to an account previously established with the carrier by the consumer;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Provider of inmate operator services</E> means any common carrier that provides outbound interstate operator services from inmate telephones.</P>

              <P>(a) Carriers required to separate their regulated costs from nonregulated costs shall use the attributable cost method of cost allocation for such purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) In assigning or allocating costs to regulated and nonregulated activities, carriers shall follow the principles described herein.</P>
              <P>(1) Tariffed services provided to a nonregulated activity will be charged to the nonregulated activity at the tariffed rates and credited to the regulated revenue account for that service. Nontariffed services, offered pursuant to a section 252(e) agreement, provided to a nonregulated activity will be charged to the nonregulated activity at the amount set forth in the applicable interconnection agreement approved by a state commission pursuant to section 252(e) and credited to the regulated revenue account for that service.</P>
              <P>(2) Costs shall be directly assigned to either regulated or nonregulated activities whenever possible.</P>

              <P>(3) Costs which cannot be directly assigned to either regulated or nonregulated activities will be described as common costs. Common costs shall be grouped into homogeneous cost categories designed to facilitate the proper allocation of costs between a carrier's regulated and nonregulated activities. Each cost category shall be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities in accordance with the following hierarchy:<PRTPAGE P="412"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Whenever possible, common cost categories are to be allocated based upon direct analysis of the origin of the cost themselves.</P>
              <P>(ii) When direct analysis is not possible, common cost categories shall be allocated based upon an indirect, cost-causative linkage to another cost category (or group of cost categories) for which a direct assignment or allocation is available.</P>
              <P>(iii) When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, the cost category shall be allocated based upon a general allocator computed by using the ratio of all expenses directly assigned or attributed to regulated and nonregulated activities.</P>
              <P>(4) The allocation of central office equipment and outside plant investment costs between regulated and nonregulated activities shall be based upon the relative regulated and nonregulated usage of the investment during the calendar year when nonregulated usage is greatest in comparison to regulated usage during the three calendar years beginning with the calendar year during which the investment usage forecast is filed.</P>
              <P>(c) A telecommunications carrier may not use services that are not competitive to subsidize services subject to competition. Services included in the definition of universal service shall bear no more than a reasonable share of the joint and common costs of facilities used to provide those services.</P>

The manual shall contain the following information regarding the carrier's allocation of costs between regulated and nonregulated activities:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of each of the carrier's nonregulated activities;</P>
              <P>(2) A list of all the activities to which the carrier now accords incidental accounting treatment and the justification therefor;</P>
              <P>(3) A chart showing all of the carrier's corporate affiliates;</P>
              <P>(4) A statement identifying each affiliate that engages in or will engage in transactions with the carrier and describing the nature, terms and frequency of each transaction;</P>
              <P>(5) A cost apportionment table showing, for each account containing costs incurred in providing regulated services, the cost pools with that account, the procedures used to place costs into each cost pool, and the method used to apportion the costs within each cost pool between regulated and nonregulated activities; and</P>
              <P>(6) A description of the time reporting procedures that the carrier uses, including the methods or studies designed to measure and allocate non-productive time.</P>

              <P>(b) Each carrier shall ensure that the information contained in its cost allocation manual is accurate. Carriers must update their cost allocation manuals at least annually, except that changes to the cost apportionment table and to the description of time reporting procedures must be filed at the time of implementation. Annual cost allocation manual updates shall be filed on or before the last working day of each calendar year. Proposed changes in the description of time reporting procedures, the statement concerning affiliate transactions, and the cost apportionment table must be accompanied by a statement quantifying the impact of each change on regulated operations. Changes in the description of time reporting procedures and the statement concerning affiliate transactions must be quantified in $100,000 <PRTPAGE P="413"/>increments at the account level. Changes in cost apportionment tables must be quantified in $100,000 increments at the cost pool level. The Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau may suspend any such changes for a period not to exceed 180 days, and may thereafter allow the change to become effective or prescribe a different procedure.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Verification of orders for telecommunications service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) No telecommunications carrier shall submit or execute a change on the behalf of a subscriber in the subscriber's selection of a provider of telecommunications service except in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this subpart. Nothing in this section shall preclude any State commission from enforcing these procedures with respect to intrastate services.</P>
              <P>(1) No submitting carrier shall submit a change on the behalf of a subscriber in the subscriber's selection of a provider of telecommunications service prior to obtaining:</P>
              <P>(i) Authorization from the subscriber, subject to the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Material misrepresentation on the sales call is prohibited. Upon a consumer's credible allegation of a sales call misrepresentation, the burden of proof shifts to the carrier making the sales call to provide persuasive evidence to rebut the claim. Upon a finding that such a material misrepresentation has occurred on a sales call, the subscriber's authorization to switch carriers will be deemed invalid.</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(ii) Verification of that authorization in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this section. The submitting carrier shall maintain and preserve records of verification of subscriber authorization for a minimum period of two years after obtaining such verification.</P>

              <P>(2) An executing carrier shall not verify the submission of a change in a subscriber's selection of a provider of telecommunications service received <PRTPAGE P="416"/>from a submitting carrier. For an executing carrier, compliance with the procedures described in this part shall be defined as prompt execution, without any unreasonable delay, of changes that have been verified by a submitting carrier.</P>
              <P>(3) Commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) providers shall be excluded from the verification requirements of this part as long as they are not required to provide equal access to common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services, in accordance with 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(8).</P>
              <P>(b) Any telecommunications carrier that becomes the subject of a Commission forfeiture action through a violation of the third-party verification process set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be suspended for a five-year period from utilizing the third-party verification process to confirm a carrier change.</P>
              <P>(c) No telecommunications carrier shall submit a preferred carrier change order unless and until the order has been confirmed in accordance with one of the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) The telecommunications carrier has obtained the subscriber's written or electronically signed authorization in a form that meets the requirements of § 64.1130; or</P>
              <P>(2) The telecommunications carrier has obtained the subscriber's electronic authorization to submit the preferred carrier change order. Such authorization must be placed from the telephone number(s) on which the preferred carrier is to be changed and must confirm the information in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Telecommunications carriers electing to confirm sales electronically shall establish one or more toll-free telephone numbers exclusively for that purpose. Calls to the number(s) will connect a subscriber to a voice response unit, or similar mechanism, that records the required information regarding the preferred carrier change, including automatically recording the originating automatic number identification; or</P>
              <P>(3) An appropriately qualified independent third party has obtained, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iv) of this section, the subscriber's oral authorization to submit the preferred carrier change order that confirms and includes appropriate verification data (e.g., the subscriber's date of birth or social security number). The independent third party must not be owned, managed, controlled, or directed by the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent; must not have any financial incentive to confirm preferred carrier change orders for the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent; and must operate in a location physically separate from the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Methods of third party verification.</E> Automated third party verification systems and three-way conference calls may be used for verification purposes so long as the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) through (c)(3)(iv) of this section are satisfied.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Carrier initiation of third party verification.</E> A carrier or a carrier's sales representative initiating a three-way conference call or a call through an automated verification system must drop off the call once the three-way connection has been established.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requirements for content and format of third party verification.</E> Any description of the carrier change transaction by a third party verifier must not be misleading, and all third party verification methods shall elicit, at a minimum: The date of the verification; the identity of the subscriber; confirmation that the person on the call is authorized to make the carrier change; confirmation that the person on the call wants to make the carrier change; confirmation that the person on the call understands that a carrier change, not an upgrade to existing service, bill consolidation, or any other misleading description of the transaction, is being authorized; the names of the carriers affected by the change (not including the name of the displaced carrier); the telephone numbers to be switched; and the types of service involved (including a brief description of a service about which the subscriber demonstrates confusion regarding the nature of that service). Except in Hawaii, any description of interLATA or long distance service shall convey that it encompasses both international and state-to-state calls, as well as some intrastate <PRTPAGE P="417"/>calls where applicable. If the subscriber has additional questions for the carrier's sales representative during the verification, the verifier shall indicate to the subscriber that, upon completion of the verification process, the subscriber will have authorized a carrier change. Third party verifiers may not market the carrier's services by providing additional information, including information regarding preferred carrier freeze procedures.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Other requirements for third party verification.</E> All third party verifications shall be conducted in the same language that was used in the underlying sales transaction and shall be recorded in their entirety. In accordance with the procedures set forth in 64.1120(a)(1)(ii), submitting carriers shall maintain and preserve audio records of verification of subscriber authorization for a minimum period of two years after obtaining such verification. Automated systems must provide consumers with an option to speak with a live person at any time during the call.</P>
              <P>(4) Any State-enacted verification procedures applicable to intrastate preferred carrier change orders only.</P>
              <P>(d) Telecommunications carriers must provide subscribers the option of using one of the authorization and verification procedures specified in § 64.1120(c) in addition to an electronically signed authorization and verification procedure under 64.1120(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(e) A telecommunications carrier may acquire, through a sale or transfer, either part or all of another telecommunica- tions carrier's subscriber base without obtaining each subscriber's authorization and verification in accordance with § 64.1120(c), provided that the acquiring carrier complies with the following streamlined procedures. A telecommunications carrier may not use these streamlined procedures for any fraudulent purpose, including any attempt to avoid liability for violations under part 64, subpart K of the Commission rules.</P>
              <P>(1) No later than 30 days before the planned transfer of the affected subscribers from the selling or transferring carrier to the acquiring carrier, the acquiring carrier shall file with the Commission's Office of the Secretary a letter notification in CC Docket No. 00-257 providing the names of the parties to the transaction, the types of telecommunications services to be provided to the affected subscribers, and the date of the transfer of the subscriber base to the acquiring carrier. In the letter notification, the acquiring carrier also shall certify compliance with the requirement to provide advance subscriber notice in accordance with § 64.1120(e)(3), with the obligations specified in that notice, and with other statutory and Commission requirements that apply to this streamlined process. In addition, the acquiring carrier shall attach a copy of the notice sent to the affected subscribers.</P>
              <P>(2) If, subsequent to the filing of the letter notification with the Commission required by § 64.1120(e)(1), any material changes to the required information should develop, the acquiring carrier shall file written notification of these changes with the Commission no more than 10 days after the transfer date announced in the prior notification. The Commission reserves the right to require the acquiring carrier to send an additional notice to the affected subscribers regarding such material changes.</P>
              <P>(3) Not later than 30 days before the transfer of the affected subscribers from the selling or transferring carrier to the acquiring carrier, the acquiring carrier shall provide written notice to each affected subscriber of the information specified. The acquiring carrier is required to fulfill the obligations set forth in the advance subscriber notice. The advance subscriber notice shall be provided in a manner consistent with 47 U.S.C. 255 and the Commission's rules regarding accessibility to blind and visually-impaired consumers, 47 CFR 6.3, 6.5 of this chapter. The following information must be included in the advance subscriber notice:</P>
              <P>(i) The date on which the acquiring carrier will become the subscriber's new provider of telecommunications service,</P>

              <P>(ii) The rates, terms, and conditions of the service(s) to be provided by the acquiring carrier upon the subscriber's transfer to the acquiring carrier, and <PRTPAGE P="418"/>the means by which the acquiring carrier will notify the subscriber of any change(s) to these rates, terms, and conditions.</P>
              <P>(iii) The acquiring carrier will be responsible for any carrier change charges associated with the transfer, except where the carrier is acquiring customers by default, other than through bankruptcy, and state law requires the exiting carrier to pay these costs;</P>
              <P>(iv) The subscriber's right to select a different preferred carrier for the telecommunications service(s) at issue, if an alternative carrier is available,</P>
              <P>(v) All subscribers receiving the notice, even those who have arranged preferred carrier freezes through their local service providers on the service(s) involved in the transfer, will be transferred to the acquiring carrier, unless they have selected a different carrier before the transfer date; existing preferred carrier freezes on the service(s) involved in the transfer will be lifted; and the subscribers must contact their local service providers to arrange a new freeze.</P>
              <P>(vi) Whether the acquiring carrier will be responsible for handling any complaints filed, or otherwise raised, prior to or during the transfer against the selling or transferring carrier, and</P>
              <P>(vii) The toll-free customer service telephone number of the acquiring carrier.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Letter of agency form and content.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A telecommunications carrier may use a written or electronically signed letter of agency to obtain authorization and/or verification of a subscriber's request to change his or her preferred carrier selection. A letter of agency that does not conform with this section is invalid for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The letter of agency shall be a separate document (or an easily separable document) or located on a separate screen or webpage containing only the authorizing language described in paragraph (e) of this section having the sole purpose of authorizing a telecommunications carrier to initiate a preferred carrier change. The letter of agency must be signed and dated by the subscriber to the telephone line(s) requesting the preferred carrier change.</P>
              <P>(c) The letter of agency shall not be combined on the same document, screen, or webpage with inducements of any kind.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the letter of agency may be combined with checks that contain only the required letter of agency language as prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section and the necessary information to make the check a negotiable instrument. The letter of agency check shall not contain any promotional language or material. The letter of agency check shall contain in easily readable, bold-face type on the front of the check, a notice that the subscriber is authorizing a preferred carrier change by signing the check. The letter of agency language shall be placed near the signature line on the back of the check.</P>
              <P>(e) At a minimum, the letter of agency must be printed with a type of sufficient size and readable type to be clearly legible and must contain clear and unambiguous language that confirms:</P>
              <P>(1) The subscriber's billing name and address and each telephone number to be covered by the preferred carrier change order;</P>
              <P>(2) The decision to change the preferred carrier from the current telecommunications carrier to the soliciting telecommunications carrier;</P>
              <P>(3) That the subscriber designates [insert the name of the submitting carrier] to act as the subscriber's agent for the preferred carrier change;</P>

              <P>(4) That the subscriber understands that only one telecommunications carrier may be designated as the subscriber's interstate or interLATA preferred interexchange carrier for any one telephone number. To the extent that a jurisdiction allows the selection of additional preferred carriers (e.g., local exchange, intraLATA toll, interLATA toll, or international interexchange), the letter of agency must contain separate statements regarding <PRTPAGE P="419"/>those choices, although a separate letter of agency for each choice is not necessary; and</P>
              <P>(5) That the subscriber may consult with the carrier as to whether a fee will apply to the change in the subscriber's preferred carrier.</P>
              <P>(f) Any carrier designated in a letter of agency as a preferred carrier must be the carrier directly setting the rates for the subscriber.</P>
              <P>(g) Letters of agency shall not suggest or require that a subscriber take some action in order to retain the subscriber's current telecommunications carrier.</P>
              <P>(h) If any portion of a letter of agency is translated into another language then all portions of the letter of agency must be translated into that language. Every letter of agency must be translated into the same language as any promotional materials, oral descriptions or instructions provided with the letter of agency.</P>
              <P>(i) Letters of agency submitted with an electronically signed authorization must include the consumer disclosures required by Section 101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.</P>
              <P>(j) A telecommunications carrier shall submit a preferred carrier change order on behalf of a subscriber within no more than 60 days of obtaining a written or electronically signed letter of agency. However, letters of agency for multi-line and/or multi-location business customers that have entered into negotiated agreements with carriers to add presubscribed lines to their business locations during the course of a term agreement shall be valid for the period specified in the term agreement.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Subscriber Liability for Charges.</E> Any subscriber whose selection of telecommunications services provider is changed without authorization verified in accordance with the procedures set for in this part is liable for charges as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized change. Upon being informed by a subscriber that an unauthorized change has occurred, the authorized carrier, the unauthorized carrier, or the executing carrier shall inform the subscriber of this 30-day absolution period. Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change in accordance with the provisions of § 64.1160(e).</P>
              <P>(2) If the subscriber has already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, and the authorized carrier receives payment from the unauthorized carrier as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber any amounts determined in accordance with the provisions of § 64.1170(c).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification of alleged unauthorized carrier change.</E> Executing carriers who are informed of an unauthorized carrier <PRTPAGE P="420"/>change by a subscriber must immediately notify both the authorized and allegedly unauthorized carrier of the incident. This notification must include the identity of both carriers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Referral of complaint.</E> Any carrier, executing, authorized, or allegedly unauthorized, that is informed by a subscriber or an executing carrier of an unauthorized carrier change shall direct that subscriber either to the state commission or, where the state commission has not opted to administer these rules, to the Federal Communications Commission's Consumer &amp; Governmental Affairs Bureau, for resolution of the complaint. Carriers shall also inform the subscriber that he or she may contact and seek resolution from the alleged unauthorized carrier and, in addition, may contact the authorized carrier.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification of receipt of complaint.</E> Upon receipt of an unauthorized carrier change complaint, the relevant governmental agency will notify the allegedly unauthorized carrier of the complaint and order that the carrier remove all unpaid charges for the first 30 days after the slam from the subscriber's bill pending a determination of whether an unauthorized change, as defined by § 64.1100(e), has occurred, if it has not already done so.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Proof of verification.</E> Not more than 30 days after notification of the complaint, or such lesser time as is required by the state commission if a matter is brought before a state commission, the alleged unauthorized carrier shall provide to the relevant government agency a copy of any valid proof of verification of the carrier change. This proof of verification must contain clear and convincing evidence of a valid authorized carrier change, as that term is defined in §§ 64.1120 through 64.1130. The relevant governmental agency will determine whether an unauthorized change, as defined by § 64.1100(e), has occurred using such proof and any evidence supplied by the subscriber. Failure by the carrier to respond or provide proof of verification will be presumed to be clear and convincing evidence of a violation.</P>

              <P>(b) An allegedly unauthorized carrier shall remove all charges incurred for service provided during the first 30 days after the alleged unauthorized change occurred, as defined by § 64.1100(e), from a subscriber's bill upon notification that such unauthorized change is alleged to have occurred.</P>

              <P>(c) An allegedly unauthorized carrier may challenge a subscriber's allegation that an unauthorized change, as defined by § 64.1100(e), occurred. An allegedly unauthorized carrier choosing to challenge such allegation shall immediately notify the complaining subscriber that: The complaining subscriber must file a complaint with a State commission that has opted to administer the FCC's rules, pursuant to § 64.1110, or the FCC within 30 days of either the date of removal of charges from the complaining subscriber's bill in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or the date the allegedly unauthorized carrier notifies the complaining subscriber of the requirements of this paragraph, whichever is later; and a failure to file such a complaint within this 30-day time period will result in the charges removed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section being reinstated on the subscriber's bill and, consequently, the complaining subscriber will only be entitled to remedies for the alleged unauthorized change other than those provided for in <PRTPAGE P="421"/>§ 64.1140(b)(1). No allegedly unauthorized carrier shall reinstate charges to a subscriber's bill pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph without first providing such subscriber with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that the requisite complaint was timely filed within the 30-day period described in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(d) If the relevant governmental agency determines after reasonable investigation that an unauthorized change, as defined by § 64.1100(e), has occurred, an order shall be issued providing that the subscriber is entitled to absolution from the charges incurred during the first 30 days after the unauthorized carrier change occurred, and neither the authorized or unauthorized carrier may pursue any collection against the subscriber for those charges.</P>
              <P>(e) The Federal Communications Commission will not adjudicate a complaint filed pursuant to §§ 1.719 or §§ 1.720-1.740 of this chapter, involving an alleged unauthorized change, as defined by § 64.1100(e), while a complaint based on the same set of facts is pending with a state commission.</P>
              <P>(f) If the unauthorized carrier received payment from the subscriber for services provided after the first 30 days after the unauthorized change occurred, the obligations for payments and refunds provided for in § 64.1170 shall apply to those payments. If the relevant governmental agency determines after reasonable investigation that the carrier change was authorized, the carrier may re-bill the subscriber for charges incurred.</P>
              <P>(g) When a LEC has assigned a subscriber to a carrier without authorization, and where the subscriber has not paid the unauthorized charges, the LEC shall switch the subscriber to the desired carrier at no cost to the subscriber, and shall also secure the removal of the unauthorized charges from the subscriber's bill in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) If an authorized carrier incurs billing and collection expenses in collecting charges from the unauthorized carrier, the unauthorized carrier shall reimburse the authorized carrier for reasonable expenses.</P>

              <P>(e) If the authorized carrier has not received payment from the unauthorized carrier as required by paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized carrier is not required to provide any refund or credit to the subscriber. The <PRTPAGE P="422"/>authorized carrier must, within 45 days of receiving an order as described in paragraph (b) of this section, inform the subscriber and the relevant governmental agency that issued the order if the unauthorized carrier has failed to forward to it the appropriate charges, and also inform the subscriber of his or her right to pursue a claim against the unauthorized carrier for a refund of all charges paid to the unauthorized carrier.</P>
              <P>(f) Where possible, the properly authorized carrier must reinstate the subscriber in any premium program in which that subscriber was enrolled prior to the unauthorized change, if the subscriber's participation in that program was terminated because of the unauthorized change. If the subscriber has paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the properly authorized carrier shall also provide or restore to the subscriber any premiums to which the subscriber would have been entitled had the unauthorized change not occurred. The authorized carrier must comply with the requirements of this section regardless of whether it is able to recover from the unauthorized carrier any charges that were paid by the subscriber.</P>
              <P>(g) When a LEC has assigned a subscriber to a non-affiliated carrier without authorization, and when a subscriber has paid the non-affiliated carrier the charges for the billed service, the LEC shall reimburse the subscriber for all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier and shall switch the subscriber to the desired carrier at no cost to the subscriber. When a LEC makes an unauthorized carrier change to an affiliated carrier, and when the customer has paid the charges, the LEC must pay to the authorized carrier 150% of the amounts collected from the subscriber in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preferred carrier freezes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A preferred carrier freeze (or freeze) prevents a change in a subscriber's preferred carrier selection unless the subscriber gives the carrier from whom the freeze was requested his or her express consent. All local exchange carriers who offer preferred carrier freezes must comply with the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) All local exchange carriers who offer preferred carrier freezes shall offer freezes on a nondiscriminatory basis to all subscribers, regardless of the subscriber's carrier selections.</P>
              <P>(c) Preferred carrier freeze procedures, including any solicitation, must clearly distinguish among telecommunications services (e.g., local exchange, intraLATA toll, and interLATA toll) subject to a preferred carrier freeze. The carrier offering the freeze must obtain separate authorization for each service for which a preferred carrier freeze is requested.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Solicitation and imposition of preferred carrier freezes.</E> (1) All carrier-provided solicitation and other materials regarding preferred carrier freezes must include:</P>
              <P>(i) An explanation, in clear and neutral language, of what a preferred carrier freeze is and what services may be subject to a freeze;</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the specific procedures necessary to lift a preferred carrier freeze; an explanation that these steps are in addition to the Commission's verification rules in §§ 64.1120 and 64.1130 for changing a subscriber's preferred carrier selections; and an explanation that the subscriber will be unable to make a change in carrier selection unless he or she lifts the freeze.</P>
              <P>(iii) An explanation of any charges associated with the preferred carrier freeze.</P>
              <P>(2) No local exchange carrier shall implement a preferred carrier freeze unless the subscriber's request to impose a freeze has first been confirmed in accordance with one of the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(i) The local exchange carrier has obtained the subscriber's written or electronically signed authorization in a form that meets the requirements of § 64.1190(d)(3); or</P>

              <P>(ii) The local exchange carrier has obtained the subscriber's electronic authorization, placed from the telephone number(s) on which the preferred carrier freeze is to be imposed, to impose a preferred carrier freeze. The electronic authorization should confirm <PRTPAGE P="423"/>appropriate verification data (e.g., the subscriber's date of birth or social security number) and the information required in §§ 64.1190(d)(3)(ii)(A) through (D). Telecommunications carriers electing to confirm preferred carrier freeze orders electronically shall establish one or more toll-free telephone numbers exclusively for that purpose. Calls to the number(s) will connect a subscriber to a voice response unit, or similar mechanism that records the required information regarding the preferred carrier freeze request, including automatically recording the originating automatic numbering identification; or</P>
              <P>(iii) An appropriately qualified independent third party has obtained the subscriber's oral authorization to submit the preferred carrier freeze and confirmed the appropriate verification data (e.g., the subscriber's date of birth or social security number) and the information required in § 64.1190(d)(3)(ii)(A) through (D). The independent third party must not be owned, managed, or directly controlled by the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent; must not have any financial incentive to confirm preferred carrier freeze requests for the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent; and must operate in a location physically separate from the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent. The content of the verification must include clear and conspicuous confirmation that the subscriber has authorized a preferred carrier freeze.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Written authorization to impose a preferred carrier freeze.</E> A local exchange carrier may accept a subscriber's written and signed authorization to impose a freeze on his or her preferred carrier selection. Written authorization that does not conform with this section is invalid and may not be used to impose a preferred carrier freeze.</P>
              <P>(i) The written authorization shall comply with §§ 64.1130(b), (c), and (h) of the Commission's rules concerning the form and content for letters of agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) At a minimum, the written authorization must be printed with a readable type of sufficient size to be clearly legible and must contain clear and unambiguous language that confirms:</P>
              <P>(A) The subscriber's billing name and address and the telephone number(s) to be covered by the preferred carrier freeze;</P>
              <P>(B) The decision to place a preferred carrier freeze on the telephone number(s) and particular service(s). To the extent that a jurisdiction allows the imposition of preferred carrier freezes on additional preferred carrier selections (e.g., for local exchange, intraLATA toll, and interLATA toll), the authorization must contain separate statements regarding the particular selections to be frozen;</P>
              <P>(C) That the subscriber understands that she or he will be unable to make a change in carrier selection unless she or he lifts the preferred carrier freeze; and</P>
              <P>(D) That the subscriber understands that any preferred carrier freeze may involve a charge to the subscriber.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures for lifting preferred carrier freezes.</E> All local exchange carriers who offer preferred carrier freezes must, at a minimum, offer subscribers the following procedures for lifting a preferred carrier freeze:</P>
              <P>(1) A local exchange carrier administering a preferred carrier freeze must accept a subscriber's written or electronically signed authorization stating his or her intent to lift a preferred carrier freeze; and</P>
              <P>(2) A local exchange carrier administering a preferred carrier freeze must accept a subscriber's oral authorization stating her or his intent to lift a preferred carrier freeze and must offer a mechanism that allows a submitting carrier to conduct a three-way conference call with the carrier administering the freeze and the subscriber in order to lift a freeze. When engaged in oral authorization to lift a preferred carrier freeze, the carrier administering the freeze shall confirm appropriate verification data (e.g., the subscriber's date of birth or social security number) and the subscriber's intent to lift the particular freeze.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(i) To any emergency telephone line, including any 911 line and any emergency line of a hospital, medical physician or service office, health care facility, poison control center, or fire protection or law enforcement agency;</P>
              <P>(ii) To the telephone line of any guest room or patient room of a hospital, health care facility, elderly home, or similar establishment; or</P>
              <P>(iii) To any telephone number assigned to a paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or other radio common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call.</P>
              <P>(iv) A person will not be liable for violating the prohibition in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section when the call is placed to a wireless number that has been ported from wireline service and such call is a voice call; not knowingly made to a wireless number; and made within 15 days of the porting of the number from wireline to wireless service, provided the number is not already on the national do-not-call registry or caller's company-specific do-not-call list.</P>
              <P>(2) Initiate, or cause to be initiated, any telephone call that includes or introduces an advertisement or constitutes telemarketing, using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice, to any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, other than a call made with the prior express written consent of the called party or the prior express consent of the called party when the call is made by or on behalf of a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, or a call that delivers a “health care” message made by, or on behalf of, a “covered entity” or its “business associate,” as those terms are defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR 160.103.</P>
              <P>(3) Initiate any telephone call to any residential line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express written consent of the called party, unless the call;</P>
              <P>(i) Is made for emergency purposes;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is not made for a commercial purpose;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is made for a commercial purpose but does not include or introduce an advertisement or constitute telemarketing;</P>

              <P>(i) The unsolicited advertisement is from a sender with an established business relationship, as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, with the recipient; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The sender obtained the number of the telephone facsimile machine through—</P>

              <P>(B) A directory, advertisement, or site on the Internet to which the recipient voluntarily agreed to make available its facsimile number for public distribution. If a sender obtains the facsimile number from the recipient's own directory, advertisement, or Internet site, it will be presumed that the number was voluntarily made available for public distribution, unless such materials explicitly note that unsolicited advertisements are not accepted at the specified facsimile number. If a sender obtains the facsimile number from other sources, the sender must take reasonable steps to verify that the recipient agreed to make the number available for public distribution.</P>

              <P>(C) This clause shall not apply in the case of an unsolicited advertisement that is sent based on an established business relationship with the recipient that was in existence before July 9, 2005 if the sender also possessed the facsimile machine number of the recipient before July 9, 2005. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that if a valid established business relationship was formed prior to July 9, 2005, the sender possessed the facsimile number prior to such date as well; and<PRTPAGE P="426"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The advertisement contains a notice that informs the recipient of the ability and means to avoid future unsolicited advertisements. A notice contained in an advertisement complies with the requirements under this paragraph only if—</P>
              <P>(A) The notice is clear and conspicuous and on the first page of the advertisement;</P>
              <P>(B) The notice states that the recipient may make a request to the sender of the advertisement not to send any future advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine or machines and that failure to comply, within 30 days, with such a request meeting the requirements under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section is unlawful;</P>
              <P>(C) The notice sets forth the requirements for an opt-out request under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section;</P>
              <P>(D) The notice includes—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A domestic contact telephone number and facsimile machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the sender; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If neither the required telephone number nor facsimile machine number is a toll-free number, a separate cost-free mechanism including a Web site address or email address, for a recipient to transmit a request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the advertisement. A local telephone number also shall constitute a cost-free mechanism so long as recipients are local and will not incur any long distance or other separate charges for calls made to such number; and</P>
              <P>(E) The telephone and facsimile numbers and cost-free mechanism identified in the notice must permit an individual or business to make an opt-out request 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</P>
              <P>(iv) A request not to send future unsolicited advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine complies with the requirements under this subparagraph only if—</P>
              <P>(A) The request identifies the telephone number or numbers of the telephone facsimile machine or machines to which the request relates;</P>
              <P>(B) The request is made to the telephone number, facsimile number, Web site address or email address identified in the sender's facsimile advertisement; and</P>
              <P>(C) The person making the request has not, subsequent to such request, provided express invitation or permission to the sender, in writing or otherwise, to send such advertisements to such person at such telephone facsimile machine.</P>
              <P>(v) A sender that receives a request not to send future unsolicited advertisements that complies with paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section must honor that request within the shortest reasonable time from the date of such request, not to exceed 30 days, and is prohibited from sending unsolicited advertisements to the recipient unless the recipient subsequently provides prior express invitation or permission to the sender. The recipient's opt-out request terminates the established business relationship exemption for purposes of sending future unsolicited advertisements. If such requests are recorded or maintained by a party other than the sender on whose behalf the unsolicited advertisement is sent, the sender will be liable for any failures to honor the opt-out request.</P>
              <P>(vi) A facsimile broadcaster will be liable for violations of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, including the inclusion of opt-out notices on unsolicited advertisements, if it demonstrates a high degree of involvement in, or actual notice of, the unlawful activity and fails to take steps to prevent such facsimile transmissions.</P>
              <P>(5) Use an automatic telephone dialing system in such a way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line business are engaged simultaneously.</P>
              <P>(6) Disconnect an unanswered telemarketing call prior to at least 15 seconds or four (4) rings.</P>

              <P>(7) Abandon more than three percent of all telemarketing calls that are answered live by a person, as measured over a 30-day period for a single calling campaign. If a single calling campaign exceeds a 30-day period, the abandonment rate shall be calculated separately for each successive 30-day period or portion thereof that such calling campaign continues. A call is “abandoned” if it is not connected to a live sales representative within two (2) seconds of the called person's completed greeting.<PRTPAGE P="427"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Whenever a live sales representative is not available to speak with the person answering the call, within two (2) seconds after the called person's completed greeting, the telemarketer or the seller must provide:</P>
              <P>(A) A prerecorded identification and opt-out message that is limited to disclosing that the call was for “telemarketing purposes” and states the name of the business, entity, or individual on whose behalf the call was placed, and a telephone number for such business, entity, or individual that permits the called person to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign; provided, that, such telephone number may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges, and</P>
              <P>(B) An automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism that enables the called person to make a do-not-call request prior to terminating the call, including brief explanatory instructions on how to use such mechanism. When the called person elects to opt-out using such mechanism, the mechanism must automatically record the called person's number to the seller's do-not-call list and immediately terminate the call.</P>
              <P>(ii) A call for telemarketing purposes that delivers an artificial or prerecorded voice message to a residential telephone line or to any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section after the subscriber to such line has granted prior express written consent for the call to be made shall not be considered an abandoned call if the message begins within two (2) seconds of the called person's completed greeting.</P>
              <P>(iii) The seller or telemarketer must maintain records establishing compliance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Calls made by or on behalf of tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not covered by this paragraph (a)(7).</P>
              <P>(8) Use any technology to dial any telephone number for the purpose of determining whether the line is a facsimile or voice line.</P>
              <P>(b) All artificial or prerecorded voice telephone messages shall:</P>
              <P>(1) At the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that is responsible for initiating the call. If a business is responsible for initiating the call, the name under which the entity is registered to conduct business with the State Corporation Commission (or comparable regulatory authority) must be stated;</P>
              <P>(2) During or after the message, state clearly the telephone number (other than that of the autodialer or prerecorded message player that placed the call) of such business, other entity, or individual. The telephone number provided may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges. For telemarketing messages to residential telephone subscribers, such telephone number must permit any individual to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign; and</P>

              <P>(3) In every case where the artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message includes or introduces an advertisement or constitutes telemarketing and is delivered to a residential telephone line or any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii), provide an automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism for the called person to make a do-not-call request, including brief explanatory instructions on how to use such mechanism, within two (2) seconds of providing the identification information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the called person elects to opt out using such mechanism, the mechanism, must automatically record the called person's number to the seller's do-not-call list and immediately terminate the call. When the artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message is left on an answering machine or a voice mail service, such message must also provide a toll free number that enables the called person to call back at a later time and connect directly to the automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism and automatically record the <PRTPAGE P="428"/>called person's number to the seller's do-not-call list.</P>
              <P>(c) No person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to:</P>
              <P>(1) Any residential telephone subscriber before the hour of 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. (local time at the called party's location), or</P>
              <P>(2) A residential telephone subscriber who has registered his or her telephone number on the national do-not-call registry of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations that is maintained by the Federal Government. Such do-not-call registrations must be honored indefinitely, or until the registration is cancelled by the consumer or the telephone number is removed by the database administrator. Any person or entity making telephone solicitations (or on whose behalf telephone solicitations are made) will not be liable for violating this requirement if:</P>
              <P>(i) It can demonstrate that the violation is the result of error and that as part of its routine business practice, it meets the following standards:</P>
              <P>(A) Written procedures. It has established and implemented written procedures to comply with the national do-not-call rules;</P>
              <P>(B) Training of personnel. It has trained its personnel, and any entity assisting in its compliance, in procedures established pursuant to the national do-not-call rules;</P>
              <P>(C) Recording. It has maintained and recorded a list of telephone numbers that the seller may not contact;</P>

              <P>(D) Accessing the national do-not-call database. It uses a process to prevent telephone solicitations to any telephone number on any list established pursuant to the do-not-call rules, employing a version of the national do-not-call registry obtained from the administrator of the registry no more than 31 days prior to the date any call is made, and maintains records documenting this process.

              <P>(1) The person, based upon the most recent numbering information reported to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section, by querying the database operated by the Administrator and receiving a response of “no”, has verified that the number has not been permanently disconnected since the date prior express consent was obtained as required in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) The person's call to the number was the result of the database erroneously returning a response of “no” to the person's query consisting of the number for which prior express consent was obtained as required in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section and the date on which such prior express consent was obtained.</P>

The list must be provided on a quarterly basis. Local Exchange Carriers must verify disputed numbers in a timely manner, and must maintain verification data for 18 months after close of the compensation period.</P>
              <P>(e) Local Exchange Carriers must respond to all carrier requests for payphone number verification in connection with the compensation requirements herein, even if such verification is a negative response.</P>
              <P>(f) A payphone service provider that seeks compensation for payphones that are not included on the Local Exchange Carrier's list satisfies its obligation to provide alternative reasonable verification to a payor carrier if it provides to that carrier:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Delivery requirements and privacy restrictions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Delivery.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section:</P>

              <P>(1) Telecommunications carriers and providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, in originating interstate or intrastate traffic on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or originating interstate or intrastate traffic that is destined for the PSTN (collectively “PSTN Traffic”), are required to transmit for all PSTN Traffic the telephone number received from or assigned to or otherwise associated with the calling party to the next provider in the path from the originating provider to the terminating provider. This provision applies regardless of the voice call signaling and transmission technology used by the carrier or VoIP provider. Entities subject to this provision that use Signaling System 7 (SS7) are required to transmit the calling party number (CPN) associated with all PSTN Traffic in the SS7 ISUP (ISDN User Part) CPN field to interconnecting providers, and are required to transmit the calling party's charge number (CN) in the SS7 ISUP CN field to interconnecting providers for any PSTN Traffic where CN differs from CPN. Entities subject to this provision who use multi-frequency (MF) signaling are required to transmit CPN, or CN if it differs from CPN, associated <PRTPAGE P="446"/>with all PSTN Traffic in the MF signaling automatic numbering information (ANI) field.</P>
              <P>(2) Intermediate providers within an interstate or intrastate call path that originates and/or terminates on the PSTN must pass unaltered to subsequent providers in the call path signaling information identifying the telephone number, or billing number, if different, of the calling party that is received with a call. This requirement applies to SS7 information including but not limited to CPN and CN, and also applies to MF signaling information or other signaling information intermediate providers receive with a call. This requirement also applies to VoIP signaling messages, such as calling party and charge information identifiers contained in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header fields, and to equivalent identifying information as used in other VoIP signaling technologies, regardless of the voice call signaling and transmission technology used by the carrier or VoIP provider.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Privacy.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, originating carriers using Signaling System 7 and offering or subscribing to any service based on Signaling System 7 functionality will recognize *67 dialed as the first three digits of a call (or 1167 for rotary or pulse dialing phones) as a caller's request that the CPN not be passed on an interstate call. Such carriers providing line blocking services will recognize *82 as a caller's request that the CPN be passed on an interstate call. No common carrier subscribing to or offering any service that delivers CPN may override the privacy indicator associated with an interstate call. Carriers must arrange their CPN-based services, and billing practices, in such a manner that when a caller requests that the CPN not be passed, a carrier may not reveal that caller's number or name, nor may the carrier use the number or name to allow the called party to contact the calling party. The terminating carrier must act in accordance with the privacy indicator unless the call is made to a called party that subscribes to an ANI or charge number based service and the call is paid for by the called party.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charges.</E> No common carrier subscribing to or offering any service that delivers calling party number may</P>
              <P>(1) Impose on the calling party charges associated with per call blocking of the calling party's telephone number, or</P>
              <P>(2) Impose charges upon connecting carriers for the delivery of the calling party number parameter or its associated privacy indicator.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> Section 64.1601(a) and (b) shall not apply when:</P>
              <P>(1) A call originates from a payphone.</P>
              <P>(2) A local exchange carrier with Signaling System 7 capability does not have the software to provide *67 or *82 functionalities. Such carriers are prohibited from passing CPN.</P>
              <P>(3) A Private Branch Exchange or Centrex system does not pass end user CPN. Centrex systems that rely on *6 or *8 for a function other than CPN blocking or unblocking, respectively, are also exempt if they employ alternative means of blocking or unblocking.</P>
              <P>(4) CPN delivery—</P>
              <P>(i) Is used solely in connection with calls within the same limited system, including (but not limited to) a Centrex system, virtual private network, or Private Branch Exchange;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is used on a public agency's emergency telephone line or in conjunction with 911 emergency services, on a telephone line to contact non-public emergency services licensed by the state or municipality, or on any entity's emergency assistance poison control telephone line; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Is provided in connection with legally authorized call tracing or trapping procedures specifically requested by a law enforcement agency.</P>
              <P>(e) Any person or entity that engages in telemarketing, as defined in section 64.1200(f)(10) must transmit caller identification information.</P>

              <P>(1) For purposes of this paragraph, caller identification information must include either CPN or ANI, and, when available by the telemarketer's carrier, the name of the telemarketer. It shall not be a violation of this paragraph to substitute (for the name and phone number used in, or billed for, making the call) the name of the seller on behalf of which the telemarketing call is <PRTPAGE P="447"/>placed and the seller's customer service telephone number. The telephone number so provided must permit any individual to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours.</P>
              <P>(2) Any person or entity that engages in telemarketing is prohibited from blocking the transmission of caller identification information.</P>
              <P>(3) Tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not required to comply with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply when CPN delivery is made in connection with a threatening call. Upon report of such a threatening call by law enforcement on behalf of the threatened party, the carrier will provide any CPN of the calling party to law enforcement and, as directed by law enforcement, to security personnel for the called party for the purpose of identifying the party responsible for the threatening call.</P>
              <P>(g) For law enforcement or security personnel of the called party investigating the threat:</P>
              <P>(1) The CPN on incoming restricted calls may not be passed on to the line called;</P>
              <P>(2) Any system used to record CPN must be operated in a secure way, limiting access to designated telecommunications and security personnel, as directed by law enforcement;</P>
              <P>(3) Telecommunications and security personnel, as directed by law enforcement, may access restricted CPN data only when investigating phone calls of a threatening and serious nature, and shall document that access as part of the investigative report;</P>
              <P>(4) Carriers transmitting restricted CPN information must take reasonable measures to ensure security of such communications;</P>
              <P>(5) CPN information must be destroyed in a secure manner after a reasonable retention period; and</P>
              <P>(6) Any violation of these conditions must be reported promptly to the Commission.</P>

Section 273(d) sets forth procedures to be followed by non-accredited standards development organizations when these organizations set industry-wide standards and generic requirements for telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment. The statutory procedures allow outside parties to fund and participate in setting the organization's standards and require the organization and the parties to develop a process for resolving any technical disputes. In cases where all parties cannot agree to a mutually satisfactory dispute resolution process, section 273(d)(5) requires the Commission to prescribe a dispute resolution process.</P>

The tri-partite panel must adopt one of the five options listed below:</P>
              <P>(i) The NASDO's proposal on the issue under consideration;</P>

              <P>(6) The tri-partite panel must choose, from the five options outlined above, the option that they believe provides the most technically sound solution and base its recommendation upon the substantive evidence presented to the panel. The panel is not precluded from taking into account complexity of implementation and other practical considerations in deciding which option is most technically sound. Neither of the disputants (i.e., the NASDO and the funding party which invokes the dispute resolution process) will be permitted to participate in any decision to reject the mediation panel's recommendation.</P>
              <P>(b) The tri-partite panel's recommendation(s) must be included in the final industry-wide standard or industry-wide generic requirement, unless three-fourths of the funding parties who vote decide within thirty (30) days of the filing of the dispute to reject the recommendation and accept one of the options specified in paragraphs (a)(5) (i) through (v) of this section. Each funding party shall have one vote.</P>
              <P>(c) All costs sustained by the tri-partite panel will be incorporated into the cost of producing the industry-wide standard or industry-wide generic requirement.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of these rules is to regulate the provision of in-region, interstate, domestic, interexchange services and in-region international interexchange services by incumbent independent local exchange carriers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Terms and definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Terms used in this part have the following meanings:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Books of account.</E> Books of account refer to the financial accounting system a company uses to record, in monetary terms, the basic transactions of a company. These books of account reflect the company's assets, liabilities, and equity, and the revenues and expenses from operations. Each company has its own separate books of account.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Incumbent Independent Local Exchange Carrier</E> (Incumbent Independent LEC). The term incumbent independent local exchange carrier means, with respect to an area, the independent local exchange carrier that:</P>
              <P>(1) On February 8, 1996, provided telephone exchange service in such area; and</P>
              <P>(2)(i) On February 8, 1996, was deemed to be a member of the exchange carrier association pursuant to § 69.601(b) of this title; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Is a person or entity that, on or after February 8, 1996, became a successor or assign of a member described in paragraph (2)(i) of this section. The Commission may also, by rule, treat an independent local exchange carrier as an incumbent independent local exchange carrier pursuant to section 251(h)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Independent Local Exchange Carrier</E> (Independent LEC). Independent local exchange carriers are local exchange carriers, including GTE, other than the BOCs.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Independent Local Exchange Carrier Affiliate</E> (Independent LEC Affiliate). An independent local exchange carrier affiliate is a carrier that is owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by, or under common ownership (in whole or in part) or control with, an independent local exchange carrier.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">In-region service.</E> In-region service means telecommunications service originating in an independent local exchange carrier's local service areas or 800 service, private line service, or their equivalents that:</P>
              <P>(1) Terminate in the independent LEC's local exchange areas; and</P>
              <P>(2) Allow the called party to determine the interexchange carrier, even if the service originates outside the independent LEC's local exchange areas.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Local Exchange Carrier.</E> The term local exchange carrier means any person that is engaged in the provision of telephone exchange service or exchange access. Such term does not include a person insofar as such person is engaged in the provision of a commercial mobile service under section 332(c), except to the extent that the Commission finds that such service should be included in the definition of that term.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Obligations of all incumbent independent local exchange carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An incumbent independent LEC providing in-region, interstate, interexchange services or in-region international interexchange services shall provide such services through an affiliate that satisfies the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The affiliate shall maintain separate books of account from its affiliated exchange companies. Nothing in this section requires the affiliate to maintain separate books of account that comply with part 32 of this title;</P>

              <P>(2) The affiliate shall not jointly own transmission or switching facilities with its affiliated exchange companies. <PRTPAGE P="452"/>Nothing in this section prohibits an affiliate from sharing personnel or other resources or assets with an affiliated exchange company; and</P>
              <P>(3) The affiliate shall acquire any services from its affiliated exchange companies for which the affiliated exchange companies are required to file a tariff at tariffed rates, terms, and conditions. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the affiliate from acquiring any unbundled network elements or exchange services for the provision of a telecommunications service from its affiliated exchange companies, subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in an agreement approved under section 252 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the affiliate required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be a separate legal entity from its affiliated exchange companies. The affiliate may be staffed by personnel of its affiliated exchange companies, housed in existing offices of its affiliated exchange companies, and use its affiliated exchange companies' marketing and other services, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) For an incumbent independent LEC that provides in-region, interstate domestic interexchange services or in-region international interexchange services using no interexchange switching or transmission facilities or capability of the LEC's own (i.e., “independent LEC reseller,”) the affiliate required in paragraph (a) of this section may be a separate corporate division of such incumbent independent LEC. All other provisions of this Subpart applicable to an independent LEC affiliate shall continue to apply, as applicable, to such separate corporate division.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of customer proprietary network information without customer approval.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Any telecommunications carrier may use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI for the purpose of providing or marketing service offerings among the categories of service (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> local, interexchange, and CMRS) to which the customer already subscribes from the same carrier, without customer approval.</P>

              <P>(1) If a telecommunications carrier provides different categories of service, and a customer subscribes to more than one category of service offered by the carrier, the carrier is permitted to <PRTPAGE P="454"/>share CPNI among the carrier's affiliated entities that provide a service offering to the customer.</P>
              <P>(2) If a telecommunications carrier provides different categories of service, but a customer does not subscribe to more than one offering by the carrier, the carrier is not permitted to share CPNI with its affiliates, except as provided in § 64.2007(b).</P>

              <P>(2) A telecommunications carrier must maintain records of notification, whether oral, written or electronic, for at least one year.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Content of notice.</E> Customer notification must provide sufficient information to enable the customer to make an informed decision as to whether to permit a carrier to use, disclose, or permit access to, the customer's CPNI.</P>
              <P>(1) The notification must state that the customer has a right, and the carrier has a duty, under federal law, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI.</P>
              <P>(2) The notification must specify the types of information that constitute CPNI and the specific entities that will receive the CPNI, describe the purposes for which CPNI will be used, and inform the customer of his or her right to disapprove those uses, and deny or withdraw access to CPNI at any time.</P>
              <P>(3) The notification must advise the customer of the precise steps the customer must take in order to grant or deny access to CPNI, and must clearly state that a denial of approval will not affect the provision of any services to which the customer subscribes. However, carriers may provide a brief statement, in clear and neutral language, describing consequences directly resulting from the lack of access to CPNI.</P>
              <P>(4) The notification must be comprehensible and must not be misleading.</P>
              <P>(5) If written notification is provided, the notice must be clearly legible, use sufficiently large type, and be placed in an area so as to be readily apparent to a customer.</P>
              <P>(6) If any portion of a notification is translated into another language, then all portions of the notification must be translated into that language.</P>
              <P>(7) A carrier may state in the notification that the customer's approval to use CPNI may enhance the carrier's ability to offer products and services tailored to the customer's needs. A carrier also may state in the notification that it may be compelled to disclose CPNI to any person upon affirmative written request by the customer.</P>
              <P>(8) A carrier may not include in the notification any statement attempting to encourage a customer to freeze third-party access to CPNI.</P>
              <P>(9) The notification must state that any approval, or denial of approval for the use of CPNI outside of the service to which the customer already subscribes from that carrier is valid until the customer affirmatively revokes or limits such approval or denial.</P>
              <P>(10) A telecommunications carrier's solicitation for approval must be proximate to the notification of a customer's CPNI rights.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice requirements specific to opt-out.</E> A telecommunications carrier must provide notification to obtain opt out approval through electronic or written methods, but not by oral communication (except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section). The contents of any such notification must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Carriers must wait a 30-day minimum period of time after giving customers notice and an opportunity to opt-out before assuming customer approval to use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI. A carrier may, in its discretion, provide for a longer period. Carriers must notify customers as to the applicable waiting period for a response before approval is assumed.</P>

              <P>(i) In the case of an electronic form of notification, the waiting period shall <PRTPAGE P="456"/>begin to run from the date on which the notification was sent; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of notification by mail, the waiting period shall begin to run on the third day following the date that the notification was mailed.</P>
              <P>(2) Carriers using the opt-out mechanism must provide notices to their customers every two years.</P>
              <P>(3) Telecommunications carriers that use email to provide opt-out notices must comply with the following requirements in addition to the requirements generally applicable to notification:</P>
              <P>(i) Carriers must obtain express, verifiable, prior approval from consumers to send notices via email regarding their service in general, or CPNI in particular;</P>
              <P>(ii) Carriers must allow customers to reply directly to emails containing CPNI notices in order to opt-out;</P>
              <P>(iii) Opt-out email notices that are returned to the carrier as undeliverable must be sent to the customer in another form before carriers may consider the customer to have received notice;</P>
              <P>(iv) Carriers that use email to send CPNI notices must ensure that the subject line of the message clearly and accurately identifies the subject matter of the email; and</P>
              <P>(v) Telecommunications carriers must make available to every customer a method to opt-out that is of no additional cost to the customer and that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Carriers may satisfy this requirement through a combination of methods, so long as all customers have the ability to opt-out at no cost and are able to effectuate that choice whenever they choose.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice requirements specific to opt-in.</E> A telecommunications carrier may provide notification to obtain opt-in approval through oral, written, or electronic methods. The contents of any such notification must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice requirements specific to one-time use of CPNI.</E> (1) Carriers may use oral notice to obtain limited, one-time use of CPNI for inbound and outbound customer telephone contacts for the duration of the call, regardless of whether carriers use opt-out or opt-in approval based on the nature of the contact.</P>

              <P>(ii) Carriers need not advise customers that they may share CPNI with their affiliates or third parties and need not name those entities, if the limited CPNI usage will not result in use by, or disclosure to, an affiliate or third party;</P>
              <P>(iii) Carriers need not disclose the means by which a customer can deny or withdraw future access to CPNI, so long as carriers explain to customers that the scope of the approval the carrier seeks is limited to one-time use; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Safeguards required for use of customer proprietary network information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Telecommunications carriers must implement a system by which the status of a customer's CPNI approval can be clearly established prior to the use of CPNI.</P>
              <P>(b) Telecommunications carriers must train their personnel as to when they are and are not authorized to use CPNI, and carriers must have an express disciplinary process in place.</P>

              <P>(c) All carriers shall maintain a record, electronically or in some other manner, of their own and their affiliates' sales and marketing campaigns that use their customers' CPNI. All carriers shall maintain a record of all instances where CPNI was disclosed or provided to third parties, or where third parties were allowed access to <PRTPAGE P="457"/>CPNI. The record must include a description of each campaign, the specific CPNI that was used in the campaign, and what products and services were offered as a part of the campaign. Carriers shall retain the record for a minimum of one year.</P>
              <P>(d) Telecommunications carriers must establish a supervisory review process regarding carrier compliance with the rules in this subpart for outbound marketing situations and maintain records of carrier compliance for a minimum period of one year. Specifically, sales personnel must obtain supervisory approval of any proposed outbound marketing request for customer approval.</P>
              <P>(e) A telecommunications carrier must have an officer, as an agent of the carrier, sign and file with the Commission a compliance certificate on an annual basis. The officer must state in the certification that he or she has personal knowledge that the company has established operating procedures that are adequate to ensure compliance with the rules in this subpart. The carrier must provide a statement accompanying the certificate explaining how its operating procedures ensure that it is or is not in compliance with the rules in this subpart. In addition, the carrier must include an explanation of any actions taken against data brokers and a summary of all customer complaints received in the past year concerning the unauthorized release of CPNI. This filing must be made annually with the Enforcement Bureau on or before March 1 in EB Docket No. 06-36, for data pertaining to the previous calendar year.</P>
              <P>(f) Carriers must provide written notice within five business days to the Commission of any instance where the opt-out mechanisms do not work properly, to such a degree that consumers' inability to opt-out is more than an anomaly.</P>
              <P>(1) The notice shall be in the form of a letter, and shall include the carrier's name, a description of the opt-out mechanism(s) used, the problem(s) experienced, the remedy proposed and when it will be/was implemented, whether the relevant state commission(s) has been notified and whether it has taken any action, a copy of the notice provided to customers, and contact information.</P>
              <P>(2) Such notice must be submitted even if the carrier offers other methods by which consumers may opt-out.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Safeguards on the disclosure of customer proprietary network information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Safeguarding CPNI.</E> Telecommunications carriers must take reasonable measures to discover and protect against attempts to gain unauthorized access to CPNI. Telecommunications carriers must properly authenticate a customer prior to disclosing CPNI based on customer-initiated telephone contact, online account access, or an in-store visit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Telephone access to CPNI.</E> Telecommunications carriers may only disclose call detail information over the telephone, based on customer-initiated telephone contact, if the customer first provides the carrier with a password, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, that is not prompted by the carrier asking for readily available biographical information, or account information. If the customer does not provide a password, the telecommunications carrier may only disclose call detail information by sending it to the customer's address of record, or by calling the customer at the telephone number of record. If the customer is able to provide call detail information to the telecommunications carrier during a customer-initiated call without the telecommunications carrier's assistance, then the telecommunications carrier is permitted to discuss the call detail information provided by the customer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Online access to CPNI.</E> A telecommunications carrier must authenticate a customer without the use of readily available biographical information, or account information, prior to allowing the customer online access to CPNI related to a telecommunications service account. Once authenticated, the customer may only obtain online access to CPNI related to a telecommunications service account through a password, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, that is not prompted by the carrier asking for <PRTPAGE P="458"/>readily available biographical information, or account information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">In-store access to CPNI.</E> A telecommunications carrier may disclose CPNI to a customer who, at a carrier's retail location, first presents to the telecommunications carrier or its agent a valid photo ID matching the customer's account information.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Establishment of a password and back-up authentication methods for lost or forgotten passwords.</E> To establish a password, a telecommunications carrier must authenticate the customer without the use of readily available biographical information, or account information. Telecommunications carriers may create a back-up customer authentication method in the event of a lost or forgotten password, but such back-up customer authentication method may not prompt the customer for readily available biographical information, or account information. If a customer cannot provide the correct password or the correct response for the back-up customer authentication method, the customer must establish a new password as described in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification of account changes.</E> Telecommunications carriers must notify customers immediately whenever a password, customer response to a back-up means of authentication for lost or forgotten passwords, online account, or address of record is created or changed. This notification is not required when the customer initiates service, including the selection of a password at service initiation. This notification may be through a carrier-originated voicemail or text message to the telephone number of record, or by mail to the address of record, and must not reveal the changed information or be sent to the new account information.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Business customer exemption.</E> Telecommunications carriers may bind themselves contractually to authentication regimes other than those described in this section for services they provide to their business customers that have both a dedicated account representative and a contract that specifically addresses the carriers' protection of CPNI.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notification of customer proprietary network information security breaches.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A telecommunications carrier shall notify law enforcement of a breach of its customers' CPNI as provided in this section. The carrier shall not notify its customers or disclose the breach publicly, whether voluntarily or under state or local law or these rules, until it has completed the process of notifying law enforcement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) As soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven (7) business days, after reasonable determination of the breach, the telecommunications carrier shall electronically notify the United States Secret Service (USSS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through a central reporting facility. The Commission will maintain a link to the reporting facility at <E T="03">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/cpni.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, the carrier shall not notify customers or disclose the breach to the public until 7 full business days have passed after notification to the USSS and the FBI except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the carrier believes that there is an extraordinarily urgent need to notify any class of affected customers sooner than otherwise allowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in order to avoid immediate and irreparable harm, it shall so indicate in its notification and may proceed to immediately notify its affected customers only after consultation with the relevant investigating agency. The carrier shall cooperate with the relevant investigating agency's request to minimize any adverse effects of such customer notification.</P>

              <P>(3) If the relevant investigating agency determines that public disclosure or notice to customers would impede or compromise an ongoing or potential criminal investigation or national security, such agency may direct the carrier not to so disclose or notify for an initial period of up to 30 days. Such period may be extended by the agency as reasonably necessary in the judgment of the agency. If such direction is <PRTPAGE P="459"/>given, the agency shall notify the carrier when it appears that public disclosure or notice to affected customers will no longer impede or compromise a criminal investigation or national security. The agency shall provide in writing its initial direction to the carrier, any subsequent extension, and any notification that notice will no longer impede or compromise a criminal investigation or national security and such writings shall be contemporaneously logged on the same reporting facility that contains records of notifications filed by carriers.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Customer notification.</E> After a telecommunications carrier has completed the process of notifying law enforcement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, it shall notify its customers of a breach of those customers' CPNI.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> All carriers shall maintain a record, electronically or in some other manner, of any breaches discovered, notifications made to the USSS and the FBI pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and notifications made to customers. The record must include, if available, dates of discovery and notification, a detailed description of the CPNI that was the subject of the breach, and the circumstances of the breach. Carriers shall retain the record for a minimum of 2 years.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section, a “breach” has occurred when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.</P>
              <P>(f) This section does not supersede any statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in any State, except to the extent that such statute, regulation, order, or interpretation is inconsistent with the provisions of this section, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Truth-in-Billing Requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Bill organization.</E> Telephone bills shall be clearly organized, and must comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The name of the service provider associated with each charge must be clearly and conspicuously identified on the telephone bill.</P>
              <P>(2) Where charges for two or more carriers appear on the same telephone bill, the charges must be separated by service provider.</P>
              <P>(3) Carriers that place on their telephone bills charges from third parties for non-telecommunications services must place those charges in a distinct section of the bill separate from all carrier charges. Charges in each distinct section of the bill must be separately subtotaled. These separate subtotals for carrier and non-carrier charges also must be clearly and conspicuously displayed along with the bill total on the payment page of a paper bill or equivalent location on an electronic bill. For purposes of this subparagraph “equivalent location on an electronic bill” shall mean any location on an electronic bill where the bill total is displayed and any location where the bill total is displayed before the bill recipient accesses the complete electronic bill, such as in an electronic mail message notifying the bill recipient of the bill and an electronic link or notice on a Web site or electronic payment portal.</P>
              <P>(4) The telephone bill must clearly and conspicuously identify any change in service provider, including identification of charges from any new service provider. For purpose of this subparagraph “new service provider” means a service provider that did not bill the subscriber for service during the service provider's last billing cycle. This definition shall include only providers that have continuing relationships with the subscriber that will result in periodic charges on the subscriber's bill, unless the service is subsequently canceled.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Descriptions of billed charges.</E> Charges contained on telephone bills must be accompanied by a brief, clear, non-misleading, plain language description of the service or services rendered. The description must be sufficiently clear in presentation and specific enough in content so that customers can accurately assess that the services for which they are billed correspond to those that they have requested and received, and that the costs assessed for those services conform to their understanding of the price charged.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">“Deniable” and “Non-Deniable” Charges.</E> Where a bill contains charges for basic local service, in addition to other charges, the bill must distinguish between charges for which non-payment will result in disconnection of basic, local service, and charges for which non-payment will not result in such disconnection. The carrier must explain this distinction to the customer, and must clearly and conspicuously identify on the bill those charges for which non-payment will not result in disconnection of basic, local service. Carriers may also elect to devise other methods of informing consumers on the bill that they may contest charges prior to payment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous disclosure of inquiry contacts.</E> Telephone bills must contain clear and conspicuous disclosure of any information that the subscriber may need to make inquiries about, or contest, charges on the bill. Common carriers must prominently display on each bill a toll-free number or numbers by which subscribers may inquire or dispute any charges on the bill. A carrier may list a toll-free number for a billing agent, clearinghouse, or other third party, provided such party possesses sufficient information to answer questions concerning the <PRTPAGE P="469"/>subscriber's account and is fully authorized to resolve the consumer's complaints on the carrier's behalf. Where the subscriber does not receive a paper copy of his or her telephone bill, but instead accesses that bill only by e-mail or internet, the carrier may comply with this requirement by providing on the bill an e-mail or web site address. Each carrier must make a business address available upon request from a consumer.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Definition of clear and conspicuous.</E> For purposes of this section, “clear and conspicuous” means notice that would be apparent to the reasonable consumer.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Blocking of third-party charges.</E> (1) Carriers that offer subscribers the option to block third-party charges from appearing on telephone bills must clearly and conspicuously notify subscribers of this option at the point of sale and on each carrier's Web site.</P>
              <P>(2) Carriers that offer subscribers the option to block third-party charges from appearing on telephone bills must clearly and conspicuously notify subscribers of this option on each telephone bill.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Prohibition against unauthorized charges.</E> Carriers shall not place or cause to be placed on any telephone bill charges that have not been authorized by the subscriber.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notification obligations of LECs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>To the extent that the information is reasonably available to a LEC, the LEC shall provide to an IXC the customer account information described in this section consistent with § 64.4004. Nothing in this section shall prevent a LEC from providing additional customer account information to an IXC to the extent that such additional information is necessary for billing purposes or to properly execute a customer's PIC order.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Customer-submitted PIC order.</E> Upon receiving and processing a PIC selection submitted by a customer and placing the customer on the network of the customer's preferred interexchange carrier at the LEC's local switch, the LEC must notify the IXC of this event. The notification provided by the LEC to the IXC must contain all of the customer account information necessary to allow for proper billing of the customer by the IXC including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone number, and billing name and address;</P>
              <P>(2) The effective date of the PIC change;</P>
              <P>(3) A statement describing the customer type (i.e., business or residential);</P>
              <P>(4) A statement indicating, to the extent appropriate, that the customer's telephone service listing is not printed in a directory and is not available from directory assistance or is not printed in a directory but is available from directory assistance;</P>
              <P>(5) The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international);</P>
              <P>(6) The carrier identification code of the IXC; and</P>
              <P>(7) If relevant, a statement indicating that the customer's account is subject to a PIC freeze. The notification also must contain information, if relevant and to the extent that it is available, reflecting the fact that a customer's PIC selection was the result of:</P>
              <P>(i) A move (an end user customer has moved from one location to another within a LEC's service territory);</P>
              <P>(ii) A change in responsible billing party; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The resolution of a PIC dispute.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Confirmation of IXC-submitted PIC order.</E> When a LEC has placed a customer on an IXC's network at the local switch in response to an IXC-submitted PIC order, the LEC must send a confirmation to the submitting IXC. The confirmation provided by the LEC to the IXC must include:</P>
              <P>(1) The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone number, and billing name and address;</P>
              <P>(2) The effective date of the PIC change;</P>
              <P>(3) A statement describing the customer type (i.e., business or residential);</P>
              <P>(4) A statement indicating, to the extent appropriate, if the customer's telephone service listing is not printed in a directory and is not available from directory assistance, or is not printed in a directory but is available from directory assistance;</P>
              <P>(5) The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</P>
              <P>(6) The carrier identification code of the IXC. If the PIC order at issue originally was submitted by an underlying IXC on behalf of a toll reseller, the confirmation provided by the LEC to the IXC must indicate, to the extent that this information is known, a statement indicating that the customer's PIC is a toll reseller.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rejection of IXC-submitted PIC order.</E> When a LEC rejects or otherwise does not act upon a PIC order submitted to it by an IXC, the LEC must notify the IXC and provide the reason(s) why the PIC order could not be processed. The notification provided by the LEC to the IXC must state that it has rejected the IXC-submitted PIC order and specify the reason(s) for the rejection (e.g., due to a lack of information, incorrect information, or a PIC freeze on the customer's account). The notification must contain the identical data elements that were provided to the LEC in the original IXC-submitted PIC order (i.e., mirror image of the original order), unless otherwise specified by this paragraph. If a LEC rejects an IXC-submitted PIC order for a multi-line account (i.e., the customer has selected the IXC as his PIC for two <PRTPAGE P="475"/>or more lines or terminals associated with his billing telephone number), the notification provided by the LEC rejecting that order must explain the effect of the rejection with respect to each line (working telephone number or terminal) associated with the customer's billing telephone number. A LEC is not required to generate a line-specific or terminal-specific response, however, and may communicate the rejection at the billing telephone level, when the LEC is unable to process an entire order, including all working telephone numbers and terminals associated with a particular billing telephone number. In addition, the notification must indicate the jurisdictional scope of the PIC order rejection (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international). If a LEC rejects a PIC order because:</P>
              <P>(1) The customer's telephone number has been ported to another LEC; or</P>
              <P>(2) The customer has otherwise changed local service providers, the LEC must include in its notification, to the extent that it is available, the identity of the customer's new LEC.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer contacts LEC or new IXC to change PIC(s) or customer contacts LEC or current IXC to change PIC to No-PIC.</E> When a LEC has removed at its local switch a presubscribed customer from an IXC's network in response to a customer order, upon receipt of a properly verified PIC order submitted by another IXC, or in response to a notification from the customer's current IXC relating to the customer's request to change his or her PIC to No-PIC, the LEC must notify the customer's former IXC of this event. The LEC must provide to the IXC the customer account information that is necessary to allow for proper final billing of the customer by the IXC including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone number, and billing name and address;</P>
              <P>(2) The effective date of the PIC change;</P>
              <P>(3) A description of the customer type (i.e., business or residential);</P>
              <P>(4) The jurisdictional scope of the lines or terminals affected (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</P>
              <P>(5) The carrier identification code of the IXC. If a customer changes PICs but retains the same LEC, the LEC is responsible for notifying both the old PIC and new PIC of the PIC change. The notification also must contain information, if relevant and to the extent that it is available, reflecting the fact that a customer's PIC removal was the result of:</P>
              <P>(i) The customer moving from one location to another within the LEC's service territory, but where there is no change in local service provider;</P>
              <P>(ii) A change of responsible party on an account; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A disputed PIC selection.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Particular changes to customer's local service account.</E> When, according to a LEC's records, certain account or line information changes occur on a presubscribed customer's account, the LEC must communicate this information to the customer's PIC. For purposes of this paragraph, the LEC must provide to the appropriate IXC account change information that is necessary for the IXC to issue timely and accurate bills to its customers including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone number, and billing name and address;</P>
              <P>(2) The customer code assigned to that customer by the LEC;</P>
              <P>(3) The type of customer account (i.e., business or residential);</P>
              <P>(4) The status of the customer's telephone service listing, to the extent appropriate, as not printed in a directory and not available from directory assistance, or not printed in a directory but available from directory assistance; and</P>
              <P>(5) The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international);</P>
              <P>(6) The effective date of any change to a customer's local service account; and</P>

              <P>(7) The carrier identification code of the IXC. If there are changes to the customer's billing or working telephone number, customer code, or customer type, the LEC must supply both the old and new information for each of these categories.<PRTPAGE P="476"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Local service disconnection.</E> Upon receipt of an end user customer's request to terminate his entire local service account or disconnect one or more lines (but not all lines) of a multi-line account, the LEC must notify the PIC(s) for the billing telephone number or working telephone number on the account of the account termination or lines disconnected. In conjunction with this notification requirement, the LEC must provide to a customer's PIC(s) all account termination or single/multi-line disconnection change information necessary for the PIC(s) to maintain accurate billing and PIC records, including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) The effective date of the termination/disconnection; and</P>
              <P>(2) The customer's working and billing telephone numbers and billing name and address;</P>
              <P>(3) The type of customer account (i.e., business or residential);</P>
              <P>(4) The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</P>
              <P>(5) The carrier identification code of the IXC.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Change of local service provider.</E> When a customer changes LECs, the customer's former LEC must notify the customer's PIC(s) of the customer's change in LEC and, if known, the identity of the customer's new LEC. If the customer also makes a PIC change, the customer's former LEC must also notify the customer's former PIC(s) of the change. When a customer only changes LECs, the new LEC must notify the customer's current PIC(s) that the customer's PIC selection has not changed. If the customer also makes a PIC change, the new LEC must notify the customer's new PIC of the customer's PIC selection. If the customer's former LEC is unable to identify the customer's new LEC, the former LEC must notify the customer's PIC(s) of a local service disconnection as described in paragraph (f).</P>
              <P>(1) The required notifications also must contain information, if relevant and to the extent that it is available, reflecting the fact that an account change was the result of:</P>
              <P>(i) The customer porting his number to a new LEC;</P>
              <P>(ii) A local resale arrangement (customer has transferred to local reseller); or</P>
              <P>(iii) The discontinuation of a local resale arrangement;</P>
              <P>(2) The notification provided by the LEC to the IXC must include:</P>
              <P>(i) The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone number, and, billing name and address;</P>
              <P>(ii) The effective date of the change of local service providers or PIC change;</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the customer type (i.e., business or residential);</P>
              <P>(iv) The jurisdictional scope of the lines or terminals affected (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</P>
              <P>(v) The carrier identification code of the IXC.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">IXC requests for customer BNA information.</E> Upon the request of an IXC, a LEC must provide the billing name and address information necessary to facilitate a customer's receipt of a timely, accurate bill for services rendered and/or to prevent fraud, regardless of the type of service the end user receives/has received from the requesting carrier (i.e., presubscribed, dial-around, casual). In response to an IXC's BNA request for ANI, a LEC must provide the BNA for the submitted ANI along with:</P>
              <P>(1) The working telephone number for the ANI;</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the BNA response;</P>
              <P>(3) The carrier identification code of the submitting IXC; and</P>

              <P>(4) A statement indicating, to the extent appropriate, if the customer's telephone service listing is not printed in a directory and is not available from directory assistance, or is not printed in a directory but is available from directory assistance. A LEC that is unable to provide the BNA requested must provide the submitting carrier with the identical information contained in the original BNA request (i.e., the mirror image of the original request), along with the specific reason(s) why the requested information could not be provided. If the BNA is not available because the customer has changed local service providers or <PRTPAGE P="477"/>ported his telephone number, the LEC must include the identity of the new provider when this information is available.</P>

              <P>To the extent that the information is reasonably available to an IXC, the IXC shall provide to a LEC the customer account information described in this section consistent with § 64.4004.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">IXC-submitted PIC Order.</E> When a customer contacts an IXC to establish interexchange service on a presubscribed basis, the IXC selected must submit the customer's properly verified PIC Order (<E T="03">see</E> 47 CFR 64.1120(a)) to the customer's LEC, instructing the LEC to install or change the PIC for the customer's line(s) to that IXC. The notification provided by the IXC to the LEC must contain all of the information necessary to properly execute the Order including but not limited to:</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Customer contacts IXC to cancel PIC and to select no-PIC status.</E> When an end user customer contacts an IXC to discontinue interexchange service on a presubscribed basis, the IXC must confirm that it is the customer's desire to have no PIC and, if that is the case, the IXC must notify the customer's LEC. The IXC also is encouraged to instruct the customer to notify his LEC. An IXC may satisfy this requirement by establishing a three-way call with the customer and the customer's LEC to confirm that it is the customer's desire to have no PIC and, where appropriate, to provide the customer the opportunity to withdraw any PIC freeze that may be in place. The notification provided by the IXC to the LEC must contain the customer account information necessary to properly execute the cancellation Order including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) The customer's billing telephone number or working telephone number associated with the lines or terminals that are affected;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of customer proprietary network information without customer approval.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A TRS provider may use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI for the purpose of providing or lawfully marketing service offerings among the categories of service (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> type of TRS) for which the TRS provider is currently the default provider for that customer, without customer approval.</P>
              <P>(1) If a TRS provider provides different categories of TRS, and the TRS provider is currently the default provider for that customer for more than one category of TRS offered by the TRS provider, the TRS provider may share CPNI among the TRS provider's affiliated entities that provide a TRS offering to the customer.</P>
              <P>(2) If a TRS provider provides different categories of TRS, but the TRS provider is currently not the default provider for that customer for more than one offering by the TRS provider, the TRS provider shall not share CPNI with its affiliates, except as provided in § 64.5107(b) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) A TRS provider shall not use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI as described in this paragraph (b).</P>
              <P>(1) A TRS provider shall not use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI to market to a customer TRS offerings that are within a category of TRS for which the TRS provider is not currently the default provider for that customer, unless that TRS provider has customer approval to do so.</P>
              <P>(2) A TRS provider shall not identify or track CPNI of customers that call competing TRS providers and, notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a TRS provider shall not use, disclose or permit access to CPNI related to a customer call to a competing TRS provider.</P>
              <P>(c) A TRS provider may use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI, without customer approval, as described in this paragraph (c).</P>
              <P>(1) A TRS provider may use, disclose or permit access to CPNI derived from its provision of TRS without customer approval, for the provision of CPE or iTRS access technology, and call answering, voice or video mail or messaging, voice or video storage and retrieval services.</P>

              <P>(3) A TRS provider may use CPNI, without customer approval, to market services formerly known as adjunct-to-basic services, such as, but not limited to, speed dialing, call waiting, caller I.D., and call forwarding, only to those customers that are currently registered with that TRS provider as their default provider.</P>
              <P>(4) A TRS provider shall use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI to the extent necessary to:</P>
              <P>(i) Accept and handle 911/E911 calls;</P>

              <P>(a) A TRS provider may obtain approval through written, oral, electronic, or sign language methods.</P>
              <P>(1) A TRS provider relying on oral or sign language approval shall bear the burden of demonstrating that such approval has been given in compliance with the Commission's rules in this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Approval or disapproval to use, disclose, or permit access to a customer's CPNI obtained by a TRS provider must remain in effect until the customer revokes or limits such approval or disapproval.

              <P>(3) A TRS provider must maintain records of approval, whether oral, written, electronic, or sign language, during the time period that the approval or disapproval is in effect and for at least one year thereafter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of opt-in and opt-out approval processes.</E> (1) Opt-in approval requires that the TRS provider obtain from the customer affirmative, express consent allowing the requested CPNI usage, disclosure, or access after the customer is provided appropriate notification of the TRS provider's request consistent with the requirements set forth in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) With opt-out approval, a customer is deemed to have consented to the use, disclosure, or access to the customer's CPNI if the customer has failed to object thereto within the waiting period described in § 64.5108(d)(1) of this subpart after the TRS provider has provided to the customer appropriate notification of the TRS provider's request for consent consistent with the rules in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) A TRS provider may only use, disclose, or permit access to the customer's individually identifiable CPNI with the customer's opt-in approval, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Where a TRS provider is permitted to use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI without customer approval under § 64.5105 of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(4) A TRS provider may make use of customer opt-in or opt-out approval to take the following actions with respect to CPNI:</P>
              <P>(i) Use its customer's individually identifiable CPNI for the purpose of lawfully marketing TRS-related services to that customer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Disclose its customer's individually identifiable CPNI to its agents and its affiliates that provide TRS-related services for the purpose of lawfully marketing TRS-related services to that customer.

              <SUBJECT>Notice required for use of customer proprietary network information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification, generally.</E> (1) Prior to any solicitation for customer approval to use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI, a TRS provider shall provide notification to the customer of the customer's right to deny or restrict use of, disclosure of, and access to that customer's CPNI.</P>
              <P>(2) A TRS provider shall maintain records of notification, whether oral, written, electronic, or sign language, during the time period that the approval is in effect and for at least one year thereafter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Individual notice.</E> A TRS provider shall provide individual notice to customers when soliciting approval to use, disclose, or permit access to customers' CPNI.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Content of notice.</E> Customer notification shall provide sufficient information in clear and unambiguous language to enable the customer to make an informed decision as to whether to permit a TRS provider to use, disclose, or permit access to, the customer's CPNI.</P>

              <P>(1) The notification shall state that the customer has a right to deny any TRS provider the right to use, disclose or permit access to the customer's CPNI, and the TRS provider has a duty, <PRTPAGE P="482"/>under federal law, to honor the customer's right and to protect the confidentiality of CPNI.</P>
              <P>(2) The notification shall specify the types of information that constitute CPNI and the specific entities that will use, receive or have access to the CPNI, describe the purposes for which CPNI will be used, and inform the customer of his or her right to disapprove those uses, and deny or withdraw the customer's consent to use, disclose, or permit access to access to CPNI at any time.</P>
              <P>(3) The notification shall advise the customer of the precise steps the customer must take in order to grant or deny use, disclosure, or access to CPNI, and must clearly state that customer denial of approval will not affect the TRS provider's provision of any services to the customer. However, TRS providers may provide a brief statement, in clear and neutral language, describing consequences directly resulting from the lack of access to CPNI.</P>
              <P>(4) TRS providers shall provide the notification in a manner that is accessible to the customer, comprehensible, and not misleading.</P>
              <P>(5) If the TRS provider provides written notification to the customer, the notice shall be clearly legible, use sufficiently large type, and be placed in an area so as to be readily apparent to a customer.</P>
              <P>(6) If any portion of a notification is translated into another language, then all portions of the notification must be translated into that language.</P>
              <P>(7) A TRS provider may state in the notification that the customer's approval to use CPNI may enhance the TRS provider's ability to offer products and services tailored to the customer's needs. A TRS provider also may state in the notification that it may be compelled to disclose CPNI to any person upon affirmative written request by the customer.</P>
              <P>(8) The notification shall state that any approval or denial of approval for the use of CPNI outside of the service for which the TRS provider is the default provider for the customer is valid until the customer affirmatively revokes or limits such approval or denial.</P>
              <P>(9) A TRS provider's solicitation for approval to use, disclose, or have access to the customer's CPNI must be proximate to the notification of a customer's CPNI rights to non-disclosure.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice requirements specific to opt-out.</E> A TRS provider shall provide notification to obtain opt-out approval through electronic or written methods, but not by oral or sign language communication (except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section). The contents of any such notification shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) TRS providers shall wait a 30-day minimum period of time after giving customers notice and an opportunity to opt-out before assuming customer approval to use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI. A TRS provider may, in its discretion, provide for a longer period. TRS providers shall notify customers as to the applicable waiting period for a response before approval is assumed.</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of an electronic form of notification, the waiting period shall begin to run from the date on which the notification was sent; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of notification by mail, the waiting period shall begin to run on the third day following the date that the notification was mailed.</P>
              <P>(2) TRS providers using the opt-out mechanism shall provide notices to their customers every two years.</P>
              <P>(3) TRS providers that use email to provide opt-out notices shall comply with the following requirements in addition to the requirements generally applicable to notification:</P>
              <P>(i) TRS providers shall obtain express, verifiable, prior approval from consumers to send notices via email regarding their service in general, or CPNI in particular;</P>
              <P>(ii) TRS providers shall either:</P>
              <P>(A) Allow customers to reply directly to the email containing the CPNI notice in order to opt-out; or</P>

              <P>(B) Include within the email containing the CPNI notice a conspicuous link to a Web page that provides to the customer a readily usable opt-out mechanism;<PRTPAGE P="483"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Opt-out email notices that are returned to the TRS provider as undeliverable shall be sent to the customer in another form before the TRS provider may consider the customer to have received notice;</P>
              <P>(iv) TRS providers that use email to send CPNI notices shall ensure that the subject line of the message clearly and accurately identifies the subject matter of the email; and</P>
              <P>(v) TRS providers shall make available to every customer a method to opt-out that is of no additional cost to the customer and that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. TRS providers may satisfy this requirement through a combination of methods, so long as all customers have the ability to opt-out at no cost and are able to effectuate that choice whenever they choose.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice requirements specific to opt-in.</E> A TRS provider may provide notification to obtain opt-in approval through oral, sign language, written, or electronic methods. The contents of any such notification shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice requirements specific to one-time use of CPNI.</E> (1) TRS providers may use oral, text, or sign language notice to obtain limited, one-time use of CPNI for inbound and outbound customer telephone, TRS, or point-to-point contacts for the duration of the call, regardless of whether TRS providers use opt-out or opt-in approval based on the nature of the contact.</P>
              <P>(2) The contents of any such notification shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, except that TRS providers may omit any of the following notice provisions if not relevant to the limited use for which the TRS provider seeks CPNI:</P>
              <P>(i) TRS providers need not advise customers that if they have opted-out previously, no action is needed to maintain the opt-out election;</P>
              <P>(ii) TRS providers need not advise customers that the TRS provider may share CPNI with the TRS provider's affiliates or third parties and need not name those entities, if the limited CPNI usage will not result in use by, or disclosure to, an affiliate or third party;</P>
              <P>(iii) TRS providers need not disclose the means by which a customer can deny or withdraw future access to CPNI, so long as the TRS provider explains to customers that the scope of the approval the TRS provider seeks is limited to one-time use; and</P>
              <P>(iv) TRS providers may omit disclosure of the precise steps a customer must take in order to grant or deny access to CPNI, as long as the TRS provider clearly communicates that the customer can deny access to his or her CPNI for the call.</P>

              <P>(b) TRS providers shall train their personnel, including any agents, contractors, and subcontractors, as to when they are and are not authorized to use CPNI, including procedures for verification of the status of a customer's CPNI approval. TRS providers shall have an express disciplinary process in place, including in the case of agents, contractors, and subcontractors, a right to cancel the applicable contract(s) or otherwise take disciplinary action.</P>

              <P>(c) TRS providers shall maintain a record, electronically or in some other manner, of their own and their affiliates' sales and marketing campaigns that use their customers' CPNI. All TRS providers shall maintain a record of all instances where CPNI was disclosed or provided to third parties, or where third parties were allowed access to CPNI. The record shall include a description of each campaign, the specific CPNI that was used in the campaign, including the customer's name, and <PRTPAGE P="484"/>what products and services were offered as a part of the campaign. TRS providers shall retain the record for a minimum of three years.</P>
              <P>(d) TRS providers shall establish a supervisory review process regarding TRS provider compliance with the rules in this subpart for outbound marketing situations and maintain records of TRS provider compliance for a minimum period of three years. Sales personnel must obtain supervisory approval of any proposed outbound marketing request for customer approval.</P>
              <P>(e) A TRS provider shall have an officer, as an agent of the TRS provider, sign and file with the Commission a compliance certification on an annual basis. The officer shall state in the certification that he or she has personal knowledge that the company has established operating procedures that are adequate to ensure compliance with the rules in this subpart. The TRS provider must provide a statement accompanying the certification explaining how its operating procedures ensure that it is or is not in compliance with the rules in this subpart. In addition, the TRS provider must include an explanation of any actions taken against data brokers, a summary of all customer complaints received in the past year concerning the unauthorized release of CPNI, and a report detailing all instances where the TRS provider, or its agents, contractors, or subcontractors, used, disclosed, or permitted access to CPNI without complying with the procedures specified in this subpart. In the case of iTRS providers, this filing shall be included in the annual report filed with the Commission pursuant to § 64.606(g) of this part for data pertaining to the previous year. In the case of all other TRS providers, this filing shall be made annually with the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau on or before March 1 in CG Docket No. 03-123 for data pertaining to the previous calendar year.</P>
              <P>(f) TRS providers shall provide written notice within five business days to the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau of the Commission of any instance where the opt-out mechanisms do not work properly, to such a degree that consumers' inability to opt-out is more than an anomaly.</P>

If a customer cannot provide the correct password or the correct response for the back-up customer authentication method, the customer shall establish a new password as described in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification of account changes.</E> TRS providers shall notify customers immediately whenever a password, customer response to a back-up means of authentication for lost or forgotten passwords, online account, or address of record is created or changed. This notification is not required when the customer initiates service, including the selection of a password at service initiation. This notification may be through a TRS provider-originated voicemail, text message, or video mail to the telephone number of record, by mail to the physical address of record, or by email to the email address of record, and shall not reveal the changed information or be sent to the new account information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notification of customer proprietary network information security breaches.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A TRS provider shall notify law enforcement of a breach of its customers' CPNI as provided in this section. The TRS provider shall not notify its customers or disclose the breach publicly, whether voluntarily or under state or local law or these rules, until it has completed the process of notifying law enforcement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The TRS provider shall file a copy of the notification with the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau at the same time as when the TRS provider notifies the customers.</P>

              <P>(b) As soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven (7) business days, after reasonable determination of the breach, the TRS provider shall electronically notify the United States Secret Service (USSS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through a central reporting facility. The Commission will maintain a link to the reporting facility at <E T="03">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/cpni.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, the TRS provider shall not notify customers or disclose the breach to the public until 7 full business days have passed after notification to the USSS and the FBI except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the TRS provider believes that there is an extraordinarily urgent need to notify any class of affected customers sooner than otherwise allowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in order to avoid immediate and irreparable harm, it shall so indicate in its notification and may proceed to immediately notify its affected customers only after consultation with the relevant investigating agency. The TRS provider shall cooperate with the relevant investigating agency's request to minimize any adverse effects of such customer notification.</P>

              <P>(3) If the relevant investigating agency determines that public disclosure or notice to customers would impede or compromise an ongoing or potential criminal investigation or national security, such agency may direct the TRS provider not to so disclose or notify for an initial period of up to 30 days. Such period may be extended by the agency as reasonably necessary in the judgment of the agency. If such direction is given, the agency shall notify the TRS provider when it appears that public disclosure or notice to affected customers will no longer impede or compromise a criminal investigation or national security. The agency <PRTPAGE P="486"/>shall provide in writing its initial direction to the TRS provider, any subsequent extension, and any notification that notice will no longer impede or compromise a criminal investigation or national security and such writings shall be contemporaneously logged on the same reporting facility that contains records of notifications filed by TRS providers.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Customer notification.</E> After a TRS provider has completed the process of notifying law enforcement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and consistent with the waiting requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the TRS provider shall notify its customers of a breach of those customers' CPNI.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> All TRS providers shall maintain a record, electronically or in some other manner, of any breaches discovered, notifications made to the USSS and the FBI pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and notifications made to customers. The record must include, if available, dates of discovery and notification, a detailed description of the CPNI that was the subject of the breach, and the circumstances of the breach. TRS providers shall retain the record for a minimum of 2 years.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Definition.</E> As used in this section, a “breach” has occurred when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.</P>
              <P>(f) This section does not supersede any statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in any State, except to the extent that such statute, regulation, order, or interpretation is inconsistent with the provisions of this section, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certification to receive funding.</SUBJECT>

              <P>For each state, including the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, the Commission will certify a single program as the sole entity authorized to receive reimbursement for NDBEDP activities from the TRS Fund. Such entity will have full responsibility for <PRTPAGE P="491"/>distributing equipment and providing related services, such as outreach, assessments, installation, and training, in that state, either directly or through collaboration, partnership, or contract with other individuals or entities in-state or out-of-state, including other NDBEDP certified programs.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility for certification.</E> Public or private entities, including, but not limited to, equipment distribution programs, vocational rehabilitation programs, assistive technology programs, schools for the deaf, blind, or deaf-blind, organizational affiliates, independent living centers, or private educational facilities, may apply to the Commission for certification.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When to apply.</E> Applications for certification shall be filed:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 60 days after the effective date of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) At least one year prior to the expiration of a program's certification;</P>
              <P>(3) Within 30 days after public notice of a program's relinquishment of certification; and</P>
              <P>(4) If an application deadline is extended or a vacancy exists for other reasons than relinquishment or expiration of a certification, within the time period specified by public notice.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualifications.</E> Applications shall contain sufficient detail to demonstrate the entity's ability to meet all criteria required for certification and a commitment to comply with all Commission requirements governing the NDBEDP. The Commission shall review applications and determine whether to grant certification based on the ability of an entity to meet the following qualifications, either directly or in coordination with other programs or entities, as evidenced in the application and any supplemental materials, including letters of recommendation:</P>
              <P>(1) Expertise in the field of deaf-blindness, including familiarity with the culture and etiquette of individuals who are deaf-blind;</P>
              <P>(2) The ability to communicate effectively with individuals who are deaf-blind (for training and other purposes), by among other things, using sign language, providing materials in Braille, ensuring that information made available online is accessible, and using other assistive technologies and methods to achieve effective communication;</P>
              <P>(3) Administrative and financial management experience;</P>
              <P>(4) Staffing and facilities sufficient to administer the program, including the ability to distribute equipment and provide related services to low-income individuals who are deaf-blind throughout the state, including those in remote areas;</P>
              <P>(5) Experience with the distribution of specialized customer premises equipment, especially to individuals who are deaf-blind;</P>
              <P>(6) Experience in training consumers on how to use Equipment and how to set up Equipment for its effective use;</P>
              <P>(7) Familiarity with Covered Services; and,</P>
              <P>(8) If the applicant is seeking renewal of certification, ability to provide Equipment and related services in compliance with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (1) An applicant for certification shall disclose in its application any relationship, arrangement, or agreement with a manufacturer or provider of Equipment or related services that poses an actual or potential conflict of interest, as well as the steps the applicant will take to eliminate such actual or potential conflict or to minimize the associated risks. If an applicant learns of a potential or actual conflict while its application is pending, it must immediately disclose such conflict to the Commission. The Commission may reject an application for NDBEDP certification, or may require an applicant, as a condition of certification, to take additional steps to eliminate, or to minimize the risks associated with, an actual or potential conflict of interest, if relationships, arrangements, or agreements affecting the applicant are likely to impede its objectivity in the distribution of Equipment or its ability to comply with NDBEDP requirements.</P>

              <P>(2) A certified entity shall disclose to the Commission any relationship, arrangement, or agreement with a manufacturer or provider of Equipment or related services that comes into being or is discovered after certification is granted and that poses an actual or potential conflict of interest, as well as <PRTPAGE P="492"/>the steps the entity will take to eliminate such actual or potential conflict or to minimize the associated risks, within 30 days after the entity learns or should have learned of such actual or potential conflict of interest. The Commission may suspend or revoke an NDBEDP certification or may require a certified entity, as a condition of continued certification, to take additional steps to eliminate, or to minimize the risks associated with, an actual or potential conflict of interest, if relationships, arrangements, or agreements affecting the entity are likely to impede its objectivity in the distribution of Equipment or its ability to comply with NDBEDP requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification period.</E> Certification granted under this section shall be for a period of five years. A program may apply for renewal of its certification by filing a new application at least one year prior to the expiration of the certification period. If a certified entity is replaced prior to the expiration of the certification period, the successor entity's certification will expire on the date that the replaced entity's certification would have expired.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification of substantive change.</E> A certified program shall notify the Commission within 60 days of any substantive change that bears directly on its ability to meet the qualifications necessary for certification under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Relinquishment of certification.</E> A program wishing to relinquish its certification before its certification expires shall electronically provide written notice of its intent to do so to the NDBEDP Administrator and the TRS Fund Administrator at least 90 days in advance, explaining the reason for such relinquishment and providing its proposed departure date. After receiving such notice, the Commission shall take such steps as may be necessary, consistent with this subpart, to ensure continuity and effective oversight of the NDBEDP for the affected state.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Suspension or revocation of certification.</E> The Commission may suspend or revoke NDBEDP certification if, after notice and an opportunity to object, the Commission determines that an entity is no longer qualified for certification. Within 30 days after being notified of a proposed suspension or revocation of certification, the reason therefor, and the applicable suspension or revocation procedures, a certified entity may present written arguments and any relevant documentation as to why suspension or revocation of certification is not warranted. Failure to respond to a notice of suspension or revocation within 30 days may result in automatic suspension or revocation of certification. A suspension of certification will remain in effect until the expiration date, if any, or until the fulfillment of conditions stated in a suspension decision. A revocation will be effective for the remaining portion of the current certification period. In the event of suspension or revocation, the Commission shall take such steps as may be necessary, consistent with this subpart, to ensure continuity and effective oversight of the NDBEDP for the affected state.</P>

              <P>(j) <E T="03">Certification transitions.</E> When a new entity is certified as a state's program, the previously certified entity shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 30 days after the new entity is certified, and as a condition precedent to receiving payment for any reimbursement claims pending as of or after the date of certification of the successor entity,</P>
              <P>(i) Transfer to the new entity all NDBEDP data, records, and information for the previous five years, and any Equipment remaining in inventory;</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 64—Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System for National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Purpose and Authority</HD>
              <P>a. This appendix establishes policies and procedures and assigns responsibilities for the National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System. The NSEP TSP System authorizes priority treatment to certain domestic telecommunications services (including portions of U.S. international telecommunication services provided by U.S. service vendors) for which provisioning or restoration priority (RP) levels are requested, assigned, and approved in accordance with this appendix.</P>
              <P>b. This appendix is issued pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201 through 205 and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 154(i), 201 through 205 and 303(r). These sections grant to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the authority over the assignment and approval of priorities for provisioning and restoration of common carrier-provided telecommunications services. Under section 706 of the Communications Act, this authority may be superseded, and expanded to include non-common carrier telecommunication services, by the war emergency powers of the President of the United States. This appendix provides the Commission's Order to telecommunication service vendors and users to comply with policies and procedures establishing the NSEP TSP System, until such policies and procedures are superseded by the President's war emergency powers. This appendix is intended to be read in conjunction with regulations and procedures that the Executive Office of the President issues (1) to implement responsibilities assigned in section 6(b) of this appendix, or (2) for use in the event this appendix is superseded by the President's war emergency powers.</P>
              <P>c. Together, this appendix and the regulations and procedures issued by the Executive Office of the President establish one uniform system of priorities for provisioning and restoration of NSEP telecommunication services both before and after invocation of the President's war emergency powers. In order that government and industry resources may be used effectively under all conditions, a single set of rules, regulations, and procedures is necessary, and they must be applied on a day-to-day basis to all NSEP services so that the priorities they establish can be implemented at once when the need arises.</P>
              <P>* In sections 2(a)(2) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12472, “Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions” April 3, 1984 (49 FR 13471 (1984)), the President assigned to the Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, certain NSEP telecommunication resource management responsibilities. The term “Executive Office of the President” as used in this appendix refers to the official or organization designated by the President to act on his behalf.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Applicability and Revocation</HD>
              <P>a. This appendix applies to NSEP telecommunications services:</P>
              <P>(1) For which initial or revised priority level assignments are requested pursuant to section 8 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(2) Which were assigned restoration priorities under the provision of FCC Order 80-581; 81 FCC 2d 441 (1980); 47 CFR part 64, appendix A, “Priority System for the Restoration of Common Carrier Provided Intercity Private Line Services”; and are being resubmitted for priority level assignments pursuant to section 10 of this appendix. (Such services will retain assigned restoration priorities until a resubmission for a TSP assignment is completed or until the existing RP rules are terminated.)</P>
              <P>b. FCC Order 80-581 will continue to apply to all other intercity, private line circuits assigned restoration priorities thereunder until the fully operating capability date of this appendix, 30 months after the initial operating capability date referred to in subsection d of this section.</P>
              <P>c. In addition, FCC Order, “Precedence System for Public Correspondence Services Provided by the Communications Common Carriers” (34 FR 17292 (1969)); (47 CFR part 64, appendix B), is revoked as of the effective date of this appendix.</P>

              <P>d. The initial operating capability (IOC) date for NSEP TSP will be nine months after release in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the FCC's order following review of procedures submitted by the Executive Office of the President. On this IOC date requests for priority assignments generally will be accepted only by the Executive Office of the President.</P>

              <P>(1) Common carrier services which are:</P>
              <P>(a) Interstate or foreign telecommunications services,</P>

              <P>(b) Intrastate telecommunication services inseparable from interstate or foreign telecommunications services, and intrastate telecommunication services to which priority levels are assigned pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Initially, the NSEP TSP System's applicability to public switched services is limited to (a) provisioning of such services (e.g., business, centrex, cellular, foreign exchange, Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) and other services that the selected vendor is able to provision) and (b) restoration of services that the selected vendor is able to restore.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(2) Services which are provided by government and/or non-common carriers and are interconnected to common carrier services assigned a priority level pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Control services and orderwires.</E> The NSEP TSP System and procedures established by this appendix are not applicable to authorize priority treatment to control services or orderwires owned by a service vendor and needed for provisioning, restoration, or maintenance of other services owned by that service vendor. Such control services and orderwires shall have priority provisioning and restoration over all other telecommunication services (including NSEP services) and shall be exempt from preemption. However, the NSEP TSP System and procedures established by this appendix are applicable to control services or orderwires leased by a service vendor.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Other services.</E> The NSEP TSP System may apply, at the discretion of and upon special arrangements by the NSEP TSP System users involved, to authorize priority treatment to the following telecommunication services:</P>
              <P>(1) Government or non-common carrier services which are not connected to common carrier provided services assigned a priority level pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(2) Portions of U.S. international services which are provided by foreign correspondents. (U.S. telecommunication service vendors are encouraged to ensure that relevant operating arrangements are consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the NSEP TSP System. If such arrangements do not exist, U.S. telecommunication service vendors should handle service provisioning and/or restoration in accordance with any system acceptable to their foreign correspondents which comes closest to meeting the procedures established in this appendix.)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Policy</HD>

              <P>The NSEP TSP System is the regulatory, administrative, and operational system authorizing and providing for priority treatment, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> provisioning and restoration, of NSEP telecommunication services. As such, it establishes the framework for telecommunication service vendors to provision, restore, or otherwise act on a priority basis to ensure effective NSEP telecommunication services. The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of priority levels to any NSEP service across three time periods, or stress conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilizations, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/Recovery. Although priority levels normally will be assigned by the Executive Office of the President and retained by service vendors only for the current time period, they may be preassigned for the other two time periods at the request of service users who are able to identify and justify in advance, their wartime or post-attack NSEP telecommunication requirements. Absent such preassigned priority levels for the Attack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery periods, priority level assignments for the Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization period will remain in effect. At all times, priority level assignments will be subject to revision by the FCC or (on an interim basis) the Executive Office of the President, based upon changing NSEP needs. No other system of telecommunication service priorities which conflicts with the NSEP TSP System is authorized.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Responsibilities</HD>

              <P>(11) Comply with any regulations and procedures supplemental to and consistent with this appendix that are issued by the Executive Office of the President.</P>
              <P>e. Non-federal service users, in addition to responsibilities prescribed above in section 6(d), will obtain a sponsoring Federal organization for all requests for priority actions. If unable to find a sponsoring Federal organization, a non-federal service user may submit its request, which must include documentation of attempts made to obtain a sponsor and reasons given by the sponsor for its refusal, directly to the Executive Office of the President.</P>
              <P>f. Service vendors will:</P>
              <P>(1) When NSEP treatment is invoked by service users, provision NSEP telecommunication services before non-NSEP services, based on priority level assignments made by the Executive Office of the President. Provisioning will require service vendors to:</P>
              <P>(a) Allocate resources to ensure best efforts to provide NSEP services by the time required. When limited resources constrain response capability, vendors will address conflicts for resources by:</P>

              <P>(i) Providing NSEP services in order of provisioning priority level assignment (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, “E”, “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, or “5”);</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. Preemption of Existing Services</HD>
              <P>When necessary to provision or restore NSEP services, service vendors may preempt services they provide as specified below. “User” as used in this Section means any user of a telecommunications service, including both NSEP and non-NSEP services. Prior consent by a preempted user is not required.</P>
              <P>a. The sequence in which existing services may be preempted to provision NSEP services assigned a provisioning priority level “E” or restore NSEP services assigned a restoration priority level from “1” through “5”:</P>
              <P>(1) Non-NSEP services: If suitable spare services are not available, then, based on the considerations in this appendix and the service vendor's best judgment, non-NSEP services will be preempted. After ensuring a sufficient number of public switched services are available for public use, based on the service vendor's best judgment, such services may be used to satisfy a requirement for provisioning or restoring NSEP services.</P>

              <P>(2) NSEP services: If no suitable spare or non-NSEP services are available, then existing NSEP services may be preempted to provision or restore NSEP services with higher <PRTPAGE P="503"/>priority level assignments. When this is necessary, NSEP services will be selected for preemption in the inverse order of priority level assignment.</P>
              <P>(3) Service vendors who are preempting services will ensure their best effort to notify the service user of the preempted service and state the reason for and estimated duration of the preemption.</P>
              <P>b. Service vendors may, based on their best judgment, determine the sequence in which existing services may be preempted to provision NSEP services assigned a provisioning priority of “1” through “5”. Preemption is not subject to the consent of the user whose service will be preempted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. Requests for Priority Assignments.</HD>
              <P>All service users are required to submit requests for priority actions through the Executive Office of the President in the format and following the procedures prescribed by that Office.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9. Assignment, Approval, Use, and Invocation of Priority Levels</HD>
              <P>a. <E T="03">Assignment and approval of priority levels.</E> Priority level assignments will be based upon the categories and criteria specified in section 12 of this appendix. A priority level assignment made by the Executive Office of the President will serve as that Office's recommendation to the FCC. Until the President's war emergency powers are invoked, priority level assignments must be approved by the FCC. However, service vendors are ordered to implement any priority level assignments that are pending FCC approval.</P>
              <P>After invocation of the President's war emergency powers, these requirements may be superseded by other procedures issued by the Executive Office of the President.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Use of Priority Level Assignments.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) All provisioning and restoration priority level assignments for services in the Emergency NSEP category will be included in initial service orders to vendors. Provisioning priority level assignments for Essential NSEP services, however, will not usually be included in initial service orders to vendors. NSEP treatment for Essential NSEP services will be invoked and provisioning priority level assignments will be conveyed to service vendors only if the vendors cannot meet needed service dates through the normal provisioning process.</P>
              <P>(2) Any revision or revocation of either provisioning or restoration priority level assignments will also be transmitted to vendors.</P>

              <P>(3) Service vendors shall accept priority levels and/or revisions only after assignment by the Executive Office of the President.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

                <P>Service vendors acting as prime contractors will accept assigned NSEP priority levels only when they are accompanied by the Executive Office of the President designated service identification, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> TSP Authorization Code. However, service vendors are authorized to accept priority levels and/or revisions from users and contracting activities before assignment by the Executive Office of the President when service vendor, user, and contracting activities are unable to communicate with either the Executive Office of the President or the FCC. Processing of Emergency NSEP service requests will not be delayed for verification purposes.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>c. <E T="03">Invocation of NSEP treatment.</E> To invoke NSEP treatment for the priority provisioning of an NSEP telecommunications service, an authorized Federal official either within, or acting on behalf of, the service user's organization must make a written or oral declaration to concerned service vendor(s) and the Executive Office of the President that NSEP treatment is being invoked. Authorized Federal officials include the head or director of a Federal agency, commander of a unified/specified military command, chief of a military service, or commander of a major military command; the delegates of any of the foregoing; or any other officials as specified in supplemental regulations or procedures issued by the Executive Office of the President. The authority to invoke NSEP treatment may be delegated only to a general or flag officer of a military service, civilian employee of equivalent grade (e.g., Senior Executive Service member), Federal Coordinating Officer or Federal Emergency Communications Coordinator/Manager, or any other such officials specified in supplemental regulations or procedures issued by the Executive Office of the President. Delegates must be designated as such in writing, and written or oral invocations must be accomplished, in accordance with supplemental regulations or procedures issued by the Executive Office of the President.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">10. Resubmission of Circuits Presently Assigned Restoration Priorities</HD>
              <P>All circuits assigned restoration priorities must be reviewed for eligibility for initial restoration priority level assignment under the provisions of this appendix. Circuits currently assigned restoration priorities, and for which restoration priority level assignments are requested under section 8 of this appendix, will be resubmitted to the Executive Office of the President. To resubmit such circuits, service users will comply with applicable provisions of section 6(d) of this appendix.</P>

              <P>Service users or sponsoring Federal organizations may appeal any priority level assignment, denial, revision, revocation, approval, or disapproval to the Executive Office of the President within 30 days of notification to <PRTPAGE P="504"/>the service user. The appellant must use the form or format required by the Executive Office of the President and must serve the FCC with a copy of its appeal. The Executive Office of the President will act on the appeal within 90 days of receipt. Service users and sponsoring Federal organizations may only then appeal directly to the FCC. Such FCC appeal must be filed within 30 days of notification of the Executive Office of the President's decision on appeal. Additionally, the Executive Office of the President may appeal any FCC revisions, approvals, or disapprovals to the FCC. All appeals to the FCC must be submitted using the form or format required. The party filing its appeal with the FCC must include factual details supporting its claim and must serve a copy on the Executive Office of the President and any other party directly involved. Such party may file a response within 20 days, and replies may be filed within 10 days thereafter. The Commission will not issue public notices of such submissions. The Commission will provide notice of its decision to the parties of record. Any appeals to the Executive Office of the President that include a claim of new information that has not been presented before for consideration may be submitted at any time.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">12. NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and Priority Levels</HD>
              <P>a. <E T="03">General.</E> NSEP TSP System categories and criteria, and permissible priority level assignments, are defined and explained below.</P>
              <P>(1) The Essential NSEP category has four subcategories: National Security Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law and Order; and Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic Posture. Each subcategory has its own criteria. Criteria are also shown for the Emergency NSEP category, which has no sub-categories.</P>
              <P>(2) Priority levels of “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” and “5” may be assigned for provisioning and/or restoration of Essential NSEP telecommunication services. However, for Emergency NSEP telecommunications services, a priority level “E” is assigned for provisioning. A restoration priority level from “1” through “5” may be assigned if an Emergency NSEP service also qualifies for such a restoration priority level under the Essential NSEP category.</P>
              <P>(3) The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of priority levels to any NSEP telecommunications service across three time periods, or stress conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/Recovery. Priority levels will normally be assigned only for the first time period. These assigned priority levels will apply through the onset of any attack, but it is expected that they would later be revised by surviving authorized telecommunication resource managers within the Executive Office of the President based upon specific facts and circumstances arising during the Attack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery time periods.</P>
              <P>(4) Service users may, for their own internal use, assign subpriorities to their services assigned priority levels. Receipt of and response to any such subpriorities is optional for service vendors.</P>
              <P>(5) The following paragraphs provide a detailed explanation of the categories, subcategories, criteria, and priority level assignments, beginning with the Emergency NSEP category.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Emergency NSEP.</E> Telecommunications services in the Emergency NSEP category are those new services so critical as to be required to be provisioned at the earliest possible time, without regard to the costs of obtaining them.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> To qualify under the Emergency NSEP category, the service must meet criteria directly supporting or resulting from at least one of the following NSEP functions:</P>
              <P>(a) Federal government activity responding to a Presidentially declared disaster or emergency as defined in the Disaster Relief Act (42 U.S.C. 5122).</P>
              <P>(b) State or local government activity responding to a Presidentially declared disaster or emergency.</P>
              <P>(c) Response to a state of crisis declared by the National Command Authorities (e.g., exercise of Presidential war emergency powers under section 706 of the Communications Act.)</P>
              <P>(d) Efforts to protect endangered U.S. personnel or property.</P>
              <P>(e) Response to an enemy or terrorist action, civil disturbance, natural disaster, or any other unpredictable occurrence that has damaged facilities whose uninterrupted operation is critical to NSEP or the management of other ongoing crises.</P>
              <P>(f) Certification by the head or director of a Federal agency, commander of a unified/specified command, chief of a military service, or commander of a major military command, that the telecommunications service is so critical to protection of life and property or to NSEP that it must be provided immediately.</P>

              <P>(g) A request from an official authorized pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and 18 U.S.C. 2511, 2518, 2519).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Priority Level Assignment.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(a) Services qualifying under the Emergency NSEP category are assigned priority level “E” for provisioning.</P>

              <P>(b) After 30 days, assignments of provisioning priority level “E” for Emergency NSEP services are automatically revoked unless extended for another 30-day period. A <PRTPAGE P="505"/>notice of any such revocation will be sent to service vendors.</P>
              <P>(c) For restoration, Emergency NSEP services may be assigned priority levels under the provisions applicable to Essential NSEP services (see section 12(c)). Emergency NSEP services not otherwise qualifying for restoration priority level assignment as Essential NSEP may be assigned a restoration priority level “5” for a 30-day period. Such 30-day restoration priority level assignments will be revoked automatically unless extended for another 30-day period. A notice of any such revocation will be sent to service vendors.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Essential NSEP.</E> Telecommunication services in the Essential NSEP category are those required to be provisioned by due dates specified by service users, or restored promptly, normally without regard to associated overtime or expediting costs. They may be assigned priority level of “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” or “5” for both provisioning and restoration, depending upon the nature and urgency of the supported function, the impact of lack of service or of service interruption upon the supported function, and, for priority access to public switched services, the user's level of responsibility. Priority level assignments will be valid for no more than three years unless revalidated. To be categorized as Essential NSEP, a telecommunications service must qualify under one of the four following subcategories: National Security Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack Warning; Public Health, Safety and Maintenance of Law and Order; or Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic Posture. (<E T="04">Note</E> Under emergency circumstances, Essential NSEP telecommunication services may be recategorized as Emergency NSEP and assigned a priority level “E” for provisioning.)</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">National security leadership.</E> This subcategory will be strictly limited to only those telecommunication services essential to national survival if nuclear attack threatens or occurs, and critical orderwire and control services necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient provisioning or restoration of other NSEP telecommunication services. Services in this subcategory are those for which a service interruption of even a few minutes would have serious adverse impact upon the supported NSEP function.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> To qualify under this subcategory, a service must be at least one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Critical orderwire, or control service, supporting other NSEP functions.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 64—Priority Access Service (PAS) for National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. Authority</HD>
              <P>This appendix is issued pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201 through 205 and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Under these sections, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may permit the assignment and approval of priorities for access to commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) networks. Under section 706 of the Communications Act, this authority may be superseded by the war emergency powers of the President of the United States. This appendix provides the Commission's Order to CMRS providers and users to comply with policies and procedures establishing the Priority Access Service (PAS). This appendix is intended to be read in conjunction with regulations and procedures that the Executive Office of the President issues:</P>
              <P>(1) To implement responsibilities assigned in section 3 of this appendix, or</P>
              <P>(2) For use in the event this appendix is superseded by the President's emergency war powers. Together, this appendix and the regulations and procedures issued by the Executive Office of the President establish one uniform system of priority access service both before and after invocation of the President's emergency war powers.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Background</HD>
              <P>a. Purpose. This appendix establishes regulatory authorization for PAS to support the needs of NSEP CMRS users.</P>
              <P>b. Applicability. This appendix applies to the provision of PAS by CMRS licensees to users who qualify under the provisions of section 5 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>c. Description. PAS provides the means for NSEP telecommunications users to obtain priority access to available radio channels when necessary to initiate emergency calls. It does not preempt calls in progress and is to be used during situations when CMRS network congestion is blocking NSEP call attempts. PAS is to be available to authorized NSEP users at all times in equipped CMRS <PRTPAGE P="507"/>markets where the service provider has voluntarily decided to provide such service. Authorized users would activate the feature on a per call basis by dialing a feature code such as *XX. PAS priorities 1 through 5 are reserved for qualified and authorized NSEP users, and those users are provided access to CMRS channels before any other CMRS callers.</P>
              <P>d. Definitions. As used in this appendix:</P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Authorizing agent</E> refers to a Federal or State entity that authenticates, evaluates and makes recommendations to the Executive Office of the President regarding the assignment of priority access service levels.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Service provider</E> means an FCC-licensed CMRS provider. The term does not include agents of the licensed CMRS provider or resellers of CMRS service.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Service user</E> means an individual or organization (including a service provider) to whom or which a priority access assignment has been made.</P>
              <P>4. The following terms have the same meaning as in Appendix A to Part 64:</P>
              <P>(a) Assignment;</P>
              <P>(b) Government;</P>
              <P>(c) National Communications System;</P>
              <P>(d) National Coordinating Center;</P>
              <P>(e) National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) Telecommunications Services (excluding the last sentence);</P>
              <P>(f) Reconciliation;</P>
              <P>(g) Revalidation;</P>
              <P>(h) Revision;</P>
              <P>(i) Revocation.</P>
              <P>e. Administration. The Executive Office of the President will administer PAS.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Responsibilities</HD>
              <P>a. The <E T="03">Federal Communications Commission</E> will provide regulatory oversight of the implementation of PAS, enforce PAS rules and regulations, and act as final authority for approval, revision, or disapproval of priority assignments by the Executive Office of the President by adjudicating disputes regarding either priority assignments or the denial thereof by the Executive Office of the President until superseded by the President's war emergency powers under Section 706 of the Communications Act.</P>
              <P>b. The <E T="03">Executive Office of the President (EOP)</E> will administer the PAS system. It will:</P>
              <P>1. Act as the final approval or denial authority for the assignment of priorities and the adjudicator of disputes during the exercise of the President's war emergency powers under section 706 of the Communications Act.</P>
              <P>2. Receive, process, and evaluate requests for priority actions from authorizing agents on behalf of service users or directly from service users. Assign priorities or deny requests for priority using the priorities and criteria specified in section 5 of this appendix. Actions on such requests should be completed within 30 days of receipt.</P>
              <P>3. Convey priority assignments to the service provider and the authorizing agent.</P>
              <P>4. Revise, revalidate, reconcile, and revoke priority level assignments with service users and service providers as necessary to maintain the viability of the PAS system.</P>
              <P>5. Maintain a database for PAS related information.</P>
              <P>6. Issue new or revised regulations, procedures, and instructional material supplemental to and consistent with this appendix regarding the operation, administration, and use of PAS.</P>
              <P>7. Provide training on PAS to affected entities and individuals.</P>
              <P>8. Enlarge the role of the Telecommunications Service Priority System Oversight Committee to include oversight of the PAS system.</P>
              <P>9. Report periodically to the FCC on the status of PAS.</P>
              <P>10. Disclose content of the NSEP PAS database only as may be required by law.</P>
              <P>c. An <E T="03">Authorizing agent</E> shall:</P>
              <P>1. Identify itself as an authorizing agent and its community of interest (State, Federal Agency) to the EOP. State Authorizing Agents will provide a central point of contact to receive priority requests from users within their state. Federal Authorizing Agents will provide a central point of contact to receive priority requests from federal users or federally sponsored entities.</P>
              <P>2. Authenticate, evaluate, and make recommendations to the EOP to approve priority level assignment requests using the priorities and criteria specified in section 5 of this appendix. As a guide, PAS authorizing agents should request the lowest priority level that is applicable and the minimum number of CMRS services required to support an NSEP function. When appropriate, the authorizing agent will recommend approval or deny requests for PAS.</P>
              <P>3. Ensure that documentation is complete and accurate before forwarding it to the EOP.</P>
              <P>4. Serve as a conduit for forwarding PAS information from the EOP to the service user and vice versa. Information will include PAS requests and assignments, reconciliation and revalidation notifications, and other information.</P>
              <P>5. Participate in reconciliation and revalidation of PAS information at the request of the EOP.</P>
              <P>6. Comply with any regulations and procedures supplemental to and consistent with this appendix that are issued by the EOP.</P>
              <P>7. Disclose content of the NSEP PAS database only to those having a need-to-know.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Service users</E> will:</P>

              <P>1. Determine the need for and request PAS assignments in a planned process, not waiting until an emergency has occurred.<PRTPAGE P="508"/>
              </P>
              <P>2. Request PAS assignments for the lowest applicable priority level and minimum number of CMRS services necessary to provide NSEP telecommunications management and response functions during emergency/disaster situations.</P>
              <P>3. Initiate PAS requests through the appropriate authorizing agent. The EOP will make final approval or denial of PAS requests and may direct service providers to remove PAS if appropriate. (Note: State and local government or private users will apply for PAS through their designated State government authorizing agent. Federal users will apply for PAS through their employing agency. State and local users in states where there has been no designation will be sponsored by the Federal agency concerned with the emergency function as set forth in Executive Order 12656. If no authorizing agent is determined using these criteria, the EOP will serve as the authorizing agent.)</P>
              <P>4. Submit all correspondence regarding PAS to the authorizing agent.</P>
              <P>5. Invoke PAS only when CMRS congestion blocks network access and the user must establish communications to fulfill an NSEP mission. Calls should be as brief as possible so as to afford CMRS service to other NSEP users.</P>
              <P>6. Participate in reconciliation and revalidation of PAS information at the request of the authorizing agent or the EOP.</P>
              <P>7. Request discontinuance of PAS when the NSEP qualifying criteria used to obtain PAS is no longer applicable.</P>
              <P>8. Pay service providers as billed for PAS.</P>
              <P>9. Comply with regulations and procedures that are issued by the EOP which are supplemental to and consistent with this appendix.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Service providers</E> who offer any form of priority access service for NSEP purposes shall provide that service in accordance with this appendix. As currently described in the Priority Access and Channel Assignment Standard (IS-53-A), service providers will:</P>
              <P>1. Provide PAS levels 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 only upon receipt of an authorization from the EOP and remove PAS for specific users at the direction of the EOP.</P>
              <P>2. Ensure that PAS system priorities supersede any other NSEP priority which may be provided.</P>
              <P>3. Designate a point of contact to coordinate with the EOP regarding PAS.</P>
              <P>4. Participate in reconciliation and revalidation of PAS information at the request of the EOP.</P>
              <P>5. As technically and economically feasible, provide roaming service users the same grade of PAS provided to local service users.</P>
              <P>6. Disclose content of the NSEP PAS database only to those having a need-to-know or who will not use the information for economic advantage.</P>
              <P>7. Comply with regulations and procedures supplemental to and consistent with this appendix that are issued by the EOP.</P>
              <P>8. Insure that at all times a reasonable amount of CMRS spectrum is made available for public use.</P>
              <P>9. Notify the EOP and the service user if PAS is to be discontinued as a service.</P>
              <P>f. The <E T="03">Telecommunications Service Priority Oversight Committee</E> will identify and review any systemic problems associated with the PAS system and recommend actions to correct them or prevent their recurrence.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Appeal</HD>
              <P>Service users and authorizing agents may appeal any priority level assignment, denial, revision or revocation to the EOP within 30 days of notification to the service user. The EOP will act on the appeal within 90 days of receipt. If a dispute still exists, an appeal may then be made to the FCC within 30 days of notification of the EOP's decision. The party filing the appeal must include factual details supporting its claim and must provide a copy of the appeal to the EOP and any other party directly involved. Involved parties may file a response to the appeal made to the FCC within 20 days, and the initial filing party may file a reply within 10 days thereafter. The FCC will provide notice of its decision to the parties of record. Until a decision is made, the service will remain status quo.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">5. PAS Priority Levels and Qualifying Criteria</HD>
              <P>The following PAS priority levels and qualifying criteria apply equally to all users and will be used as a basis for all PAS assignments. There are five levels of NSEP priorities, priority one being the highest. The five priority levels are:</P>
              <P>1. Executive Leadership and Policy Makers</P>
              <P>2. Disaster Response/Military Command and Control</P>
              <P>3. Public Health, Safety and Law Enforcement Command</P>
              <P>4. Public Services/Utilities and Public Welfare</P>
              <P>5. Disaster Recovery</P>

              <P>These priority levels were selected to meet the needs of the emergency response community and provide priority access for the command and control functions critical to management of and response to national security and emergency situations, particularly during the first 24 to 72 hours following an event. Priority assignments should only be requested for key personnel and those individuals in national security and emergency response leadership positions. PAS is not intended for use by all emergency service personnel.<PRTPAGE P="509"/>

              <P>(a) Exclusion from unitary treatment will be granted for a period of two years if the cost of capital for interstate exchange service is so low as to be confiscatory because it is outside the zone of reasonableness for the individual carrier's required rate of return for interstate exchange access services.</P>
              <P>(b) A petition for exclusion from unitary treatment and for individual treatment must plead with particularity the exceptional facts and circumstances that justify individual treatment. The showing shall include a demonstration that the exceptional facts and circumstances are not of transitory effect, such that exclusion for a period of a least two years is justified.</P>
              <P>(c) A petition for exclusion from unitary treatment and for individual treatment may be filed at any time. When a petition is filed at a time other than that specified in § 65.103(b)(2), the petitioner must provide compelling evidence that its need for individual treatment is not simply the result of short-term fluctuations in the cost of capital or similar events.</P>

              <P>(a) Sections 65.301 through 65.303 specify the calculations that are to be performed in computing cost of debt, cost of preferred stock, and financial structure weights for prescription proceedings. The calculations shall determine, where applicable, a composite cost of debt, a composite cost of preferred stock, and a composite financial structure for all local exchange carriers with annual revenues equal to or above the indexed revenue threshold as defined in § 32.9000. The calculations shall be based on data reported to the Commission in FCC Report 43-02. (See 47 CFR 43.21). The results of the calculations shall be used in the represcription proceeding to which they relate unless the record in that proceeding shows that their use would be unreasonable.</P>
              <P>(b) Excluded from cost of capital calculations made pursuant to § 65.300 shall be those sources of financing that are not investor supplied, or that are otherwise subtracted from a carrier's rate base pursuant to Commission orders governing the calculation of net rate base amounts in tariff filings that are made pursuant to section 203 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 203, or that were treated as “zero cost” sources of financing in section 450 and subpart G of this part 65. Specifically excluded are: accounts payable, accrued taxes, accrued interest, dividends payable, deferred credits and operating reserves, deferred taxes and deferred tax credits.</P>

              <P>(a) For exchange carriers, earnings shall be measured separately for each access service category for purposes of determining compliance with the maximum allowable rate of return. The access service categories shall be: an aggregated category consisting of Special Access, § 69.113, and Contribution Charges for Special Access Expanded Interconnection, § 69.122; Connection Charges for Expanded Interconnection, § 69.121; Common Line, §§ 69.104-69.105; and an aggregated category consisting of Line Termination, § 69.106, Intercept, <PRTPAGE P="517"/>§ 69.108, Local Switching, § 69.107, Transport, §§ 69.110-69.112, 69.124, 69.125, and Information, § 69.109. The Billing and Collection access element shall not be included in any access service category for purposes of this part. The Commission will also separately review exchange carrier overall interstate earnings subject to this part for determining compliance with the maximum allowable rate of return determined by § 65.700(b).</P>
              <P>(b) For exchange carriers, earnings shall be measured for purposes of determining compliance with the maximum allowable rates of return separately for each study area; provided, however, that if the carrier has filed or concurred in access tariffs aggregating costs and rates for two or more study areas, the earnings will be determined for the aggregated study areas rather than for each study area separately. If an exchange carrier has not utilized the same level of study area aggregation during the entire two-year earnings review period, then the carrier's earnings will be measured for the entire two-year period on the basis of the tariffs in effect at the end of the second year of the two-year review period; provided, however, that if tariffs representing a higher level of study area aggregation were not in effect for at least eight months in the second year, then the carrier's earnings will be measured on the basis of the study area level of aggregation in effect for the majority of the two-year period; provided further, that any carrier that was not a member of the National Exchange Carrier Association or other voluntary pools for both years of the two-year review period will have its earnings reviewed individually for the full two-year period.</P>

Except as noted above, no amounts from accounts 1406 through 1500 shall be included.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Cash working capital.</E> The average amount of investor-supplied capital needed to provide funds for a carrier's day-to-day interstate operations. Carriers may calculate a cash working <PRTPAGE P="518"/>capital allowance either by performing a lead-lag study of interstate revenue and expense items or by using the formula set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Carriers, in lieu of performing a lead-lag study or using the formula in paragraph (e) of this section, may calculate the cash working capital allowance using a standard allowance which will be established annually by the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau. When either the lead-lag study or formula method is used to calculate cash working capital, the amount calculated under the study or formula may be increased by minimum bank balances and working cash advances to determine the cash working capital allowance. Once a carrier has selected a method of determining its cash working capital allowance, it shall not change to an optional method from one year to the next without Commission approval.</P>
              <P>(e) In lieu of a full lead-lag study, carriers may calculate the cash working capital allowance using the following formula.</P>
              <P>(1) Compute the weighted average revenue lag days as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Multiply the average revenue lag days for interstate revenues billed in arrears by the percentage of interstate revenues billed in arrears.</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiply the average revenue lag days for interstate revenues billed in advance by the percentage of interstate revenues billed in advance. (Note: a revenue lead should be shown as a negative lag.)</P>
              <P>(iii) Add the results of paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section to determine the weighted average revenue lag days.</P>
              <P>(2) Compute the weighted average expense lag days as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) Multiply the average lag days for interstate expenses (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, cash operating expenses plus interest) paid in arrears by the percentage of interstate expenses paid in arrears.</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiply the average lag days for interstate expenses paid in advance by the percentage of interstate expenses paid in advance. (Note: an expense lead should be shown as a negative lag.)</P>
              <P>(iii) Add the results of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section to determine the weighted average expense lag days.</P>
              <P>(3) Compute the weighted net lag days by deducting the weighted average expense lag days from the weighted average revenue lag days.</P>
              <P>(4) Compute the percentage of a year represented by the weighted net lag days by dividing the days computed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section by 365 days.</P>

              <P>(5) Compute the cash working capital allowance by multiplying the interstate cash operating expenses (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, operating expenses minus depreciation and amortization) plus interest by the percentage computed in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Minimum point of entry (MPOE) and demarcation point.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Facilities at the demarcation point.</E> Carrier-installed facilities at, or constituting, the demarcation point shall consist of wire or a jack conforming to the technical criteria published by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimum point of entry.</E> The “minimum point of entry” (MPOE) as used herein shall be either the closest practicable point to where the wiring crosses a property line or the closest practicable point to where the wiring enters a multiunit building or buildings. The reasonable and nondiscriminatory standard operating practices of the provider of wireline telecommunications services shall determine which shall apply. The provider of wireline telecommunications services is not precluded from establishing reasonable classifications of multiunit premises for purposes of determining which shall apply. Multiunit premises include, but are not limited to, residential, commercial, shopping center and campus situations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Single unit installations.</E> For single unit installations existing as of August 13, 1990, and installations installed after that date the demarcation point shall be a point within 30 cm (12 in) of the protector or, where there is no protector, within 30 cm (12 in) of where the telephone wire enters the customer's premises, or as close thereto as practicable.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Multiunit installations.</E> (1) In multiunit premises existing as of August 13, 1990, the demarcation point shall be determined in accordance with the local carrier's reasonable and non-discriminatory standard operating practices. Provided, however, that where there are multiple demarcation points within the multiunit premises, a demarcation point for a customer shall not be further inside the customer's premises than a point twelve inches from where the wiring enters the customer's premises, or as close thereto as practicable.</P>

              <P>(2) In multiunit premises in which wiring is installed, including major additions or rearrangements of wiring existing prior to that date, the provider of wireline telecommunications may place the demarcation point at the minimum point of entry (MPOE). If the provider of wireline telecommunications services does not elect to establish a practice of placing the demarcation point at the minimum point of entry, the multiunit premises owner shall determine the location of the demarcation point or points. The multiunit premises owner shall determine <PRTPAGE P="525"/>whether there shall be a single demarcation point location for all customers or separate such locations for each customer. Provided, however, that where there are multiple demarcation points within the multiunit premises, a demarcation point for a customer shall not be further inside the customer's premises than a point 30 cm (12 in) from where the wiring enters the customer's premises, or as close thereto as practicable. At the time of installation, the provider of wireline telecommunications services shall fully inform the premises owner of its options and rights regarding the placement of the demarcation point or points and shall not attempt to unduly influence that decision for the purpose of obstructing competitive entry.</P>

              <P>(3) In any multiunit premises where the demarcation point is not already at the MPOE, the provider of wireline telecommunications services must comply with a request from the premises owner to relocate the demarcation point to the MPOE. The provider of wireline telecommunications services must negotiate terms in good faith and complete the negotiations within forty-five days from said request. Premises owners may file complaints with the Commission for resolution of allegations of bad faith bargaining by provider of wireline telecommunications services. <E T="03">See</E> 47 U.S.C. 208, 47 CFR 1.720 through 1.740.</P>
              <P>(4) The provider of wireline telecommunications services shall make available information on the location of the demarcation point within ten business days of a request from the premises owner. If the provider of wireline telecommunications services does not provide the information within that time, the premises owner may presume the demarcation point to be at the MPOE. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 68.110(b), provider of wireline telecommunications services must make this information freely available to the requesting premises owner.</P>
              <P>(5) In multiunit premises with more than one customer, the premises owner may adopt a policy restricting a customer's access to wiring on the premises to only that wiring located in the customer's individual unit that serves only that particular customer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Installation of other than “fully protected” non-system simple customer premises wiring.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of this rule.</E> Provisions of this rule apply only to “unprotected” premises wiring used with simple installations of wiring for up to four line residential and business telephone service. More complex installations of wiring for multiple line services, for use with systems such as PBX and key telephone systems, are controlled by § 68.215 of these rules.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Wiring authorized.</E> Unprotected premises wiring may be used to connect units of terminal equipment or protective circuitry to one another, and to carrier-installed facilities if installed in accordance with these rules. The provider of wireline telecommunications is not responsible, except pursuant to agreement between it and the customer or undertakings by it, otherwise consistent with Commission requirements, for installation and maintenance of wiring on the subscriber's side of the demarcation point, including any wire or jacks that may have been installed by the carrier. The subscriber and/or premises owner may install wiring on the subscriber's side of the demarcation point, and may remove, reconfigure, and rearrange wiring on that side of the demarcation point including wiring and wiring that may have been installed by the carrier. The customer or premises owner may not access carrier wiring and facilities on the carrier's side of the demarcation point. Customers may not access the protector installed by the provider of wireline telecommunications. All plugs and jacks used in connection with inside wiring shall conform to the published technical criteria of the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments. In multiunit premises with more than one customer, the premises owner may adopt a policy restricting a customer's access to wiring on the premises to only that wiring located in the customer's individual unit wiring that serves only that particular customer. See § 68.105 in this part. The customer or premises owner may not access carrier wiring and facilities on the carrier's side of the demarcation point. Customers may not access the protector installed by the provider of <PRTPAGE P="534"/>wireline telecommunications. All plugs and jacks used in connection with inside wiring shall conform to the published technical criteria of the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments.</P>
              <P>(c) Material requirements. (1) For new installations and modifications to existing installations, copper conductors shall be, at a minimum, solid, 24 gauge or larger, twisted pairs that comply with the electrical specifications for Category 3, as defined in the ANSI EIA/TIA Building Wiring Standards.</P>
              <P>(2) Conductors shall have insulation with a 1500 Volt rms minimum breakdown rating. This rating shall be established by covering the jacket or sheath with at least 15 cm (6 inches) (measured linearly on the cable) of conductive foil, and establishing a potential difference between the foil and all of the individual conductors connected together, such potential difference gradually increased over a 30 second time period to 1500 Volts rms, 60 Hertz, then applied continuously for one minute. At no time during this 90 second time interval shall the current between these points exceed 10 milliamperes peak.</P>
              <P>(3) All wire and connectors meeting the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) shall be marked, in a manner visible to the consumer, with the symbol “CAT 3” or a symbol consisting of a “C” with a “3” contained within the “C” character, at intervals not to exceed one foot (12 inches) along the length of the wire.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Attestation.</E> Manufacturers (or distributors or retailers, whichever name appears on the packaging) of non-system telephone premises wire shall attest in a letter to the Commission that the wire conforms with part 68, FCC Rules.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Between an equipment entity and the public switched telephone network interface(s).</E> Fully-protected premises wiring shall be used to connect equipment entities to the public switched telephone network interface unless the provider of wireline telecommunications is unwilling or unable to locate the interface within 7.6 meters (25 feet) of the equipment entity on reasonable request. In any such case, other than fully-protected premises wiring may be used if otherwise in accordance with these rules.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Hardware protection as part of the facilities of the provider of wireline telecommunications.</E> In any case where the carrier chooses to provide (and the customer chooses to accept, except as authorized under paragraph (g) of this section), hardware protection on the network side of the interface(s), the presence of such hardware protection will affect the classification of premises wiring for the purposes of § 68.215, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Installation personnel.</E> Operations associated with the installation, connection, reconfiguration and removal (other than final removal of the entire premises communications system) of other than fully-protected premises <PRTPAGE P="535"/>wiring shall be performed under the supervision and control of a supervisor, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. The supervisor and installer may be the same person.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Supervision.</E> Operations by installation personnel shall be performed under the responsible supervision and control of a person who:</P>
              <P>(1) Has had at least six months of on-the-job experience in the installation of telephone terminal equipment or of wiring used with such equipment;</P>
              <P>(2) Has been trained by the registrant of the equipment to which the wiring is to be connected in the proper performance of any operations by installation personnel which could affect that equipment's continued compliance with these rules;</P>
              <P>(3) Has received written authority from the registrant to assure that the operations by installation personnel will be performed in such a manner as to comply with these rules.</P>
              <P>(4) Or, in lieu of paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section, is a licensed professional engineer in the jurisdiction in which the installation is performed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Workmanship and material requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Wiring shall be installed so as to assure that there is adequate insulation of telephone wiring from commercial power wiring and grounded surfaces. Wiring is required to be sheathed in an insulating jacket in addition to the insulation enclosing individual conductors (see below) unless located in an equipment enclosure or in an equipment room with restricted access; it shall be assured that this physical and electrical protection is not damaged or abraded during placement of the wiring. Any intentional removal of wiring insulation (or a sheath) for connections or splices shall be accomplished by removing the <E T="03">minimum</E> amount of insulation necessary to make the connection or splice, and insulation equivalent to that provided by the wire and its sheath shall be suitably restored, either by placement of the splices or connections in an appropriate enclosure, or equipment rooms with restricted access, or by using adequately-insulated connectors or splicing means.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Wire.</E> Insulated conductors shall have a jacket or sheath with a 1500 volt rms minimum breakdown rating, except when located in an equipment enclosure or an equipment room with restricted access. This rating shall be established by covering the jacket or sheath with at least 15 cm (6 in) (measured linearly on the cable) of conductive foil, and establishing a potential difference between the foil and all of the individual conductors connected together, such potential difference gradually increased over a 30 second time period to 1500 volts rms, 60 Hertz, then applied continuously for one minute. At no time during this 90 second time interval shall the current between these points exceed 10 milliamperes peak.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Places where the jacket or sheath has been removed.</E> Any point where the jacket or sheath has been removed (or is not required) shall be accessible for inspection. If such points are concealed, they shall be accessible without disturbing permanent building finish (e.g., by removing a cover).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Building and electrical codes.</E> All building and electrical codes applicable in the jurisdiction to telephone wiring shall be complied with. If there are no such codes applicable to telephone wiring, Article 800 of the 1978 National Electrical Code, entitled Communications Systems, and other sections of that Code incorporated therein by reference shall be complied with.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Limitations on electrical signals.</E> Only signal sources that emanate from the provider of wireline telecommunications central office, or that are generated in equipment at the customer's premises and are “non-hazardous voltage sources” as defined in the technical criteria published by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments, may be routed in premises telephone wiring, except for voltages for network control signaling and supervision that are consistent with standards employed by the provider of wireline telecommunications. Current on individual wiring conductors shall be limited to values which do not cause an excessive temperature rise, with due regard to insulation materials and ambient temperatures. The following table assumes a 45 °C temperature rise <PRTPAGE P="536"/>for wire sizes 22 AWG or larger, and a 40 °C rise for wire sizes smaller than 22 AWG, for poly-vinyl chloride insulating materials, and should be regarded as establishing <E T="03">maximum</E> values to be derated accordingly in specific installations where ambient temperatures are in excess of 25 °C:</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure for incoming-only (non-originating) lines or loops.</E> A telephone instrument may be associated directly or indirectly with the line or loop to perform this test if one is not ordinarily available to it:</P>
              <P>(i) Terminate the line or loop under test in a telephone instrument in the on-hook state.</P>
              <P>(ii) Dial the number of the line or loop under test from another station, blocking as necessary other lines or loops to cause the line or loop under test to be reached.</P>
              <P>(iii) On receipt of ringing on the line or loop under test, lift the handset of the telephone instrument to create the off-hook state on that line or loop.</P>
              <P>(iv) Listen for audible hum or excessive noise. Confirm that there is neither audible hum nor excessive noise.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure of acceptance test procedures.</E> Absence of dial tone before dialing, inability to break dial tone, or presence of audible hum or excessive noise (or any combination of these conditions) during test of two-way or outgoing lines or loops indicates failure. Inability to receive ringing, inability to break ringing by going off-hook, or presence of audible hum or excessive noise (or any combination of these conditions) during test of incoming-only lines or loops indicates failure. Upon any such failure, the failing equipment or portion of the premises communications system shall be disconnected from the network interface, and may not be reconnected until the cause of the failure has been isolated or removed. Any previously tested lines or loops shall be retested if they were in any way involved in the isolation and removal of the cause of the failure.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Monitoring or participation in acceptance testing by the provider of wireline telecommunications.</E> The provider of wireline telecommunications may monitor or participate in the acceptance testing required under this section, in accordance with § 68.215(g) of this part, from its central office test desk or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Extraordinary procedures.</E> The provider of wireline communications is hereby authorized to limit the subscriber's right of connecting approved terminal equipment or protective circuitry with other than fully-protected premises wiring, but solely in accordance with this paragraph and § 68.108 of these rules.</P>
              <P>(1)(i) <E T="03">Conditions that may invoke these procedures.</E> The extraordinary procedures authorized herein may only be invoked where one or more of the following conditions is present:</P>
              <P>(A) Information provided in the supervisor's affidavit gives reason to believe that a violation of part 68 of the FCC's rules is likely.</P>
              <P>(B) A failure has occurred during acceptance testing for imbalance.</P>
              <P>(C) Harm has occurred, and there is reason to believe that this harm was a result of wiring operations performed under this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The extraordinary procedures authorized in the following subsections shall not be used so as to discriminate between installations by provider of wireline telecommunications personnel and installations by others. In general, this requires that any charges for these procedures be levied in accordance with, or analogous to, the “maintenance of service” tariff provisions: If the installation proves satisfactory, no charge should be levied.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Monitoring or participation in acceptance testing for imbalance.</E> Notwithstanding the previous sub-section, the provider of wireline telecommunications may monitor or participate in <PRTPAGE P="538"/>acceptance testing for imbalance at the time of the initial installation of wiring in the absence of the conditions listed therein; at any other time, on or more of the listed conditions shall be present. Such monitoring or participation in acceptance testing should be performed from the central office test desk where possible to minimize costs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> Subject to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the provider of wireline telecommunications may inspect wiring installed pursuant to this section, and all of the splicing and connection points required to be accessible by § 68.215(d)(3) to determine compliance with this section. The user or installation supervisor shall either authorize the provider of wireline telecommunications to render the splicing and inspection points visible (e.g., by removing covers), or perform this action prior to the inspection. To minimize disruption of the premises communications system, the right of inspecting is limited as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) During initial installation of wiring:</P>
              <P>(A) The provider of wireline telecommunications may require withdrawal of up to 5 percent (measured linearly) of wiring run concealed in ducts, conduit or wall spaces, to determine conformance of the wiring to the information furnished in the affidavit.</P>
              <P>(B) In the course of any such inspection, the provider of wireline telecommunications shall have the right to inspect documentation required to be maintained at the premises under § 68.215(e).</P>
              <P>(ii) After failure of acceptance testing or after harm has resulted from installed wiring: The provider of wireline telecommunications may require withdrawal of all wiring run concealed in ducts, conduit or wall spaces which reasonably could have caused the failure or harm, to determine conformance of the wiring to the information furnished in the affidavit.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the course of any such inspection, the provider of wireline telecommunications shall have the right to inspect documentation required to be maintained at the premises under § 68.215(e).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Requiring the use of protective apparatus.</E> In the event that any of the conditions listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, arises, and is not permanently remedied within a reasonable time period, the provider of wireline telecommunications may require the use of protective apparatus that either protects solely against hazardous voltages, or that protects both against hazardous voltages and imbalance. Such apparatus may be furnished either by the provider of wireline telecommunications or by the customer. This right is in addition to the rights of the provider of wireline telecommunications under § 68.108.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice of the right to bring a complaint.</E> In any case where the provider of wireline telecommunications invokes the extraordinary procedures of § 68.215(g), it shall afford the customer the opportunity to correct the situation that gave rise to invoking these procedures, and inform the customer of the right to bring a complaint to the Commission pursuant to the procedures set forth in subpart E of this part. On complaint, the Commission reserves the right to perform any of the inspections authorized under this section, and to require the performance of acceptance tests.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Limitations on the foregoing if protected wiring requiring acceptance testing is used.</E> If protected wiring is used which required acceptance testing, the requirements in the foregoing paragraphs of § 68.215 are hereby limited, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Supervision.</E> Section 68.215(c)(2)-(3) are hereby waived. The supervisor is only required to have had at least six months of on-the-job experience in the installation of telephone terminal equipment or of wiring used with such equipment.</P>

                <P>(From EIA Standards Proposal No. 1652, formulated under the cognizance of EIA TR-41 Committee on Voice Telephone Terminals and the Hearing Industries Association's Standards and Technical Committee.)</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">1 Introduction</HD>
                <P>Hearing-aid users have used magnetic coupling to enable them to participate in telephone communications since the 1940's. Magnetic pick-ups in hearing-aids have provided for coupling to many, but not all, types of telephone handsets. A major reason for incompatibility has been the lack of handset magnetic field intensity requirements. Typically, whatever field existed had been provided fortuitously rather than by design. More recently, special handset designs, e.g., blue grommet handsets associated with public telephones, have been introduced to provide hearing-aid coupling and trials were conducted to demonstrate the acceptability of such designs. It is anticipated that there will be an increase in the number of new handset designs in the future. A standard definition of the magnetic field intensity emanating from telephone handsets intended to provide hearing-aid coupling is needed so that hearing-aid manufacturers can design their product to use this field, which will be guaranteed in handsets which comply with this standard.</P>
                <P>1.1 This standard is one of a series of technical standards on voice telephone terminal equipment prepared by EIA Engineering Committee TR-41. This document, with its companion standards on Private Branch Exchanges (PBX), Key Telephone Systems (KTS), Telephones and Environmental and Safety Considerations (Refs: A1, A2, A3 and A4) fills a recognized need in the telephone industry brought about by the increasing use in the public telephone network of equipment supplied by numerous manufacturers. It will be useful to anyone engaged in the manufacture of telephone terminal equipment and hearing-aids and to those purchasing, operating or using such equipment or devices.</P>
                <P>1.2 This standard is intended to be a living document, subject to revision and updating as warranted by advances in network and terminal equipment technology and changes in the FCC Rules and Regulations.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">2 Scope</HD>
                <P>2.1 The purpose of this document is to establish formal criteria defining the magnetic field intensity presented by a telephone to which hearing aids can couple. The requirements are based on present telecommunications plant characteristics at the telephone interface. The telephone will also be subject to the applicable requirements of EIA RS-470, Telephone Instruments with Loop Signaling for Voiceband Applications (Ref: A3) and the environmental requirements specified in EIA Standards Project PN-1361, Environmental and Safety Considerations for Voice Telephone Terminals, when published (Ref: A4).</P>
                <P>Telephones which meet these requirements should ensure satisfactory service to users of magnetically coupled hearing-aids in a high percentage of installations, both initially and over some period of time, as the network grows and changes occur in telephone serving equipment. However, due to the wide range of customer apparatus and loop plant and dependent on the environment in which the telephone and hearing aid are used, conformance with this standard does not guarantee acceptable performance or interface compatibility under all possible operating conditions.</P>

                <P>2.2 A telephone complies with this standard if it meets the requirements in this standard when manufactured and can be expected to continue to meet these requirements when properly used and maintained. For satisfactory service a telephone needs to be capable, through the proper selection of equipment options, of satisfying the requirements applicable to its marketing area.<PRTPAGE P="541"/>
                </P>
                <P>2.3 The standard is intended to be in conformance with part 68 of the FCC Rules and Regulations, but it is not limited to the scope of those rules (Ref: A5).</P>
                <P>2.4 The signal level and method of measurement in this standard have been chosen to ensure reproducible results and permit comparison of evaluations. The measured magnetic field intensity will be approximately 15 dB above the average level encountered in the field and the measured high-end frequency response will be greater than that encountered in the field.</P>
                <P>2.5 The basic accuracy and reproducibility of measurements made in accordance with this standard will depend primarily upon the accuracy of the test equipment used, the care with which the measurements are conducted, and the inherent stability of the devices under test.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">3 Definitions</HD>
                <P>This section contains definitions of terms needed for proper understanding and application of this standard which are not believed to be adequately treated elsewhere. A glossary of telephone terminology, which will be published as a companion volume to the series of technical standards on Telephone Terminals For Voiceband Applications, is recommended as a general reference and for definitions not covered in this section.</P>
                <P>3.1 A telephone is a terminal instrument which permits two-way, real-time voice communication with a distant party over a network or customer premises connection. It converts real-time voice and voiceband acoustic signals into electrical signals suitable for transmission over the telephone network and converts received electrical signals into acoustic signals. A telephone which meets the requirements of this standard also generates a magnetic field to which hearing-aids may couple.</P>
                <P>3.2 The telephone boundaries are the electrical interface with the network, PBX or KTS and the acoustic, magnetic and mechanical interfaces with the user. The telephone may also have an electrical interface with commercial power.</P>
                <P>3.3 A hearing aid is a personal electronic amplifying device, intended to increase the loudness of sound and worn to compensate for impaired hearing. When equipped with an optional inductive pick-up coil (commonly called a telecoil), a hearing aid can be used to amplify magnetic fields such as those from telephone receivers or induction-loop systems.</P>
                <P>3.4 The reference plane is the planar area containing points of the receiver-end of the handset which, in normal handset use, rest against the ear (see Fig 1).</P>
                <P>3.5 The measurement plane is parallel to, and 10 mm in front of, the reference plane (see Fig 1).</P>
                <P>3.6 The reference axis is normal to the reference plane and passes through the center of the receiver cap (or the center of the hole array, for handset types that do not have receiver caps).</P>
                <P>3.7 The measurement axis is parallel to the reference axis but may be displaced from that axis, by a maximum of 10 mm (see Fig 1). Within this constraint, the measurement axis may be located where the axial and radial field intensity measurements, are optimum with regard to the requirements. In a handset with a centered receiver and a circularly symmetrical magnetic field, the measurement axis and the reference axis would coincide.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hearing aid compatibility volume control: technical standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) A telephone manufactured in the United States or imported for use in the United States prior to February 28, 2020, complies with the volume control requirements of this section if it complies with:</P>
              <P>(i) The applicable provisions of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A telephone manufactured in the United States or imported for use in the United States on or after February 28, 2020, complies with the volume control requirements of this section if it complies with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) An analog telephone complies with the Commission's volume control requirements if the telephone is equipped with a receive volume control that provides, through the receiver in the handset or headset of the telephone, 12 dB of gain minimum and up to 18 dB of gain maximum, when measured in terms of Receive Objective Loudness Rating (ROLR), as defined in paragraph 4.1.2 of ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987 (Telephone Instruments With Loop Signaling) . The 12 dB of gain minimum must be achieved without significant clipping of the test signal. The telephone also shall comply with the upper and lower limits for ROLR given in table 4.4 of ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987 when the receive volume control is set to its normal unamplified level.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note 1 to paragraph (<E T="01">b</E>):</HD>
                <P>Paragraph 4.1.2 of ANSI/EIA-470-A-1987 identifies several characteristics related to the receive response of a telephone. It is only the normal unamplified ROLR level and the change in ROLR as a function of the volume control setting that are relevant to the specification of volume control as required by this section.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(c) The ROLR of an analog telephone shall be determined over the frequency range from 300 to 3300 HZ for short, average, and long loop conditions represented by 0, 2.7, and 4.6 km of 26 AWG nonloaded cable, respectively. The specified length of cable will be simulated by a complex impedance. (See Figure A.) The input level to the cable simulator shall be −10 dB with respect to 1 V open circuit from a 900 ohm source.</P>
              <P>(d) A digital telephone complies with the Commission's volume control requirements if the telephone is equipped with a receive volume control that provides, through the receiver of the handset or headset of the telephone, 12 dB of gain minimum and up to 18 dB of gain maximum, when measured in terms of Receive Objective Loudness Rating (ROLR), as defined in paragraph 4.3.2 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991 (Acoustic-To-Digital and Digital-To-Acoustic Transmission Requirements for ISDN Terminals). The 12 dB of gain minimum must be achieved without significant clipping of the test signal. The telephone also shall comply with the limits on the range for ROLR given in paragraph 4.3.2.2 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991 when the receive volume control is set to its normal unamplified level.</P>
              <P>(e) The ROLR of a digital telephone shall be determined over the frequency range from 300 to 3300 Hz using the method described in paragraph 4.3.2.1 of ANSI/EIA/TIA-579-1991. No variation in loop conditions is required for this measurement since the receive level of a digital telephone is independent of loop length.</P>

              <P>(f) The ROLR for either an analog or digital telephone shall first be determined with the receive volume control at its normal unamplified level. The minimum volume control setting shall be used for this measurement unless the manufacturer identifies a different setting for the nominal volume level. The ROLR shall then be determined with the receive volume control at its maximum volume setting. Since ROLR is a loudness rating value expressed in <PRTPAGE P="548"/>dB of loss, more positive values of ROLR represent lower receive levels. Therefore, the ROLR value determined for the maximum volume control setting should be subtracted from that determined for the nominal volume control setting to determine compliance with the gain requirement.</P>
              <P>(g) The 18 dB of receive gain may be exceeded provided that the amplified receive capability automatically resets to nominal gain when the telephone is caused to pass through a proper on-hook transition in order to minimize the likelihood of damage to individuals with normal hearing.</P>
              <P>(h) A telephone complies with the Commission's volume control requirements if it is equipped with a receive volume control that provides, through the receiver in the handset of the telephone, at the loudest volume setting, a conversational gain greater than or equal to 18 dB and less than or equal to 24 dB Conversational Gain when measured as described in ANSI/TIA-4965-2012 (Telecommunications—Telephone Terminal Equipment—Receive Volume Control Requirements for Digital and Analog Wireline Telephones). A minimum of 18 dB Conversational Gain must be achieved without significant clipping of the speech signal used for testing. The maximum 24 dB Conversational Gain may be exceeded if the amplified receive capability automatically resets to a level of not more than 24 dB Conversational Gain when the telephone is caused to pass through a proper on-hook transition, in order to minimize the likelihood of damage to individuals with normal hearing.</P>

              <P>(h) Local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee) of this chapter, shall file with this Commission a price cap tariff for access service for an annual period. Such tariffs shall be filed to meet the notice requirements of § 61.58 of this chapter, with a scheduled effective date of July 1. Such tariff filings shall be limited to changes in the Price Cap Indexes, rate level changes (with corresponding adjustments to the affected Actual Price Indexes and Service Band Indexes), and the incorporation of new services into the affected indexes as required by § 61.49 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(i) The following rules apply to the withdrawal from Association tariffs under the provision of paragraph (e)(6) or (e)(9) of this section or both by telephone companies electing to file price cap tariffs pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) In addition to the withdrawal provisions of paragraphs (e)(6) and (e)(9) of this section, a telephone company or group of affiliated companies that participates in one or more association tariffs during the current tariff year and that elects to file price cap tariffs or optional incentive regulation tariffs effective July 1 of the following tariff year shall notify the association by March 1 of the following tariff year that it is withdrawing from association tariffs, subject to the terms of this section, to participate in price cap regulation or optional incentive regulation.</P>
              <P>(2) The Association shall maintain records of such withdrawals sufficient to discharge its obligations under these Rules and to detect efforts by such companies or their affiliates to rejoin any Association tariffs in violation of the provisions of paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (e) (3), (6), and (9) of this section, in the event a telephone company withdraws from all Association tariffs for the purpose of filing price cap tariffs or optional incentive plan tariffs, such company shall exclude from such withdrawal all “average schedule” affiliates and all affiliates so excluded shall be specified in the withdrawal. However, such company may include one or more “average schedule” affiliates in price cap regulation or optional incentive plan regulation provided that each price cap or optional incentive plan affiliate relinquishes “average schedule” status and withdraws from all Association tariffs and any tariff filed pursuant to § 61.39(b)(2) of this chapter. See generally §§ 69.605(c), 61.39(b) of this chapter; MTS and WATS Market Structure: Average Schedule Companies, Report and Order, 103 FCC 2d 1026-1027 (1986).</P>
              <P>(4) If a telephone company elects to withdraw from Association tariffs and thereafter becomes subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(v) of this chapter, neither such telephone company nor any of its withdrawing affiliates shall thereafter be permitted to participate in any Association tariffs.</P>

              <P>(a) This section is applicable only to incumbent local exchange carriers that are not subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee) of this chapter. A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents per line per month shall be assessed upon end users that subscribe to local exchange telephone service or Centrex service to the extent they do not pay carrier common line charges. A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents per line per month shall be assessed upon providers of public telephones.

              <P>(b) Charges to multi-line subscribers shall be computed by multiplying a single line rate by the number of lines used by such subscriber.</P>
              <P>(c) Until December 31, 2001, except as provided in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, the single-line rate or charge shall be computed by dividing one-twelfth of the projected annual revenue requirement for the End User Common Line element by the projected average number of local exchange service subscriber lines in use during such annual period.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Until December 31, 2001, if the monthly charge computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section exceeds $6, the charge for each local exchange service subscriber line, except a residential line, a single-line business line, or a line used for Centrex-CO service that was in place or on order as of July 27, 1983, shall be $6.</P>
              <P>(2) Until December 31, 2001, the charge for each subscriber line associated with a public telephone shall be equal to the monthly charge computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Until December 31, 2001, the monthly charge for each residential and single-line business local exchange service subscriber shall be the charge computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or $3.50, whichever is lower.</P>
              <P>(f) Except as provided in § 54.403 of this chapter, the charge for each residential local exchange service subscriber line shall be the same as the charge for each single-line business local exchange service subscriber line.</P>
              <P>(g) A line shall be deemed to be a residential line if the subscriber pays a rate for such line that is described as a residential rate in the local exchange service tariff.</P>

              <P>(h) A line shall be deemed to be a single line business line if the subscriber pays a rate that is not described as a residential rate in the local exchange service tariff and does not obtain more <PRTPAGE P="568"/>than one such line from a particular telephone company.</P>
              <P>(i) The End User Common Line charge for each multi-party subscriber shall be assessed as if such subscriber had subscribed to single-party service.</P>

              <P>(n)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (r) and (s) of this section, the maximum monthly charge for each residential or single-line business local exchange service subscriber line shall be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) One-twelfth of the projected annual revenue requirement for the End User Common Line element divided by the projected average number of local exchange service subscriber lines in use during such annual period; or</P>
              <P>(ii) $6.50.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that GDP-PI exceeds 6.5% or is less than 0%, the maximum monthly charge in paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section will be adjusted in the same manner as the adjustment in § 69.152(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(o)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (r) and (s) of this section, the maximum monthly End User Common Line Charge for multi-line business lines will be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) $9.20; or</P>
              <P>(ii) One-twelfth of the projected annual revenue requirement for the End User Common Line element divided by the projected average number of local exchange service subscriber lines in use during such annual period;</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that GDP-PI is greater than 6.5% or is less than 0%, the maximum monthly charge in paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section will be adjusted in the same manner as the adjustment in § 69.152(k)(2).</P>

              <P>(q) In the event a non-price cap local exchange carrier charges less than the maximum End User Common Line charge for any subscriber lines, the carrier may not recover the difference between the amount collected and the maximum from carrier common line charges, Interstate Common Line Support, or Long Term Support.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">End User Common Line charge deaveraging.</E> Beginning on January 1, 2002, non-price cap local exchange carriers may geographically deaverage End User Common Line charges subject to the following conditions.</P>
              <P>(1) In order for a non-price cap local exchange carrier to be allowed to deaverage End User Common Line charges within a study area, the non-price cap local exchange carrier must have:</P>
              <P>(i) State commission-approved geographically deaveraged rates for UNE loops within that study area; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A universal service support disaggregation plan established pursuant to § 54.315 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) All geographic deaveraging of End User Common Line charges by customer class within a study area must be according to the state commission-approved UNE loop zone, or the universal service support disaggregation plan established pursuant to § 54.315 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(4) For any given class of customer in any given zone, the End User Common Line Charge in that zone must be greater than or equal to the End User Common Line charge in the zone with the next lower cost per line.</P>
              <P>(5) A non-price cap local exchange carrier shall not receive more through deaveraged End User Common Line charges than it would have received if it had not deaveraged its End User Common Line charges.</P>

              <P>(a) This section is applicable only to local exchange carriers that are not subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee) of this chapter. Until June 30, 2003, a charge that is expressed in dollars and cents per line per access minute of use shall be assessed upon all interexchange carriers that use local exchange common line facilities for the provision of interstate or foreign telecommunications services, except that the charge shall not be assessed upon interexchange carriers to the extent they resell MTS or MTS-type services of other common carriers (OCCs).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) For purposes of this section and § 69.113:</P>
              <P>(i) A carrier or other person shall be deemed to receive premium access if access is provided through a local exchange switch that has the capability to provide access for an MTS-WATS equivalent service that is substantially equivalent to the access provided for MTS or WATS, except that access provided for an MTS-WATS equivalent service that does not use such capability shall not be deemed to be premium access until six months after the carrier that provides such MTS-WATS equivalent service receives actual notice that such equivalent access is or will be available at such switch;</P>
              <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">open end</E> of a call describes the origination or termination of a call that utilizes exchange carrier common line plant (a call can have no, one, or two open ends); and</P>
              <P>(iii) All open end minutes on calls with one open end (e.g., an 800 or FX call) shall be treated as terminating minutes.</P>
              <P>(2) For association Carrier Common Line tariff participants:</P>
              <P>(i) The premium originating Carrier Common Line charge shall be one cent per minute, except as described in § 69.105(b)(3), and</P>
              <P>(ii) The premium terminating Carrier Common Line charge shall be computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For each telephone company subject to price cap regulation, multiply the company's proposed premium originating rate by a number equal to the sum of the premium originating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium originating base period minutes of that telephone company;</P>

              <P>(B) For each telephone company subject to price cap regulation, multiply the company's proposed premium terminating rate by a number equal to the sum of the premium terminating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium <PRTPAGE P="570"/>terminating base period minutes of that telephone company;</P>
              <P>(C) Sum the numbers computed in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section for all companies subject to price cap regulation;</P>
              <P>(D) From the number computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, subtract a number equal to one cent times the sum of the premium originating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium originating base period minutes of all telephone companies subject to price cap regulation, and;</P>
              <P>(E) Divide the number computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section by the sum of the premium terminating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium terminating base period minutes of all telephone companies subject to price cap regulation.</P>
              <P>(3) If the calculations described in § 69.105(b)(2) result in a per minute charge on premium terminating minutes that is less than once cent, both the originating and terminating premium charges for the association CCL tariff participants shall be computed by dividing the number computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section by a number equal to the sum of the premium originating and terminating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the sum of the non-premium originating and terminating base period minutes of all telephone companies subject to price cap regulation.</P>
              <P>(4) The Carrier Common Line charges of telephone companies that are not association Carrier Common Line tariff participants shall be computed at the level of Carrier Common Line access element aggregation selected by such telephone companies pursuant to § 69.3(e)(7).

              <P>(a) Except as provided in § 69.118, charges that are expressed in dollars and cents per access minute of use shall be assessed by local exchange carriers that are not subject to price cap <PRTPAGE P="571"/>regulation upon all interexchange carriers that use local exchange switching facilities for the provision of interstate or foreign services.</P>
              <P>(b) The per minute charge described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be computed by dividing the projected annual revenue requirement for the Local Switching element, excluding any local switching support received by the carrier pursuant to § 54.301 of this chapter, by the projected annual access minutes of use for all interstate or foreign services that use local exchange switching facilities.</P>
              <P>(c) If end users of an interstate or foreign service that uses local switching facilities pay message unit charges for such calls in a particular exchange, a credit shall be deducted from the Local Switching element charges to such carrier for access service in such exchange. The per minute credit for each such exchange shall be multiplied by the monthly access minutes for such service to compute the monthly credit to such a carrier.</P>
              <P>(d) If all local exchange subscribers in such exchange pay message unit charges, the per minute credit described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be computed by dividing total message unit charges to all subscribers in a particular exchange in a representative month by the total minutes of use that were measured for purposes of computing message unit charges in such month.</P>
              <P>(e) If some local exchange subscribers pay message unit charges and some do not, a per minute credit described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be computed by multiplying a credit computed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section by a factor that is equal to total minutes measured in such month for purposes of computing message unit charges divided by the total local exchange minutes in such month.</P>
              <P>(f) Except as provided in § 69.118, price cap local exchange carriers shall establish rate elements for local switching as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Price cap local exchange carriers shall separate from the projected annual revenues for the Local Switching element those costs projected to be incurred for ports (including cards and DS1/voice-grade multiplexers required to access end offices equipped with analog switches) on the trunk side of the local switch. Price cap local exchange carriers shall further identify costs incurred for dedicated trunk ports separately from costs incurred for shared trunk ports.</P>
              <P>(i) Price cap local exchange carriers shall recover dedicated trunk port costs identified pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section through flat-rated charges expressed in dollars and cents per trunk port and assessed upon the purchaser of the dedicated trunk terminating at the port.</P>
              <P>(ii) Price cap local exchange carriers shall recover shared trunk port costs identified pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section through charges assessed upon purchasers of shared transport. This charge shall be expressed in dollars and cents per access minute of use. The charge shall be computed by dividing the projected costs of the shared ports by the historical annual access minutes of use calculated for purposes of recovery of common transport costs in § 69.111(c).</P>
              <P>(2) Price cap local exchange carriers shall recover the projected annual revenues for the Local Switching element that are not recovered in paragraph (f)(1) of this section through charges that are expressed in dollars and cents per access minute of use and assessed upon all interexchange carriers that use local exchange switching facilities for the provision of interstate or foreign services. The maximum charge shall be computed by dividing the projected remainder of the annual revenues for the Local Switching element by the historical annual access minutes of use for all interstate or foreign services that use local exchange switching facilities.</P>

              <P>(g) A local exchange carrier may recover signaling costs associated with call setup through a call setup charge imposed upon all interstate interexchange carriers that use that local exchange carrier's facilities to originate or terminate interstate interexchange or foreign services. This charge must be expressed as dollars and cents per call attempt and may be assessed on originating calls handed off to the interexchange carrier's point of <PRTPAGE P="572"/>presence and on terminating calls received from an interexchange carrier's point of presence, whether or not that call is completed at the called location. Local exchange carriers may not recover through this charge any costs recovered through other rate elements.</P>
              <P>(h) Except as provided in § 69.118, non-price cap local exchange carriers may establish rate elements for local switching as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Non-price cap local exchange carriers may separate from the projected annual revenue requirement for the Local Switching element those costs projected to be incurred for ports (including cards and DS1/voice-grade multiplexers required to access end offices equipped with analog switches) on the trunk side of the local switch. Non-price cap local exchange carriers electing to assess these charges shall further identify costs incurred for dedicated trunk ports separately from costs incurred for shared trunk ports.</P>
              <P>(i) Non-price cap local exchange carriers electing to assess trunk port charges shall recover dedicated trunk port costs identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section through flat-rated charges expressed in dollars and cents per trunk port and assessed upon the purchaser of the dedicated trunk terminating at the port.</P>
              <P>(ii) Non-price cap local exchange carriers electing to assess trunk port charges shall recover shared trunk port costs identified pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section through charges assessed upon purchasers of shared transport. This charge shall be expressed in dollars and cents per access minute of use. The charge shall be computed by dividing the projected costs of the shared ports by the historical annual access minutes of use calculated for purposes of recovery of common transport costs in § 69.111(c).</P>

Alternatively, the telephone company may adjust its initial transport rates so that the DS3-to-DS1 ratio calculated as described in paragraph (a) of this section of those rates is 9.6 or higher. In that case, initial transport rates that depart from existing special access rates effective on September 1, 1992 so as to be consistent with the benchmark will be presumed reasonable only so long as the ratio of revenue recovered through the interconnection charge to the revenue recovered through facilities-based charges is the same as it would be if <PRTPAGE P="573"/>the telephone company's existing special access rates effective on September 1, 1992 were used.</P>

              <P>(q) <E T="03">End User Common Line Charge De-Averaging.</E> Beginning on July 1, 2000, local exchange carriers may geographically deaverage End User Common Line charges subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) In order for a price cap local exchange carrier to be allowed to de-average End User Common Line charges within a study area, the price cap local exchange carrier must have state Commission approved geographically deaveraged rates for UNE loops within that study area. Except where a LEC geographically deaverages through voluntary reductions, before a price cap local exchange carrier may geographically deaverage its End User Common Line rates, its Originating and Terminating CCL and Multi-line Business PICC rates in that study area must equal $0.00.</P>
              <P>(2) All geographic deaveraging of End User Common Line charges by customer class within a study area must be according to the state commission-approved UNE loop zone. Solely for the purposes of determining interstate subscriber line charges and the interstate access universal service support described in §§ 54.806 and 54.807 of this chapter, a price cap local exchange carrier may not have more than four geographic End User Common Line Charge/Universal Service zones absent a review by the Commission. Where a price cap local exchange carrier has more than four state-created UNE zones and the Commission has not approved use of additional zones, the price cap local exchange carrier will determine, at its discretion, which state-created UNE zones to consolidate so that it has no more than four zones for the purpose of determining interstate subscriber line charges and interstate access universal service support.</P>
              <P>(3) Within a given zone, Multi-line Business End User Common Line rates cannot fall below Primary Residential and Single-Line Business or Non-Primary Residential End User Common Line charges. Non-Primary End User Common Line charges cannot fall below Primary Residential and Single-Line Business charges.</P>

              <P>(4) For any given class of customer in any given zone, the Zone deaveraged End User Common Line Charge in that <PRTPAGE P="587"/>zone must be greater than or equal to the Zone deaveraged End User Common Line charge in the zone with the next lower Zone Average Revenue Per Line.</P>
              <P>(5) The sum of all revenues per month that would be generated from all deaveraged End User Common Line charges in all zones within a study area plus Interstate Access Universal Service Support per Line month (as defined in § 54.807 of this chapter) for the applicable customer classes and zones receiving such support multiplied by corresponding base period lines, divided by the number of base period lines in that study area cannot exceed Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month as defined in § 61.3(d) of this chapter for that study area. In addition, the sum of revenues per month that would be generated from all deaveraged End User Common Line charges in all End User Common Line charge deaveraging zones within a study area plus revenues per month from all End User Common Line charge, multi-line business PICC and CCL charges from study areas within that study area that have not geographically deaveraged End User Common Line charges plus the sum of all Interstate Access Universal Service Support per Line month (as defined in § 54.807 of this chapter) for the applicable customer classes and zones receiving such support, multiplied by the corresponding base period lines for the applicable customer classes and zones within the study area, divided by the number of total base period lines in the study area cannot exceed Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month as defined in § 61.3(d) of this chapter for the study area.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Maximum charge.</E> The maximum zone deaveraged End User Common Line Charge that may be charged in any zone is the applicable cap specified in § 69.152(d)(1), § 69.152(e)(1)(i) or § 69.152 (k)(1)(i) Zone Average Revenue Per Line is the Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month allocated to a particular state-defined zone used for deaveraging of UNE loop prices. The zone average revenue per line is computed pursuant to § 61.3 (zz) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Minimum charge.</E> Except where a local exchange carrier chooses to lower the deaveraged End User Common Line charge through voluntary reductions, the minimum zone deaveraged End User Common Line charge in any zone in a study area is at least the Minimum End User Common Line charge. Minimum End User Common Line charge is Zone Average Revenue Per Line for the zone with the lowest Zone Average Revenue Per Line in that study area plus an amount per line calculated to recover the difference between Interstate Access Universal Service Support Per Line (as defined in § 54.807 of this chapter) multiplied by base period lines for the applicable customer class and zones receiving such support and Study Area Above Benchmark Revenues, first from Zone 1 until the End User Common Line charges in Zone 1 equal the End User Common Line charges in Zone 2, and then from lines in Zones 1 and 2 equally until the End User Common Line charges in those Zones reach Zone 3 (with all End User Common Line charges subject to the applicable residential and multi-line business lines nominal caps).</P>
              <P>(i) For the purposes of this part, “Study Area Above Benchmark Revenues” is the sum of all Zone Above Benchmark Revenues.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the purposes of this part, “Zone Above Benchmark Revenues” is calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>Zone Above Benchmark Revenues is the sum of Zone Above Benchmark Revenues for Residential and Single-line Business lines and Zone Above Benchmark Revenues for Multi-line Business lines. Zone Above Benchmark Revenues for Residential and Single-line Business lines is, within each zone, (Zone Average Revenue Per Line minus $7.00) multiplied by all eligible telecommunications carrier Base Period Residential and Single-line Business lines times 12. If negative, the Zone Above Benchmark Revenues for Residential and Single-line Business lines for the zone is zero. Zone Above Benchmark Revenues for Multi-line Business lines is, within each zone,</P>

              <P>(Zone Average Revenue Per Line minus $9.20) multiplied by all eligible telecommunications carrier zone Base Period Multi-line Business lines times <PRTPAGE P="588"/>12. If negative, the Zone Above Benchmark Revenues for Multi-line Business lines for the zone is zero.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Voluntary Reductions.</E> A “Voluntary Reduction” is one in which the local exchange carrier reduces prices other than through offset of net increases in End User Common Line charge revenues or Interstate Access Universal Service support received pursuant to § 54.807 of this chapter, or through increases in other zone deaveraged End User Common Line charges.</P>

              <P>(a) Local exchange carriers may recover a per-minute carrier common line charge from interexchange carriers, collected on originating access minutes and calculated using the weighting method set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. The maximum such charge shall be the lower of:</P>
              <P>(1) The per-minute rate using base period demand that would recover the maximum allowable carrier common line revenue as defined in § 61.46(d) of this chapter; or</P>
              <P>(2) The sum of the local switching, carrier common line and interconnection charge charges assessed on originating minutes on December 31, 1997, minus the local switching charges assessed on originating minutes.</P>
              <P>(b) To the extent that paragraph (a) of this section does not recover from interexchange carriers all permitted carrier common line revenue, the excess may be collected through a per-minute charge on terminating access calculated using the weighting method set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) For each Carrier Common Line access element tariff, the premium originating Carrier Common Line charge shall be set at a level that recovers revenues allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The non-premium charges shall be equal to .45 multiplied by the premium charges.</P>

              <P>(a) Local exchange carriers may recover a per-minute residual interconnection charge on originating access. The maximum such charge shall be the lower of:</P>
              <P>(1) The per-minute rate that would recover the total annual residual interconnection charge revenues permitted less the portion of the residual interconnection charge allowed to be recovered under § 69.153; or</P>
              <P>(2) The sum of the local switching, carrier common line and residual interconnection charges assessed on originating minutes on December 31, 1997, minus the local switching charges assessed on originating minutes, less the maximum amount allowed to be recovered under § 69.154(a).</P>
              <P>(b) To the extent that paragraph (a) of this section prohibits a local exchange carrier from recovering all of the residual interconnection charge revenues permitted, the residual may be collected through a per-minute charge on terminating access.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) No portion of the charge assessed pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section that recovers revenues that the local exchange carrier anticipates will be reassigned to other, facilities-based rate elements, including the tandem-switching rate element described in § 69.111(g), the three-part tandem switched transport rate structure described in § 69.111(a)(2), and port and multiplexer charges described in § 69.111(l), shall be assessed upon minutes utilizing the local exchange carrier's local switching facilities, but not the local exchange carrier's transport service.</P>
              <P>(2) If a local exchange carrier cannot recover its full residual interconnection charge revenues through the PICC mechanism established in § 69.153, and will consequently cover a portion of its residual interconnection charge revenues through per-minute charges assessed pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, then the local exchange carrier must allocate its residual interconnection charge revenues subject to the exemption established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section between the PICC and the per-minute residual interconnection charge in the same proportion as other residual interconnection charge revenues are allocated between these two recovery mechanisms.</P>

These contributions are not a part of any price cap baskets, and the charge to recover these contributions is not part of any other element established pursuant to part 69. Such a charge may be assessed on a per-line basis or as a percentage of interstate retail revenues, and at the option of the local exchange carrier it may be combined for billing purposes <PRTPAGE P="590"/>with other end user retail rate elements. A local exchange carrier opting to assess the Universal Service end-user rate element on a per-line basis may apply that charge using the “equivalency” relationships established for the multi-line business PICC for Primary Rate ISDN service, as per § 69.153(d), and for Centrex lines, as per § 69.153(e).</P>

        <SUBJECT>OMB control numbers and expiration dates assigned pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section displays the OMB control numbers and expiration dates for the Commission information collection requirements assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13. The Commission intends that this section comply with the requirement that agencies “display” current OMB control numbers and expiration dates assigned by the Director, OMB, for each approved information collection requirement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) that does not display a currently valid OMB control number. The expiration dates shown in this section are accurate as of January 31, 2017. New, revised, or extended information collections approved by OMB after that date can be found at <E T="03">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain.</E> Questions concerning the OMB control numbers and expiration dates should be directed to the Associate Managing Director—Performance Evaluation and Records Management, (PERM), Office of Managing Director, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554 by sending an email to <E T="03">PRA@fcc.gov.</E>
