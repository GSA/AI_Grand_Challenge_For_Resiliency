      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(ii) A lease in a planning area offshore Alaska.</P>
              <P>(3) On a pre-Act lease in the GOM, the project:</P>
              <P>(i) Must significantly increase the ultimate recovery of resources from one or more reservoirs that have not previously produced (extending recovery from reservoirs already in production does not constitute a significant increase); and</P>

              <P>(ii) Must involve a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-leg platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, multiple well project, <E T="03">etc.</E>).</P>
              <P>(4) For a lease issued in a planning area offshore Alaska, or in the GOM after November 28, 2000, the project must involve a new well drilled into a reservoir that has not previously produced.</P>

              <P>(a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote increased production.</P>
              <P>(b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to leases in the GOM that are west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and in the planning areas offshore Alaska.</P>
              <P>(c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of new production from any lease if:</P>
              <P>(1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);</P>
              <P>(2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);</P>
              <P>(3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA (before November 28, 1995);</P>
              <P>(4) We find that your new production would not be economic without royalty relief; and</P>
              <P>(5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or a supplementary DOCD, that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approved after November 28, 1995.</P>
              <P>(d) Under 42 U.S.C. 15904-15905, we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of gas production from deep and ultra-deep wells on a lease if:</P>
              <P>(1) Your lease is in shallow water (water less than 400 meters deep) and you produce from an ultra-deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS) or your lease is in waters entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep and you produce from a deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS);</P>
              <P>(2) Your lease is in the designated area of the GOM (wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude); and</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>

                  <P>In 2008, you drill and begin producing from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS, and your lease has had no prior production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Assuming your lease has no deepwater royalty relief (see § 203.30(c)), your lease is eligible (according to § 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV under § 203.31 because it has not yet produced from a deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing. According to § 203.31(a), your 25,000 foot well qualifies your lease for this RSV because the well was drilled after the relief authorized here became effective (when the proposed version of this rule was published on May 18, 2007) and produced from an interval that meets the criteria for an ultra-deep well (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> is a phase 2 ultra-deep well as defined in § 203.0). Then in 2014, you drill and produce from another ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 29,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no additional RSV under this section when this second ultra-deep well produces, because your lease no longer meets the condition in (§ 203.30(b)) of no production from a deep well. However, any remaining RSV earned by the first ultra-deep well on your lease would be applied to production from both the first and the second ultra-deep wells as prescribed in § 203.33(a)(2), or § 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit.</P>

                  <P>In 2005, you spudded and began producing from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 23,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under this section from this phase 1 ultra-deep well (as defined in § 203.0) because you spudded the well before the publication date (May 18, 2007) of the proposed rule when royalty relief under § 203.31(a) became effective. However, this ultra-deep well may earn an RSV of 25 BCF for your lease under § 203.41 (that became effective May 3, 2004), if the lease is located in water depths partly or entirely less than 200 meters and has not previously produced from a deep well (§ 203.30(b)).</P>

Then in 2008, you drill and produce from a new ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 24,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under either this section or § 203.41 because the 16,000-foot well was drilled before we offered any way to earn an RSV for producing from a deep well (see dates in the definition of qualified well in § 203.0) and because the existence of the 16,000-foot well means the lease is not eligible (see § 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV for the 24,000-foot well. Because the lease existed in the year 2000, it cannot be eligible for the exception to this eligibility condition provided in § 203.31(b).</P>

Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing because your lease meets the conditions in § 203.30 and the well fits the definition of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (in § 203.0). Then in 2010, you spud and produce from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS. Your 16,000-foot well earns no RSV because it is on a lease that already has a producing well at least 18,000 feet subsea (see § 203.42(a)), but any remaining RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would also be applied to production from the deep well as prescribed in § 203.33(a)(2), or § 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit and § 203.43(a)(2), <PRTPAGE P="16"/>or § 203.43(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit. However, if the 16,000-foot deep well does not begin production until 2016 (or if your lease were located in water less than 200 meters deep), then the 16,000-foot well would not be a qualified deep well because this well does not begin production within the interval specified in the definition of a qualified well in § 203.0, and the RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would not be applied to production from this (unqualified) deep well.</P>

                  <P>In 2008, you spud a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under § 203.41 when it begins producing. Then in 2011, you spud an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 26,000 feet TVD SS. Your 26,000-foot well becomes a qualified ultra-deep well because it meets the date and depth conditions in this definition under § 203.0 when it begins producing, but your lease earns no additional RSV under this section or § 203.41 because it is on a lease that already has production from a deep well (see § 203.30(b)). Both the qualified deep well and the qualified ultra-deep well would share your lease's total RSV of 15 BCF in the manner prescribed in §§ 203.33 and 203.43.</P>

                  <P>In 2008, you spud a qualified ultra-deep well that is a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of 21,000 feet and a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS. This well meets the definition of an ultra-deep well but is too long to be classified an ultra-deep short sidetrack in § 203.0. If your lease is located in 150 meters of water and has not previously produced from a deep well, your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF because it was drilled after the effective date for earning this RSV. Further, this RSV applies to gas production from this and any future qualified deep and qualified ultra-deep wells on your lease, as prescribed in § 203.33. The absence of an expiration date for earning an RSV on an ultra-deep well means this long sidetrack well becomes a qualified well whenever it starts production. If your sidetrack has a sidetrack measured depth of 14,000 feet and begins production in March 2009, it earns an RSV of 12.4 BCF under this section because it meets the definitions of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (production begins before the expiration date for the pre-existing relief in its water depth category) and an ultra-deep short sidetrack in § 203.0. However, if it does not begin production until 2010, it earns no RSV because it is too short as a phase 3 ultra-deep well to be a qualified ultra-deep well.</P>

Then in February 2008, you spud an ultra-deep well (well no. 2) with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,300 feet that begins producing in November 2008, after well no. 1 has started production. Well no. 2 earns your lease an additional RSV of 10 BCF under paragraph (b) of this section because it begins production in time to be classified as a phase 2 ultra-deep well. If, on the other hand, well no. 2 had begun producing in June 2009, it would earn no additional RSV for the lease because it would be classified as a phase 3 ultra-deep well and thus is not entitled to the exception under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

If the non-unitized qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF, and the unitized qualified well on lease A produces 18 BCF, and the qualified well on lease B produces 37 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which the lease A RSV applies is 34 BCF [12 + (18 + 37)(0.40)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies is 33 BCF [(18 + 37)(0.60)]. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.</P>

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                  <P>Assume that a lessee drills and begins producing from a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well in 2008 on a lease issued in 2004 in less than 200 meters of water that earns the lease an RSV of 35 BCF. Further, assume the well produces a total of 18 BCF by the end of 2009 and in both of those years, the average daily NYMEX closing natural gas price is less than $10.15 (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The lessee does not pay royalty on the 18 BCF because the gas price threshold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to the first 25 BCF of this RSV earned by this phase 2 ultra-deep well. In 2010, the well produces another 13 BCF. In that year, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price is greater than $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), but less than $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The first 7 BCF produced in 2010 will exhaust the first 25 BCF (that is subject to the $10.15 threshold) of the 35 BCF RSV that the well earned. The lessee must pay royalty on the remaining 6 BCF produced in 2010, because it is subject to the $4.55 per MMBtu threshold under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section which was exceeded.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
                  <P>Assume that a lessee:</P>
                  <P>(1) Drills and produces from well no.1, a qualified deep well in 2008 to a depth of 15,500 feet TVD SS that earns a 15 BCF RSV for the lease under § 203.41, which would be subject to a price threshold of $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), meaning the lease is partly or entirely in less than 200 meters of water;</P>
                  <P>(2) Later in 2008, drills and produces from well no. 2, a second qualified deep well to a depth of 17,000 feet TVD SS that earns no additional RSV (see § 203.41(c)(1)); and</P>
                  <P>(3) In 2015, drills and produces from well no. 3, a qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns no additional RSV since the lease already has an RSV established by prior deep well production. Further assume that in 2015, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). In 2015, any remaining RSV earned by well no. 1 (which would have been applied to production from well nos. 1 and 2 in the intervening years), would be applied to production from all three qualified wells. Because the price threshold applicable to that RSV was not exceeded, the production from all three qualified wells would be royalty-free until the 15 BCF RSV earned by well no. 1 is exhausted.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3:</HD>

                  <P>Assume the same initial facts regarding the three wells as in Example 2. Further assume that well no. 1 stopped producing in 2011 after it had produced 8 BCF, and that well no. 2 stopped producing in 2012 after it had produced 5 BCF. Two BCF of the RSV earned by well no. 1 remain. That RSV would be applied to production from well no. <PRTPAGE P="20"/>3 until it is exhausted, and the lessee therefore would not pay royalty on those 2 BCF produced in 2015, because the $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) price threshold is not exceeded. The determination of which price threshold applies to deep gas production depends on when the first qualified well earned the RSV for the lease, not on which wells use the RSV.</P>

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4:</HD>
                  <P>Assume that in February 2010, a lessee completes and begins producing from an ultra-deep well (at a depth of 21,500 feet TVD SS) on a lease located in 325 meters of water with no prior production from any deep well and no deep water royalty relief. The ultra-deep well would be a phase 2 ultra-deep well (see definition in § 203.0), and would earn the lease an RSV of 35 BCF under §§ 203.30 and 203.31. Further assume that the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) during 2010. Because the lease is located in more than 200 but less than 400 meters of water, the $4.55 per MMBtu price threshold applies to the whole RSV (see paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section), and the lessee will owe royalty on all gas produced from the ultra-deep well in 2010.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(d) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.</P>

                <P>(c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application may contain more accurate information that does not support our original assessment.

                <P>(a) For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application for all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of application, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and § 203.64. However, we will evaluate all acreage that may eventually become part of the authorized field. Therefore, if you have any other leases that you believe may eventually be part of the authorized field, you must submit data for these leases according to § 203.81.</P>
                <P>(1) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with updates of all leases in each designated field.</P>

Your application is not complete until we receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and reasons for our determinations under § 203.67.</P>
                <P>(3) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not participate, that lease is ineligible for the royalty relief for the designated field.</P>
                <P>(b) If your application seeks only relief for a development project or an expansion project, your application does not have to include all leases in the field.</P>

                <P>(d) If the lease has earned or may earn deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.40 through 203.49 or ultra-deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.30 through 203.36, we will take the deep gas royalty relief or ultra-deep gas royalty relief into account in determining whether further royalty relief for a development project is necessary for production to be economic.</P>

                <P>The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease terms, as prescribed in this section.</P>

Under certain conditions you may also request a redetermination if we deny your application or if you want your approved royalty suspension volume to change.

                <P>(a) You have significant new G&amp;G data and you previously have not either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. “Significant” means that the new G&amp;G data:</P>
                <P>(1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);</P>

                <P>(2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and<PRTPAGE P="35"/>

                <P>(3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our earlier determination.</P>
                <P>(b) You demonstrate in your new application that the technology that most efficiently develops this field or lease was not considered or deemed feasible in the original application. Your newly proposed technology must improve the profitability, under equivalent market conditions, of the field or lease relative to the development system proposed in the prior application.</P>
                <P>(c) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent from your base reference price as calculated under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(1) Your current reference price is a weighted-average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;</P>

                <P>(3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated with the most likely scenario (identified in §§ 203.85 and 203.88) from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.</P>
                <P>(d) Before starting to build your development and production system, you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the most likely scenario from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.</P>

                <P>If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application and pay the required fee, as discussed in § 203.62. We will evaluate your application under § 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.</P>

                <P>We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following reasons.</P>

                <P>(a) You change the type of development system proposed in your application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production system, or from an independent development and production system to one with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, <E T="03">etc.</E>).</P>
                <P>(b) You do not start building the proposed development and production system within 18 months of the date we approved your application, unless the BSEE Director grants you an extension under § 203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then suspend its construction before completion, and you do not restart continuous building of the proposed system within 18 months of our approval, we will withdraw the relief we granted.</P>
                <P>(c) Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production development report (§ 203.70). Development costs are those expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between the application submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50 percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources anticipated in your application.</P>

                <P>(d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified for a redetermination under § 203.74(c), and we find out your actual development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. Development costs are those <PRTPAGE P="36"/>expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between your application submission date and start of production.</P>
                <P>(e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the post-production development report, or you provide false or intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late-payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54 on all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. You also may be subject to penalties under other provisions of law.</P>

Unless your lease lies offshore of Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. Before you may apply for royalty relief apart from our programs for end-of-life leases or for pre-Act deep water leases and development and expansion projects, we must agree that your lease or project has two or more of the following characteristics:</P>
                <P>(a) The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional resources mean enough to allow production for at least a year more than would be profitable without royalty relief.</P>
                <P>(b) Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease, their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.</P>
                <P>(c) A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the resources.</P>
                <P>(d) The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent significant change in operations).</P>
                <P>(e) Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.</P>

                <P>(a) Before you weld, you must move any equipment containing hydrocarbons or other flammable substances at least 35 feet horizontally from the welding area. You must move similar equipment on lower decks at least 35 feet from the point of impact where slag, sparks, or other burning materials could fall. If moving this equipment is impractical, you must protect that equipment with flame-proofed covers, shield it with metal or fire-resistant guards or curtains, or render the flammable substances inert.<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) While you weld, you must monitor all water-discharge-point sources from hydrocarbon-handling vessels. If a discharge of flammable fluids occurs, you must stop welding.</P>
                <P>(c) If you cannot weld in one of the designated safe-welding areas that you listed in your safe welding plan, you must meet the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) You may not begin welding until:</P>
                <P>(i) The welding supervisor or designated person in charge advises in writing that it is safe to weld.</P>

                <P>(2) During welding, the person in charge must designate one or more persons as a fire watch. The fire watch must:</P>
                <P>(i) Have no other duties while actual welding is in progress;</P>
                <P>(ii) Have usable firefighting equipment;</P>
                <P>(iii) Remain on duty for 30 minutes after welding activities end; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Maintain a continuous surveillance with a portable gas detector during the welding and burning operation if welding occurs in an area not equipped with a gas detector.</P>
                <P>(3) You may not weld piping, containers, tanks, or other vessels that have contained a flammable substance unless you have rendered the contents inert and the designated person in charge has determined it is safe to weld. This does not apply to approved hot taps.</P>
                <P>(4) You may not weld within 10 feet of a wellbay unless you have shut in all producing wells in that wellbay.</P>
                <P>(5) You may not weld within 10 feet of a production area, unless you have shut in that production area.</P>
                <P>(6) You may not weld while you drill, complete, workover, or conduct wireline operations unless:</P>
                <P>(i) The fluids in the well (being drilled, completed, worked over, or having wireline operations conducted) are noncombustible; and</P>
                <P>(ii) You have precluded the entry of formation hydrocarbons into the wellbore by either mechanical means or a positive overbalance toward the formation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I name facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico Region?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Assign each facility a letter designation except for those types of facilities identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, A, B, CA, or CB.</P>

                <P>(1) After a facility is installed, rename each predrilled well that was assigned only a number and was suspended temporarily at the mudline or at the surface. Use a letter and number designation. The letter used must be the same as that of the production facility, and the number used must correspond to the order in which the well was completed, not necessarily the number assigned when it was drilled. <PRTPAGE P="68"/>For example, the first well completed for production on Facility A would be renamed Well A-1, the second would be Well A-2, and so on; and</P>
                <P>(2) When you have more than one facility on a block, each facility installed, and not bridge-connected to another facility, must be named using a different letter in sequential order. For example, EC 222A, EC 222B, EC 222C.</P>
                <P>(3) When you have more than one facility on multiple blocks in a local area being co-developed, each facility installed and not connected with a walkway to another facility should be named using a different letter in sequential order with the block number corresponding to the block on which the platform is located. For example, EC 221A, EC 222B, and EC 223C.</P>
                <P>(b) In naming multiple well caissons, you must assign a letter designation.</P>
                <P>(c) In naming single well caissons, you must use certain criteria as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For single well caissons not attached to a facility with a walkway, use the well designation. For example, Well No. 1;</P>
                <P>(2) For single well caissons attached to a facility with a walkway, use the same designation as the facility. For example, rename Well No.10 as A-10; and</P>
                <P>(3) For single well caissons with production equipment, use a letter designation for the facility name and a letter plus number designation for the well. For example, the Well No. 1 caisson would be designated as Facility A, and the well would be Well A-1.</P>

                <P>(a) The BSEE is incorporating by reference the documents listed in paragraphs (e) through (k) of this section. Paragraphs (e) through (k) identify the publishing organization of the documents, the address and phone number where you may obtain these documents, and the documents incorporated by reference. The Director of the Federal Register has approved the incorporations by reference according to 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.</P>

                <P>(1) Incorporation by reference of a document is limited to the edition of the publication that is cited in this section. Future amendments or revisions of the document are not included. The BSEE will publish any changes to a document in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and amend this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The BSEE may make the rule amending the document effective without prior opportunity for public comment when BSEE determines:</P>
                <P>(i) That the revisions to a document result in safety improvements or represent new industry standard technology and do not impose undue costs on the affected parties; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The BSEE meets the requirements for making a rule immediately effective under 5 U.S.C. 553.</P>
                <P>(3) The effect of incorporation by reference of a document into the regulations in this part is that the incorporated document is a requirement. When a section in this part incorporates all of a document, you are responsible for complying with the provisions of that entire document, except to the extent that the section which incorporates the document by reference provides otherwise. When a section in this part incorporates part of a document, you are responsible for complying with that part of the document as provided in that section.</P>
                <P>(b) The BSEE incorporated each document or specific portion by reference in the sections noted. The entire document is incorporated by reference, unless the text of the corresponding sections in this part calls for compliance with specific portions of the listed documents. In each instance, the applicable document is the specific edition or specific edition and supplement or addendum cited in this section.</P>
                <P>(c) Under §§ 250.141 and 250.142, you may comply with a later edition of a specific document incorporated by reference, provided:</P>
                <P>(1) You show that complying with the later edition provides a degree of protection, safety, or performance equal to or better than would be achieved by compliance with the listed edition; and</P>
                <P>(2) You obtain the prior written approval for alternative compliance from the authorized BSEE official.</P>

                <P>(d) You may inspect these documents at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 45600 Woodland Rd, Sterling, VA 20166; phone: 1-844-259-4779; or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

                <P>(a) A DWOP is a plan that provides sufficient information for BSEE to review a deepwater development project, and any other project that uses non-conventional production or completion technology, from a total system approach. The DWOP does not replace, but supplements other submittals required by the regulations such as BOEM Exploration Plans, Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations Coordination Documents. BSEE will use the information in your DWOP to determine whether the project will be developed in an acceptable manner, particularly with respect to operational safety and environmental protection issues involved with non-conventional production or completion technology.</P>
                <P>(b) The DWOP process consists of two parts: a Conceptual Plan and the DWOP. Section 250.289 prescribes what the Conceptual Plan must contain, and § 250.292 prescribes what the DWOP must contain.</P>

                <P>You must submit a DWOP for each development project in which you will use non-conventional production or completion technology, regardless of water depth. If you are unsure whether BSEE considers the technology of your project non-conventional, you must contact the Regional Supervisor for guidance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Pollution prevention.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) During the exploration, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas or sulphur, the lessee shall take measures to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of the ocean.</P>

              <P>(1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the satisfaction of the District Manager shall be at the expense of the lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to modification when directed by the District Manager.<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, State, and local governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any responsibility provided for by law.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The District Manager may restrict the rate of drilling fluid discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The District Manager may also restrict the use of components that could cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling mud system without prior approval of the District Manager. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all petroleum-based mud to prevent its discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all water-based mud from operations after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent its discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;</P>
              <P>(ii) The extent to which discharged mud may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The extent to which discharged mud may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.</P>
              <P>(2) You must obtain approval from the District Manager of the method you plan to use to dispose of drill cuttings, sand, and other well solids. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all cuttings from operations that utilize petroleum-based mud to prevent their discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all cuttings from operations that utilize water-based mud after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent their discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;</P>
              <P>(ii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.</P>
              <P>(3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken immediately.</P>
              <P>(4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or repaired.</P>

              <P>(5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other materials into offshore waters is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or configuration that they are likely to snag or damage fishing devices shall be handled and marked as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) All loose material, small tools, and other small objects shall be kept in a suitable storage area or a marked container when not in use and in a marked container before transport over offshore waters;</P>
              <P>(2) All cable, chain, or wire segments shall be recovered after use and securely stored until suitable disposal is accomplished;</P>
              <P>(3) Skid-mounted equipment, portable containers, spools or reels, and drums shall be marked with the owner's name prior to use or transport over offshore waters; and</P>
              <P>(4) All markings must clearly identify the owner and must be durable enough to resist the effects of the environmental conditions to which they may be exposed.</P>
              <P>(d) Any of the items described in paragraph (c) of this section that are lost overboard shall be recorded on the facility's daily operations report, as appropriate, and reported to the District Manager.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Casing and cementing program requirements.</E> Your casing and cementing programs must:</P>
                <P>(1) Properly control formation pressures and fluids;</P>
                <P>(2) Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore into offshore waters;</P>

                <P>(7)(i) Include a certification signed by a registered professional engineer that the casing and cementing design is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended under expected wellbore conditions, and is sufficient to satisfy the tests and requirements of this section and § 250.423. Submit this certification with your APD (Form BSEE-0123).<PRTPAGE P="105"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) You must have the registered professional engineer involved in the casing and cementing design process.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Casing requirements.</E> (1) You must design casing (including liners) to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof.</P>
                <P>(2) The casing design must include safety measures that ensure well control during drilling and safe operations during the life of the well.</P>
                <P>(3) On all wells that use subsea BOP stacks, you must include two independent barriers, including one mechanical barrier, in each annular flow path (examples of barriers include, but are not limited to, primary cement job and seal assembly). For the final casing string (or liner if it is your final string), you must install one mechanical barrier in addition to cement to prevent flow in the event of a failure in the cement. A dual float valve, by itself, is not considered a mechanical barrier. These barriers cannot be modified prior to or during completion or abandonment operations. The BSEE District Manager may approve alternative options under § 250.141. You must submit documentation of this installation to BSEE in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).</P>
                <P>(4) If you need to substitute a different size, grade, or weight of casing than what was approved in your APD, you must contact the District Manager for approval prior to installing the casing.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Cementing requirements</E>. (1) You must design and conduct your cementing jobs so that cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting times ensure that the cement placed behind the bottom 500 feet of casing attains a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling out the casing or before commencing completion operations. (If a liner is used refer to § 250.421(f)).</P>
                <P>(2) You must use a weighted fluid during displacement to maintain an overbalanced hydrostatic pressure during the cement setting time, except when cementing casings or liners in riserless hole sections.</P>

                <P>(a) After cementing surface, intermediate, or production casing (or liners), you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 12 hours. For conductor casing, you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 8 hours. One acceptable method of holding cement under pressure is to use float valves to hold the cement in place.</P>
                <P>(b) If you plan to nipple down your diverter or BOP stack during the 8- or 12-hour waiting time, you must determine, before nippling down, when it will be safe to do so. You must base your determination on a knowledge of formation conditions, cement composition, effects of nippling down, presence of potential drilling hazards, well conditions during drilling, cementing, and post cementing, as well as past experience.</P>

                <SUBJECT>When must I install a diverter system?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must install a diverter system before you drill a conductor or surface hole. The diverter system consists of a diverter sealing element, diverter lines, and control systems. You must design, install, use, maintain, and test the diverter system to ensure proper diversion of gases, water, drilling fluid, and other materials away from facilities and personnel.</P>

                <P>You must design and implement your drilling fluid program to prevent the loss of well control. This program must address drilling fluid safe practices, testing and monitoring equipment, drilling fluid quantities, and drilling fluid-handling areas.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What safe practices must the drilling fluid program follow?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Your drilling fluid program must include the following safe practices:</P>
                <P>(a) Before starting out of the hole with drill pipe, you must properly condition the drilling fluid. You must circulate a volume of drilling fluid equal to the annular volume with the drill pipe just off-bottom. You may omit this practice if documentation in the driller's report shows:</P>
                <P>(1) No indication of formation fluid influx before starting to pull the drill pipe from the hole;</P>
                <P>(2) The weight of returning drilling fluid is within 0.2 pounds per gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot) of the drilling fluid entering the hole; and</P>
                <P>(3) Other drilling fluid properties are within the limits established by the program approved in the APD.</P>
                <P>(b) Record each time you circulate drilling fluid in the hole in the driller's report;</P>
                <P>(c) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, you must fill the annulus with drilling fluid before the hydrostatic pressure decreases by 75 psi, or every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower decrease in hydrostatic pressure. You must calculate the number of stands of drill pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must fill the hole. You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid volume needed to fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near the driller's station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device to measure the drilling fluid required to fill the hole;</P>
                <P>(d) You must run and pull drill pipe and downhole tools at controlled rates so you do not swab or surge the well;</P>
                <P>(e) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation fluids, you must take appropriate measures to control the well. You must circulate and condition the well, on or near-bottom, unless well or drilling-fluid conditions prevent running the drill pipe back to the bottom;</P>
                <P>(f) You must calculate and post near the driller's console the maximum pressures that you may safely contain under a shut-in BOP for each casing string. The pressures posted must consider the surface pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or casing test as approved by the District Manager). As a minimum, you must post the following two pressures:</P>
                <P>(1) The surface pressure at which the shoe would break down. This calculation must consider the current drilling fluid weight in the hole; and</P>
                <P>(2) The lesser of the BOP's rated working pressure or 70 percent of casing-burst pressure (or casing test otherwise approved by the District Manager);</P>
                <P>(g) You must install an operable drilling fluid-gas separator and degasser before you begin drilling operations. You must maintain this equipment throughout the drilling of the well;</P>
                <P>(h) Before pulling drill-stem test tools from the hole, you must circulate or reverse-circulate the test fluids in the hole. If circulating out test fluids is not feasible, you may bullhead test fluids out of the drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate kill weight fluid;</P>
                <P>(i) When circulating, you must test the drilling fluid at least once each tour, or more frequently if conditions warrant. Your tests must conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other tests the District Manager requires for monitoring and maintaining drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and for kick detection. You must record the results of these tests in the drilling fluid report; and</P>
                <P>(j) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones are present or may be present, you must control drilling fluid temperatures to drill safely through those zones.</P>

                <P>(c) Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and</P>
                <P>(d) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging compartment, you must continually man the equipment and have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the safety requirements for drilling fluid-handling areas?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must classify drilling fluid-handling areas according to API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class 1, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). In areas where dangerous concentrations of combustible gas may accumulate, you must install and maintain a ventilation system and gas monitors. Drilling fluid-handling areas must have the following safety equipment:</P>
                <P>(a) A ventilation system capable of replacing the air once every 5 minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of air-volume flow per minute, per square foot of area, whichever is greater. In addition:</P>
                <P>(1) If natural means provide adequate ventilation, then a mechanical ventilation system is not necessary;</P>
                <P>(2) If a mechanical system does not run continuously, then it must activate when gas detectors indicate the presence of 1 percent or more of combustible gas by volume; and</P>
                <P>(3) If discharges from a mechanical ventilation system may be hazardous, then you must maintain the drilling fluid-handling area at a negative pressure. You must protect the negative pressure area by using at least one of the following: a pressure-sensitive alarm, open-door alarms on each access to the area, automatic door-closing devices, air locks, or other devices approved by the District Manager;</P>
                <P>(b) Gas detectors and alarms except in open areas where adequate ventilation is provided by natural means. You must test and recalibrate gas detectors quarterly. No more than 90 days may elapse between tests;</P>
                <P>(c) Explosion-proof or pressurized electrical equipment to prevent the ignition of explosive gases. Where you use air for pressuring equipment, you must locate the air intake outside of and as far as practicable from hazardous areas; and</P>
                <P>(d) Alarms that activate when the mechanical ventilation system fails.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the source control, containment, and collocated equipment requirements?</SUBJECT>

                <P>For drilling operations using a subsea BOP or surface BOP on a floating facility, you must have the ability <PRTPAGE P="115"/>to control or contain a blowout event at the sea floor.</P>
                <P>(a) To determine your required source control and containment capabilities you must do the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Consider a scenario of the wellbore fully evacuated to reservoir fluids, with no restrictions in the well.</P>
                <P>(2) Evaluate the performance of the well as designed to determine if a full shut-in can be achieved without having reservoir fluids broach to the sea floor. If your evaluation indicates that the well can only be partially shut-in, then you must determine your ability to flow and capture the residual fluids to a surface production and storage system.</P>
                <P>(b) You must have access to and the ability to deploy Source Control and Containment Equipment (SCCE) and all other necessary supporting and collocated equipment to regain control of the well. SCCE means the capping stack, cap-and-flow system, containment dome, and/or other subsea and surface devices, equipment, and vessels, which have the collective purpose to control a spill source and stop the flow of fluids into the environment or to contain fluids escaping into the environment. This SCCE, supporting equipment, and collocated equipment must include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Subsea containment and capture equipment, including containment domes and capping stacks;</P>
                <P>(2) Subsea utility equipment including hydraulic power sources and hydrate control equipment;</P>
                <P>(3) Collocated equipment including dispersant injection equipment;</P>
                <P>(4) Riser systems;</P>
                <P>(5) Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs);</P>
                <P>(6) Capture vessels;</P>
                <P>(7) Support vessels; and</P>
                <P>(8) Storage facilities.</P>
                <P>(c) You must submit a description of your source control and containment capabilities to the Regional Supervisor and receive approval before BSEE will approve your APD, Form BSEE-0123. The description of your containment capabilities must contain the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Your source control and containment capabilities for controlling and containing a blowout event at the seafloor;</P>
                <P>(2) A discussion of the determination required in paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(3) Information showing that you have access to and the ability to deploy all equipment required by paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) You must contact the District Manager and Regional Supervisor for reevaluation of your source control and containment capabilities if your:</P>
                <P>(1) Well design changes; or</P>
                <P>(2) Approved source control and containment equipment is out of service.</P>
                <P>(e) You must maintain, test, and inspect the source control, containment, and collocated equipment identified in the following table according to these requirements:</P>

                <P>(a) Whenever you interrupt operations, you must notify the District Manager. Before moving off the well, you must have two independent barriers installed, at least one of which must be a mechanical barrier, as approved by the District Manager. You must install the barriers at appropriate depths within a properly cemented casing string or liner. Before removing a subsea BOP stack or surface BOP stack on a mudline suspension well, you must conduct a negative pressure test in accordance with § 250.721.</P>
                <P>(1) The events that would cause you to interrupt operations and notify the District Manager include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Evacuation of the rig crew;</P>
                <P>(ii) Inability to keep the rig on location;</P>

                <P>(iv) Observed flow outside the well's casing (e.g., shallow water flow or bubbling).</P>
                <P>(2) The District Manager may approve alternate procedures or barriers, in accordance with § 250.141, if you do not have time to install the required barriers or if special circumstances occur.</P>
                <P>(b) Before you displace kill-weight fluid from the wellbore and/or riser, thereby creating an underbalanced state, you must obtain approval from the District Manager. To obtain approval, you must submit with your APD or APM your reasons for displacing the kill-weight fluid and provide detailed step-by-step written procedures describing how you will safely displace these fluids. The step-by-step displacement procedures must address the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Number and type of independent barriers, as described in § 250.420(b)(3), that are in place for each flow path that requires such barriers;</P>
                <P>(2) Tests you will conduct to ensure integrity of independent barriers;</P>
                <P>(3) BOP procedures you will use while displacing kill-weight fluids; and</P>
                <P>(4) Procedures you will use to monitor the volumes and rates of fluids entering and leaving the wellbore.</P>
                <P>(c) For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, in addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:</P>

                <P>(1) If you move your drilling rig off a well prior to completion or permanent abandonment, you must ensure that <PRTPAGE P="145"/>any equipment left on, near, or in a wellbore that has penetrated below the surface casing is positioned in a manner to:</P>
                <P>(i) Protect the well head; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Prevent or minimize the likelihood of compromising the down-hole integrity of the well or the effectiveness of the well plugs.</P>
                <P>(2) In areas of ice scour you must use a well mudline cellar or an equivalent means of minimizing the risk of damage to the well head and wellbore. BSEE may approve an equivalent means that will meet or exceed the level of safety and environmental protection provided by a mudline cellar if the operator can show that utilizing a mudline cellar would compromise the stability of the rig, impede access to the well head during a well control event, or otherwise create operational risks.</P>

                <P>(v) ANSI/API Spec. 17D.</P>
                <P>(3) For surface and subsea BOPs, the pipe and variable bore rams installed in the BOP stack must be capable of effectively closing and sealing on the tubular body of any drill pipe, workstring, and tubing (excluding tubing with exterior control lines and flat packs) in the hole under MASP, as defined for the operation, with the proposed regulator settings of the BOP control system.</P>
                <P>(4) The current set of approved schematic drawings must be available on the rig and at an onshore location. If you make any modifications to the BOP or control system that will change your BSEE-approved schematic drawings, you must suspend operations until you obtain approval from the District Manager.</P>
                <P>(b) You must ensure that the design, fabrication, maintenance, and repair of your BOP system is in accordance with the requirements contained in this part, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) recommendations unless otherwise directed by BSEE, and recognized engineering practices. The training and qualification of repair and maintenance personnel must meet or exceed any OEM training recommendations unless otherwise directed by BSEE.</P>
                <P>(c) You must follow the failure reporting procedures contained in API Standard 53, ANSI/API Spec. 6A, and ANSI/API Spec 16A (all incorporated by reference in § 250.198), and:</P>
                <P>(1) You must provide a written notice of equipment failure to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs, and the manufacturer of such equipment within 30 days after the discovery and identification of the failure. A failure is any condition that prevents the equipment from meeting the functional specification.</P>

                <P>(2) You must ensure that an investigation and a failure analysis are performed within 120 days of the failure to <PRTPAGE P="150"/>determine the cause of the failure. You must also ensure that the results and any corrective action are documented. If the investigation and analysis are performed by an entity other than the manufacturer, you must ensure that the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs and the manufacturer receive a copy of the analysis report.</P>
                <P>(3) If the equipment manufacturer notifies you that it has changed the design of the equipment that failed or if you have changed operating or repair procedures as a result of a failure, then you must, within 30 days of such changes, report the design change or modified procedures in writing to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs.</P>
                <P>(4) You must send the reports required in this paragraph to: Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.</P>
                <P>(d) If you plan to use a BOP stack manufactured after the effective date of this regulation, you must use one manufactured pursuant to an API Spec. Q1 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198) quality management system. Such quality management system must be certified by an entity that meets the requirements of ISO 17011.</P>

                <P>For any operation that requires the use of a BOP, you must include the information listed in this section with your applicable APD, APM, or other submittal. You are required to submit this information only once for each well, unless the information changes from what you provided in an earlier approved submission or you have moved off location from the well. After you have submitted this information for a particular well, subsequent APMs or other submittals for the well should reference the approved submittal containing the information required by this section and confirm that the information remains accurate and that you have not moved off location from that well. If the information changes or you have moved off location from the well, you must submit updated information in your next submission.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for a surface BOP stack?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When you drill or conduct operations with a surface BOP stack, you must install the BOP system before drilling or conducting operations to deepen the well below the surface casing and after the well is deepened below the surface casing point. The surface BOP stack must include at least four remote-controlled, hydraulically operated BOPs, consisting of one annular BOP, one BOP equipped with blind shear rams, and two BOPs equipped with pipe rams.</P>
                <P>(1) The blind shear rams must be capable of shearing at any point along the tubular body of any drill pipe (excluding tool joints, bottom-hole tools, and bottom hole assemblies that include heavy-weight pipe or collars), workstring, tubing provided that the capability to shear tubing with exterior control lines is not required prior to April 30, 2018, and any electric-, wire-, and slick-line that is in the hole and sealing the wellbore after shearing. If your blind shear rams are unable to cut any electric-, wire-, or slick-line under MASP as defined for the operation and seal the wellbore, you must use an alternative cutting device capable of shearing the lines before closing the BOP. This device must be available on the rig floor during operations that require their use.</P>
                <P>(2) The two BOPs equipped with pipe rams must be capable of closing and sealing on the tubular body of any drill pipe, workstring, and tubing under MASP, as defined for the operation, except for tubing with exterior control lines and flat packs, a bottom hole assembly that includes heavy-weight pipe or collars, and bottom-hole tools.</P>
                <P>(b) If you plan to use a surface BOP on a floating production facility you must:</P>
                <P>(1) For BOPs installed after April 29, 2019, follow the BOP requirements in § 250.734(a)(1).</P>
                <P>(2) For risers installed after July 28, 2016, use a dual bore riser configuration before drilling or operating in any hole section or interval where hydrocarbons are, or may be, exposed to the well. The dual bore riser must meet the design requirements of API RP 2RD (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), including appropriate design for the maximum anticipated operating and environmental conditions.</P>
                <P>(i) For a dual bore riser configuration, the annulus between the risers must be monitored for pressure during operations. You must describe in your APD or APM your annulus monitoring plan and how you will secure the well in the event a leak is detected.</P>
                <P>(ii) The inner riser for a dual riser configuration is subject to the requirements at § 250.721 for testing the casing or liner.</P>

                <P>(c) You must install separate side outlets on the BOP stack for the kill and choke lines. If your stack does not have side outlets, you must install a drilling spool with side outlets. The outlet valves must hold pressure from both directions.<PRTPAGE P="157"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) You must install a choke and a kill line on the BOP stack. You must equip each line with two full-bore, full-opening valves, one of which must be remote-controlled. On the kill line, you may install a check valve and a manual valve instead of the remote-controlled valve. To use this configuration, both manual valves must be readily accessible and you must install the check valve between the manual valves and the pump.</P>

                <P>Your BOP system (this includes the choke manifold, kelly-type valves, inside BOP, and drill string safety valve) must meet the following testing requirements:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Pressure test frequency.</E> You must pressure test your BOP system:</P>
                <P>(1) When installed;</P>
                <P>(2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test, or 30 days since your last blind shear ram BOP pressure test. You must begin to test your BOP system before midnight on the 14th day (or 30th day for your blind shear rams) following the conclusion of the previous test;</P>
                <P>(3) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. You may omit this pressure test requirement if you did not remove the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner, the required BOP test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than the test pressures for the previous BOP test, and the time elapsed between tests has not exceeded 14 days (or 30 days for blind shear rams). You must indicate in your APD which casing strings and liners meet these criteria;</P>
                <P>(4) The District Manager may require more frequent testing if conditions or your BOP performance warrant.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Pressure test procedures.</E> When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each BOP component. You must begin each test by conducting the low-pressure test then transition to the high-pressure test. Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. The table in this paragraph (b) outlines your pressure test requirements.</P>

                      <P>(4) In lieu of meeting the schedule established in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you may request that BSEE approve a 21-day BOP testing frequency. To obtain BSEE approval, you must submit a request to the appropriate BSEE Regional Supervisor, District Field Operations. Your request must demonstrate that you have developed a BOP health monitoring plan that includes certain system capabilities. As long as your plan is consistent with recognized engineering and industry practice, BSEE will approve your request if it includes the following:</P>

                      <P>(i) Condition monitoring tools, including continuous surveillance of sensor readings <PRTPAGE P="165"/>from the BOP control system, real-time condition analysis and displays, functional pressure signal analysis, historical sensor data;</P>

                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Pressure test procedures.</E> When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each BOP component (excluding test rams and non-sealing shear rams). You must begin each test by conducting the low-pressure test then transition to the high-pressure test. Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. The table in this paragraph (b) outlines your pressure test requirements.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the BOP maintenance and inspection requirements?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) You must maintain and inspect your BOP system to ensure that the equipment functions as designed. The BOP maintenance and inspections must meet or exceed any OEM recommendations, recognized engineering practices, and industry standards incorporated by reference into the regulations of this subpart, including API Standard 53 (incorporated by reference in § 250.198). You must document how you met or exceeded the provisions of API Standard 53, maintain complete records to ensure the traceability of BOP stack equipment beginning at fabrication, and record the results of your <PRTPAGE P="169"/>BOP inspections and maintenance actions. You must make all records available to BSEE upon request.</P>
                <P>(b) A complete breakdown and detailed physical inspection of the BOP and every associated system and component must be performed every 5 years. This complete breakdown and inspection may be performed in phased intervals. You must track and document all system and component inspection dates. These records must be available on the rig. A BAVO is required to be present during each inspection and must compile a detailed report documenting the inspection, including descriptions of any problems and how they were corrected. You must make these reports available to BSEE upon request. This complete breakdown and inspection must be performed every 5 years from the following applicable dates, whichever is later:</P>
                <P>(1) The date the equipment owner accepts delivery of a new build drilling rig with a new BOP system;</P>
                <P>(2) The date the new, repaired, or remanufactured equipment is initially installed into the system; or</P>
                <P>(3) The date of the last 5 year inspection for the component.</P>
                <P>(c) You must visually inspect your surface BOP system on a daily basis. You must visually inspect your subsea BOP system, marine riser, and wellhead at least once every 3 days if weather and sea conditions permit. You may use cameras to inspect subsea equipment.</P>
                <P>(d) You must ensure that all personnel maintaining, inspecting, or repairing BOPs, or critical components of the BOP system, are trained in accordance with applicable training requirements in subpart S of this part, any applicable OEM criteria, recognized engineering practices, and industry standards incorporated by reference in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(e) You must make all records available to BSEE upon request. You must ensure that the rig unit owner maintains the BOP maintenance, inspection, and repair records on the rig unit for 2 years from the date the records are created or for a longer period if directed by BSEE. You must ensure that all equipment schematics, maintenance, inspection, and repair records are located at an onshore location for the service life of the equipment.</P>

                <P>(a) For operations in the BSEE Gulf of Mexico (GOM) OCS Region, you must submit Form BSEE-0133, Well Activity Report (WAR), to the District Manager on a weekly basis. The reporting week is defined as beginning on Sunday (12 a.m.) and ending on the following Saturday (11:59 p.m.). This reporting week corresponds to a week (Sunday through Saturday) on a standard calendar. Report any well operations that extend past the end of this weekly reporting period on the next weekly report. The reporting period for the weekly report is never longer than 7 days, but could be less than 7 days for the first reporting period and the last reporting period for a particular well operation. Submit each WAR and accompanying Form BSEE-0133S, Open Hole Data Report, to the BSEE GOM OCS Region no later than close of business on the Friday immediately after the closure of the reporting week. The District Manager may require more frequent submittal of the WAR on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>(b) For operations in the Pacific or Alaska OCS Regions, you must submit Form BSEE-0133, WAR, to the District Manager on a daily basis.</P>

                <P>(c) The WAR must include a description of the operations conducted, any abnormal or significant events that affect the permitted operation each day within the report from the time you begin operations to the time you end operations, any verbal approval received, the well's as-built drawings, casing, fluid weights, shoe tests, test pressures at surface conditions, and any other information concerning well activities required by the District Manager. For casing cementing operations, indicate type of returns (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, full, partial, or none). If partial or no returns are observed, you must indicate how you determined the top of cement. For each report, indicate the operation status for the well at the end of the reporting period. On the final WAR, indicate the status of the well (completed, temporarily abandoned, permanently abandoned, or drilling suspended) and the date you finished such operations.</P>

You may take only the minimum number of safety devices out of service. Personnel must monitor the bypassed or blocked-out functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any surface or subsurface safety device which is temporarily out of service must be flagged. A designated visual indicator must be used to identify the bypassed safety device. You must follow the monitoring procedures as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) If you are using a non-computer-based system, meaning your safety system operates primarily with pneumatic supply or non-programmable electrical systems, you must monitor bypassed safety devices by positioning monitoring personnel at either the control <PRTPAGE P="198"/>panel for the bypassed safety device, or at the bypassed safety device, or at the component that the bypassed safety device would be monitoring when in service. You must also ensure that monitoring personnel are able to view all relevant essential operating conditions until all bypassed safety devices are placed back in service and are able to initiate shut-in action in the event of an abnormal condition.</P>

                <P>(a) You may apply industry standard Class B, Class C, or Class B/C logic to applicable PSL sensors installed on process equipment. If the device may be bypassed for greater than 45 seconds, you must monitor the bypassed devices in accordance with § 250.869(a). You must document on your field test records any use of a PSL sensor with a time delay greater than 45 seconds. For purposes of this section, PSL sensors are categorized as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Class B safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed for a fixed time period (typically less than 15 seconds, but not more than 45 seconds). Examples include sensors used in conjunction with the design of pump and compressor panels such as PSL sensors, lubricator no-flows, and high-water jacket temperature shutdowns.</P>

                <P>(2) Class C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed until the component comes into full service (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the time at which the startup pressure equals or exceeds the set pressure of the PSL sensor, the system reaches a stabilized pressure, and the PSL sensor clears). If a Class C safety device is bypassed, you must monitor the device until it is in full service.</P>
                <P>(3) Class B/C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to incorporate a combination of Class B and Class C circuitry. These devices are used to ensure that the PSL sensors are not unnecessarily bypassed during startup and idle operations, (e.g., Class B/C bypass circuitry activates when a pump is shut down during normal operations). The PSL sensor remains bypassed until the pump's start circuitry is activated and either:</P>
                <P>(i) The Class B timer expires no later than 45 seconds from start activation, or</P>
                <P>(ii) The Class C bypass is initiated until the pump builds up pressure above the PSL sensor set point and the PSL sensor comes into full service.</P>
                <P>(b) If you do not install time delay circuitry that bypasses activation of PSL sensor shutdown logic for a specified time period on process and product transport equipment during startup and idle operations, you must manually bypass (pin out or disengage) the PSL sensor, with a time delay not to exceed 45 seconds.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the BSEE requirements for assessment of fixed platforms?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You must document all wells, equipment, and pipelines supported by the platform if you intend to use either the A-2 or A-3 assessment category. Assessment categories are defined in API RP 2A-WSD, Section 17.3 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). If BSEE objects to the assessment category you used for your assessment, you may need to redesign and/or modify the platform to adequately demonstrate that the platform is able to withstand the environmental loadings for the appropriate assessment category.</P>
                <P>(b) You must perform an analysis check when your platform will have additional personnel, additional topside facilities, increased environmental or operational loading, inadequate deck height, or suffered significant damage (e.g., experienced damage to primary structural members or conductor guide trays or global structural integrity is adversely affected); or the exposure category changes to a more restrictive level (see Sections 17.2.1 through 17.2.5 of API RP 2A-WSD, incorporated by reference in § 250.198, for a description of assessment initiators).</P>
                <P>(c) You must initiate mitigation actions for platforms that do not pass the assessment process of API RP 2A-WSD. You must submit applications for your mitigation actions (e.g., repair, modification, decommissioning) to the Regional Supervisor for approval before you conduct the work.</P>
                <P>(d) The BSEE may require you to conduct a platform design basis check when the reduced environmental loading criteria contained in API RP 2A-WSD Section 17.6 are not applicable.</P>
                <P>(e) By November 1, 2009, you must submit a complete list of all the platforms you operate, together with all the appropriate data to support the assessment category you assign to each platform and the platform assessment initiators (as defined in API RP 2A-WSD) to the Regional Supervisor. You must submit subsequent complete lists and the appropriate data to support the consequence-of-failure category every 5 years thereafter, or as directed by the Regional Supervisor.</P>
                <P>(f) The use of Section 17, Assessment of Existing Platforms, of API RP 2A-WSD is limited to existing fixed structures that are serving their original approved purpose. You must obtain approval from the Regional Supervisor for any change in purpose of the platform, following the provisions of API RP 2A-WSD, Section 15, Re-use.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Granting pipeline rights-of-way.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In considering an application for a right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the potential effect of the associated pipeline on the human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), property, and mineral resources in the entire area during construction and operational phases. The Regional Supervisor shall prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines. To aid in the evaluation and determinations, the Regional Supervisor may request and consider views and recommendations of appropriate Federal Agencies, hold public meetings after appropriate notice, and consult, as appropriate, with State agencies, organizations, industries, and individuals. Before granting a pipeline right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall give consideration to any recommendation by the intergovernmental planning program, or similar process, for the assessment and management of OCS oil and gas transportation.</P>
              <P>(b) Should the proposed route of a right-of-way adjoin and subsequently cross any State submerged lands, the applicant shall submit evidence to the Regional Supervisor that the State(s) so affected has reviewed the application. The applicant shall also submit any comment received as a result of that review. In the event of a State recommendation to relocate the proposed route, the Regional Supervisor may consult with the appropriate State officials.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The applicant shall submit photocopies of return receipts to the Regional Supervisor that indicate the date that each lessee or right-of-way holder referenced in § 250.1015(c) of this part has received a copy of the application. Letters of no objection may be submitted in lieu of the return receipts.</P>
              <P>(2) The Regional Supervisor shall not take final action on a right-of-way application until the Regional Supervisor is satisfied that each such lessee or right-of-way holder has been afforded at least 30 days from the date determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which to submit comments.</P>
              <P>(d) If a proposed right-of-way crosses any lands not subject to disposition by mineral leasing or restricted from oil and gas activities, it shall be rejected by the Regional Supervisor unless the Federal Agency with jurisdiction over such excluded or restricted area gives its consent to the granting of the right-of-way. In such case, the applicant, upon a request filed within 30 days after receipt of the notification of such rejection, shall be allowed an opportunity to eliminate the conflict.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If the application and other required information are found to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the right-of-way may be granted. The Regional Supervisor may prescribe, as conditions to the right-of-way grant, stipulations necessary to protect human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), property, and mineral resources located on or adjacent to the right-of-way.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a change in the application should be made, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the applicant that an amended application shall be filed subject to stipulated changes. The Regional Supervisor shall determine whether the applicant shall deliver copies of the amended application to other parties for comment.</P>
              <P>(3) A decision to reject an application shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the rejection.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the right-of-way as granted.</P>
              <P>(2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-way grants in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the date of the acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of pipeline construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with evidence of such notification; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.</P>
              <P>(3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed from the proposed right-of-way as granted may be grounds for forfeiture of the right-of-way.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.</P>

              <P>This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose of joint development and unitization is to:</P>
              <P>(a) Conserve natural resources;</P>
              <P>(b) Prevent waste; and/or</P>
              <P>(c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 250.1301</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for unitization?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary unitization.</E> You and other OCS lessees may ask the Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if unitized operations:</P>
              <P>(1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or</P>
              <P>(2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compulsory unitization.</E> The Regional Supervisor may require you and other lessees to unitize operations of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir if unitized operations are necessary to:</P>
              <P>(1) Prevent waste;</P>
              <P>(2) Conserve natural resources; or</P>
              <P>(3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unit area.</E> The area that a unit includes is the minimum number of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations common to two or more leases. A unit may include whole leases or portions of leases.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit agreement.</E> You, the other lessees, and the unit operator must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations (§ 250.180) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor orders or approves a suspension of production under § 250.170.<PRTPAGE P="256"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Unit operating agreement.</E> The unit operator and the owners of working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to approve the unit operating agreement.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Extension of a lease covered by unit operations.</E> If your unit agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease expires unless:</P>
              <P>(1) Its initial term has not expired;</P>
              <P>(2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or</P>
              <P>(3) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of production or operations for your lease.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Unit operations.</E> If your lease, or any part of your lease, is subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your lease remains part of the unit area, and as long as operations continue the unit in effect.</P>
              <P>(1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any extension under § 250.180, the unit operator must request and obtain BSEE approval of a suspension of production under § 250.170 in order to keep the unit from terminating.</P>
              <P>(2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:</P>
              <P>(i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or</P>
              <P>(ii) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of operations under § 250.170.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program submitted to BSEE or a unitization agreement. A competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and which is shut in at the well head or at the surface but not necessarily connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans future production.</P>
              <P>(b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.</P>

              <P>(c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir determined competitive by the BSEE Regional Supervisor, you and the other affected lessees must submit for approval a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program. You must submit the joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program within 90 days after the Regional Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is competitive. The joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program must <PRTPAGE P="257"/>provide for the development and/or production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental Competitive Reservoir Development Programs for the Regional Supervisor's approval.</P>
              <P>(d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement on a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program, submitted to BSEE within the approved period of time, each lessee must submit a separate Competitive Reservoir Development Program to the Regional Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve differences in the separate Competitive Reservoir Development Programs. If the differences in the separate programs are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization is necessary under § 250.1301(b), BSEE will initiate unitization under § 250.1304.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How do I apply for voluntary unitization?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You must file a request for a voluntary unit with the Regional Supervisor. Your request must include:</P>
              <P>(1) A draft of the proposed unit agreement;</P>
              <P>(2) A proposed initial plan of operation;</P>
              <P>(3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and</P>
              <P>(4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the unitization proposal meets the criteria of § 250.1300.</P>

              <P>(b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this part. BSEE will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to follow. If BSEE revises the model, BSEE will publish the revised model in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If you vary your unit agreement from the model agreement, you must obtain the approval of the Regional Supervisor.</P>
              <P>(c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.</P>
              <P>(d) You must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 of this part with your request for a voluntary unitization proposal or the expansion of a previously approved voluntary unit to include additional acreage. Additionally, you must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 with your request for unitization revision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will BSEE require unitization?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require unitization.</P>
              <P>(b) If you ask BSEE to require unitization, you must file a request with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement as described in §§ 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of § 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting lessees copies of:</P>
              <P>(1) The request;</P>
              <P>(2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;</P>
              <P>(3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and</P>
              <P>(4) The proposed initial plan of operation.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, BSEE will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed unitization.</P>

              <P>(d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until BSEE provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an opportunity for a hearing. If you want BSEE to hold a hearing, you must request it <PRTPAGE P="258"/>within 30 days after you receive written notice from the Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for compulsory unitization from another lessee.</P>
              <P>(e) BSEE will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 30 days after BSEE provides written notice of the hearing date to all parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.</P>
              <P>(f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.</P>

                <P>(b) If you file an appeal, you must either:</P>
                <P>(1) Submit a surety bond in the amount of the penalty to the appropriate Leasing Office in the Region where the penalty was assessed, following instructions that the Reviewing Officer will include in the final decision; or</P>
                <P>(2) Notify the appropriate Leasing Office, in the Region where the penalty was assessed, that you want your lease-specific/area-wide bond on file to be used as the bond for the penalty amount.</P>

                <P>(c) If you choose the alternative in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the BOEM Regional Director may require additional security (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> security in excess of your existing bond) to ensure sufficient coverage during an appeal. In that event, the Regional Director will require you to post the supplemental bond with the regional office in the same manner as under 30 CFR 556.53(d) through (f). If the Regional Director determines the appeal should be covered by a lease-specific abandonment account then you must establish an account that meets the requirements of 30 CFR part 556.56.</P>
                <P>(d) If you do not either pay the penalty or file a timely appeal, BSEE will take one or more of the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) We will collect the amount you were assessed, plus interest, late payment charges, and other fees as provided by law, from the date you received the Reviewing Officer's final decision until the date we receive payment;</P>
                <P>(2) We may initiate additional enforcement, including, if appropriate, cancellation of the lease, right-of-way, license, permit, or approval, or the forfeiture of a bond under this part; or</P>
                <P>(3) We may bar you from doing further business with the Federal Government according to Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, 31 U.S.C. 6101.

              <SUBJECT>Well casing and cementing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the several casing strings in order of normal installation are:</P>
              <P>(i) Drive or structural,</P>
              <P>(ii) Conductor,</P>
              <P>(iii) Cap rock casing,</P>
              <P>(iv) Bobtail cap rock casing (required when the cap rock casing does not penetrate into the cap rock),</P>
              <P>(v) Second cap rock casing (brine wells), and</P>
              <P>(vi) Production liner.</P>
              <P>(2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).</P>
              <P>(3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and to assure safe operations for the life of the well.</P>
              <P>(4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing removal upon well abandonment if the District Manager determines that subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not jeopardized.</P>
              <P>(5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by pressure testing the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate cementing, the lessee shall initiate remedial action as approved by the District Manager. For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of cementing shall be the pressure testing of the annulus between the cap rock and the conductor casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent of the burst pressure of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the collapse pressure of the cap rock casing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Drive or structural casing.</E> This casing shall be set by driving, jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District Manager, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular space back to the mud line shall be used.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conductor and cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements.</E> (1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, subject to District Manager approval, to permit <PRTPAGE P="270"/>the casing to be set in a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to be isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the District Manager for approval.</P>
              <P>(2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line.

              <P>(a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, except the drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested. The conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not be subject to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in 30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run and the casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated until a satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, and results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the driller's report.</P>
              <P>(b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a time lapse of at least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.</P>

A wrench to fit the work-string safety valve must be readily available. Proper connections must be readily available for inserting valves in the work string. The full-opening safety valve is not required for coiled tubing or snubbing operations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Who must submit an oil spill response plan (OSRP)?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) If you are the owner or operator of an oil handling, storage, or transportation facility, and it is located seaward of the coast line, you must submit an oil spill response plan (OSRP) to BSEE for approval. Your OSRP must demonstrate that you can respond quickly and effectively whenever oil is discharged from your facility. Refer to § 254.6 for the definitions of <E T="03">oil, facility,</E> and <E T="03">coast line</E> if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.</P>
              <P>(b) You must maintain a current OSRP for an abandoned facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until the Chief, Oil Spill Preparedness Division (OSPD) notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer required.</P>
              <P>(c) Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan for a pipeline that carries:</P>
              <P>(1) Oil;</P>
              <P>(2) Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or</P>
              <P>(3) Gas and naturally occurring condensate.</P>
              <P>(d) If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Chief, OSPD.</P>
              <P>(e) If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it should be regulated by BSEE, you may contact the Chief, OSPD, offer to accept BSEE jurisdiction over your facility, and request that BSEE seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a relinquishment of that jurisdiction.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When must I submit an OSRP?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) You must submit, and BSEE must approve, an OSRP that covers each facility located seaward of the coast line before you may use that facility. To continue operations, you must operate <PRTPAGE P="321"/>the facility in compliance with the OSRP.</P>
              <P>(b) Despite the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you may operate your facility after you submit your OSRP while BSEE reviews it for approval. To operate a facility without an approved OSRP, you must certify in writing to the Chief, OSPD that you have the capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge. The certification must show that you have ensured by contract, or other means approved by the Chief, OSPD, the availability of private personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the discharge. Verification from the organization(s) providing the personnel and equipment must accompany the certification. BSEE will not allow you to operate a facility for more than 2 years without an approved OSRP.</P>

              <P>(a) Your OSRP may be for a single lease or facility or a group of leases or facilities. All the leases or facilities in your plan must have the same owner or operator (including affiliates) and must be located in the same BSEE Region (see definition of Regional OSRP in § 254.6).</P>
              <P>(b) Regional OSRPs must address all the elements required for an OSRP in subpart B, or subpart D of this part, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) When developing a Regional OSRP, you may group leases or facilities subject to the approval of the Chief, OSPD, for the purposes of:</P>
              <P>(1) Calculating response times;</P>
              <P>(2) Determining quantities of response equipment;</P>
              <P>(3) Conducting oil-spill trajectory analyses;</P>
              <P>(4) Determining worst case discharge scenarios; and</P>
              <P>(5) Identifying areas of special economic and environmental importance that may be impacted and the strategies for their protection.</P>
              <P>(d) The Chief, OSPD, may specify how to address the elements of a Regional OSRP. The Chief, OSPD, also may require that Regional OSRPs contain additional information if necessary for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.</P>

Examples of documents that you may reference are the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Area Contingency Plan (ACP), BSEE or BOEM environmental documents, and Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) documents that are readily accessible to the Chief, OSPD. You must ensure that the Chief, OSPD, possesses or is provided with copies of all OSRO documents you reference. You should contact the Chief, OSPD, if you want to know whether a reference is acceptable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General response plan requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The OSRP must provide for response to an oil spill from the facility. You must immediately carry out the provisions of the OSRP whenever there is a release of oil from the facility. You must also carry out the training, equipment testing, and periodic drills described in the OSRP, and these measures must be sufficient to ensure the safety of the facility and to mitigate or prevent a discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge.</P>
              <P>(b) The OSRP must be consistent with the National Contingency Plan and the appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).</P>
              <P>(c) Nothing in this part relieves you from taking all appropriate actions necessary to immediately abate the source of a spill and remove any spills of oil.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the requirements listed in this part, you must provide any other information the Chief, OSPD, requires for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) You are required by § 254.26(d)(1) to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of the response equipment identified in your OSRP that you would use to contain and recover your <PRTPAGE P="330"/>worst case discharge. You must calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of the equipment by multiplying the manufacturer's rated throughput capacity over a 24-hour period by 20 percent. This 20 percent efficiency factor takes into account the limitations of the recovery operations due to available daylight, sea state, temperature, viscosity, and emulsification of the oil being recovered. You must use this calculated rate to determine if you have sufficient recovery capacity to respond to your worst case discharge scenario.</P>
              <P>(b) If you want to use a different efficiency factor for specific oil recovery devices, you must submit evidence to substantiate that efficiency factor. Adequate evidence includes verified performance data measured during actual spills or test data gathered according to the provisions of § 254.45(b) and (c).</P>

              <P>You must calculate the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For an oil production platform facility, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the sum of the following:</P>

              <P>(1) The maximum capacity of all oil storage tanks and flow lines on the facility. Flow line volume may be estimated; and<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The volume of oil calculated to leak from a break in any pipelines connected to the facility considering shutdown time, the effect of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces and other factors; and</P>
              <P>(3) The daily production volume from an uncontrolled blowout of the highest capacity well associated with the facility. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must consider reservoir characteristics, casing/production tubing sizes, and historical production and reservoir pressure data. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by § 254.26(d)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) For exploratory or development drilling operations, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the daily volume possible from an uncontrolled blowout. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must consider any known reservoir characteristics. If reservoir characteristics are unknown, you must consider the characteristics of any analog reservoirs from the area and give an explanation for the selection of the reservoir(s) used. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by § 254.26(d)(1).</P>
              <P>(c) For a pipeline facility, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the volume possible from a pipeline break. You must calculate this volume as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Add the pipeline system leak detection time to the shutdown response time.</P>
              <P>(2) Multiply the time calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the highest measured oil flow rate over the preceding 12-month period. For new pipelines, you should use the predicted oil flow rate in the calculation.</P>
              <P>(3) Add to the volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the total volume of oil that would leak from the pipeline after it is shut in. Calculate this volume by taking into account the effects of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces, length of pipeline segment, tie-ins with other pipelines, and other factors.</P>
              <P>(d) If your facility which stores, handles, transfers, processes, or transports oil does not fall into the categories listed in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, contact the Chief, OSPD for instructions on the calculation of the volume of your worst case discharge scenario.</P>

              <P>(a) The Director may direct the suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other operation or activity on all or any part of a lease when it has been determined that such suspension or temporary prohibition is in the National interest to:</P>
              <P>(1) Facilitate proper development of a lease including a reasonable time to develop a mine and construct necessary support facilities, or</P>
              <P>(2) Allow for the construction or negotiation for use of transportation facilities.</P>
              <P>(b) The Director may also direct or, at the request of the lessee, approve a suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other operation or activity, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The lessee failed to comply with a provision of applicable law, regulation, order, or the lease;</P>
              <P>(2) There is a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposit, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;</P>
              <P>(3) The suspension or temporary prohibition is in the interest of National security or defense;</P>

              <P>(4) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary for the initiation <PRTPAGE P="344"/>and conduct of an environmental evaluation to define mitigation measures to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.</P>
              <P>(5) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to facilitate the installation of equipment necessary for safety of operations and protection of the environment;</P>
              <P>(6) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to allow for undue delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals;</P>
              <P>(7) The Director determines that continued operations would result in premature abandonment of a producing mine, resulting in the loss of otherwise recoverable OCS minerals;</P>
              <P>(8) The Director determines that the lessee cannot successfully operate a producing mine due to market conditions that are either temporary in nature or require temporary shutdown and reinvestment in order for the lessee to adapt to the conditions; or</P>
              <P>(9) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or activity, or the permitting of those activities, effective the date set by the court for that prohibition.</P>
              <P>(c) When the Director orders or approves a suspension or a temporary prohibition of operation or activity including production on all of a lease pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the term of the lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time that the suspension or temporary prohibition is in effect, except that no lease shall be so extended when the suspension or temporary prohibition is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or willful violation of a provision of the lease or governing regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) The Director may, at any time within the period prescribed for a suspension or temporary prohibition issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, require the lessee to submit a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for approval in accordance with the requirements for the approval of such plans in part 582 of this title.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) When the Director orders or issues a suspension or a temporary prohibition pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Director may require the lessee to conduct site-specific studies to identify and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the suspension or temporary prohibition, the potential for damage from the hazard(s), and the measures available for mitigating the hazard(s). The nature, scope, and content of any study shall be subject to approval by the Director. The lessee shall furnish copies and all results of any such study to the Director. The cost of the study shall be borne by the lessee unless the Director arranges for the cost of the study to be borne by a party other than the lessee. The Director shall make results of any such study available to interested parties and to the public as soon as practicable after the completion of the study and submission of the results thereof.</P>
              <P>(2) When the Director determines that measures are necessary, on the basis of the results of the studies conducted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section and other information available to and identified by the Director, the lessee will be required to take appropriate measures to mitigate, avoid, or minimize the damage or potential damage on which the suspension or temporary prohibition is based. In choosing between alternative mitigation measures, the Director will balance the cost of the required measures against the reduction or potential reduction in damage or threat of damage or harm to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), to the National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment. When deemed appropriate by the Director, the lessee must submit to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management a revised Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan that incorporates the mitigation measures required by the Director.</P>

              <P>(f)(1) If under the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, the Director, with respect to any lease, directs the suspension of production or <PRTPAGE P="345"/>other operations on the entire leasehold, no payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be due for or during the period of the directed suspension and the time for the lessee specify royalty free period of a period of reduced royalty pursuant to 30 CFR 581.28(b) will be extended for the period of directed suspension. If under the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section the Director, with respect to a lease on which there has been no production, directs the suspension of operations on the entire leasehold, no payment of rental shall be due during the period of the directed suspension.</P>
              <P>(2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director grants the request of a lessee for a suspension of production or other operations, the lessee's obligations to pay rental, minimum royalty, or royalty shall continue to apply during the period of the approved suspension, unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspension authorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approved suspension. If under the provision of this section, the Director grants a lessee's request for a suspension of production or other operations for a lease which includes provisions for a time period which the lessee may specify during which production from the leasehold would be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation pursuant to 30 CFR 581.28(b), the time during which production from a leasehold may be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation shall not be extended unless the Director's approval of the suspension specifies otherwise.</P>
              <P>(3) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief resulting therefrom.</P>

              <P>(e) The remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be concurrent and cumulative, and the exercise of one shall not preclude the exercise of the other. Further, the remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies and penalties afforded by any other law or regulation (43 U.S.C. 1350(e)).</P>

              <P>(a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for filing an appeal under § 290.3 unless:</P>

              <P>(1) BSEE notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of immediate and <PRTPAGE P="351"/>irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any mineral deposit, or property; or</P>

Penalties will begin to accrue 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access if it has not provided such access by that time. However, if BSEE determines that requiring the construction of facilities would be an appropriate remedy under the OCSLA, penalties will begin to accrue 10 days after conclusion of diligent construction of needed facilities or 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access, whichever is later, if it has not provided such access by that time;</P>
            <P>(c) Requesting the Attorney General to institute a civil action in the appropriate United States District Court under 43 U.S.C. 1350(a) for a temporary restraining order, injunction, or other appropriate remedy to enforce the open and nondiscriminatory access requirements of 43 U.S.C. 1334(e) and (f)(1)(A); or</P>

                <SUBJECT>How must I protect archaeological resources?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If the Regional Director has reason to believe that an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, the Regional Director will require in writing that your EP, DOCD, or DPP be accompanied by an archaeological report. If the archaeological report suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, you must either:</P>
                <P>(1) Locate the site of any operation so as not to adversely affect the area where the archaeological resource may be; or</P>
                <P>(2) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected by operations. This requires further archaeological investigation, conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment and techniques the Regional Director considers appropriate. You must submit the investigation report to the Regional Director for review.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological resource is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely affected by operations, the Regional Director will notify you immediately. You must not take any action that may adversely affect the archaeological resource until the Regional Director has told you how to protect the resource.</P>
                <P>(c) If you discover any archaeological resource while conducting operations in the lease or right-of-way area, you must immediately halt operations within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the BOEM Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is significant, the Regional Director will tell you how to protect it.</P>

                <P>(2) If you collected the information under a permit that BOEM issued to you before October 1, 1985, and the Regional Director requests and retains the information.</P>
                <P>(c) When you request reimbursement, you must identify reproduction and processing costs separately from acquisition costs.</P>

                <P>The Regional Supervisor will disapprove your proposed DPP or DOCD if one of the four reasons in this section applies:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Non-compliance.</E> The Regional Supervisor determines that you have failed to demonstrate that you can comply with the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (Act), implementing regulations, or other applicable Federal laws.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">No consistency concurrence.</E> (1) An affected State has not yet issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification (see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or</P>
                <P>(2) An affected State objects to your coastal zone consistency certification, and the Secretary of Commerce, under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), has not found that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Regional Supervisor disapproved your DPP or DOCD for the sole reason that an affected State either has not yet issued a final decision on, or has objected to, your coastal zone consistency certification (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) in this section), the Regional Supervisor will approve your DPP or DOCD upon receipt of concurrence by the affected State, at the time concurrence of the affected State is conclusively presumed, or when the Secretary of Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security. In that event, you do not need to resubmit your DPP or DOCD for approval under § 550.273(b).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">National security or defense conflicts.</E> Your proposed activities would threaten National security or defense.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptional circumstances.</E> The Regional Supervisor determines because of exceptional geological conditions, exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional circumstances that all of the following apply:</P>
                <P>(1) Implementing your DPP or DOCD would cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the National security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;</P>
                <P>(2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and</P>

                <P>(2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) You must submit one original and two copies of a CID to the appropriate OCS Region at the same time you first submit your DOCD or DPP for any development of a lease or leases located in water depths greater than 400 meters (1,312 feet). You must also submit a CID for a Supplemental DOCD or DPP when requested by the Regional Supervisor. The submission of your CID must be accompanied by payment of the service fee listed in § 550.125.</P>
                <P>(b) If you decide not to develop a reservoir you committed to develop in your CID, you must submit one original and two copies of a revision to the CID to the appropriate OCS Region. The revision to the CID must be submitted within 14 calendar days after making your decision not to develop the reservoir and before the reservoir is bypassed. The Regional Supervisor will approve or disapprove any such revision to the original CID. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves the revision, you must develop the reservoir as described in the original CID.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability of § 550.303 to existing facilities.</E> (1) The Regional Supervisor may review any Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan to determine whether any facility described in the plan should be subject to review under this section and has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area. To make these decisions, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the distance of the facility from shore, the size of the facility, the number of sources planned for the facility and their operational status, and the air quality status of the onshore area.</P>

              <P>(2) For a facility identified by the Regional Supervisor in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Supervisor <PRTPAGE P="423"/>shall require the lessee to refer to the information required in § 550.218 or § 550.249 of this part and to submit only that information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.</P>

The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption formulas.</E> To determine whether a facility described in a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee shall use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility for each air pollutant calculated in § 550.249(a) or § 550.218(a) of this part and compare these emissions to the emission exemption amount “E” for each air pollutant calculated using the following formulas: E = 3400D <E T="51">2/3</E> for carbon monoxide (CO); and E = 33.3D for total suspended particulates (TSP), sulphur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>), nitrogen oxides (NO<E T="52">X</E>), and VOC (where E is the emission exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of the proposed facility from the closest onshore area of a State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of these projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption amount “E” for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt from further air quality review required under paragraphs (e) through (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Significance levels.</E> For a facility not exempt under paragraph (d) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall use an approved air quality model to determine whether the projected emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Process leading to review of an existing facility.</E> (1) An affected State may request that the Regional Supervisor supply basic emission data from existing facilities when such data are needed for the updating of the State's emission inventory. In submitting the request, the State must demonstrate that similar offshore and onshore facilities in areas under the State's jurisdiction are also included in the emission inventory.</P>
              <P>(2) The Regional Supervisor may require lessees of existing facilities to submit basic emission data to a State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may submit information from its emission inventory which indicates that emissions from existing facilities may be significantly affecting the air quality of the onshore area of the State. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of the State.</P>
              <P>(4) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the information submitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall determine, based on the basic emission data, available meteorological data, and the distance of the facility or facilities from the onshore area, whether any existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of the State.</P>
              <P>(5) If the Regional Supervisor determines that no existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the State of and explain the reasons for this finding.</P>
              <P>(6) If the Regional Supervisor determines that an existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to the information requirements under § 550.218 or § 550.249 of this part and submit only that information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption formulas.</E> To determine whether an existing facility is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee shall use the highest annual <PRTPAGE P="426"/>total amount of emissions from the facility for each air pollutant calculated in § 550.218(a) or § 550.249(a) of this part and compare these emissions to the emission exemption amount “E” for each air pollutant calculated using the following formulas: E = 3400D<E T="51">2/3</E> for CO; and E = 33.3D for TSP, SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, and VOC (where E is the emission exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of the facility from the closest onshore area of the State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption amount “E” for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt for that air pollutant from further air quality review required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Significance levels.</E> For a facility not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall use an approved air quality model to determine whether projected emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are my appeal rights?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When you receive the Reviewing Officer's final decision, you have 60 days to either pay the penalty or file an appeal in accordance with 30 CFR part 590, subpart A.</P>
                <P>(b) If you file an appeal, you must either:</P>
                <P>(1) Submit a surety bond in the amount of the penalty to the appropriate Leasing Office in the Region where the penalty was assessed, following instructions that the Reviewing Officer will include in the final decision; or</P>
                <P>(2) Notify the appropriate Leasing Office, in the Region where the penalty was assessed, that you want your lease-specific/area-wide bond on file to be used as the bond for the penalty amount.</P>

                <P>(c) If you choose the alternative in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the BOEM Regional Director may require additional security (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> security in excess of your existing bond) to ensure sufficient coverage during an appeal. In that event, the Regional Director will require you to post the supplemental bond with the regional office in the same manner as under § 556.53(d) through (f) of this chapter. If the Regional Director determines the appeal should be covered by a lease-specific abandonment account then you must establish an account that meets the requirements of § 556.56.</P>
                <P>(d) If you do not either pay the penalty or file a timely appeal, BOEM will take one or more of the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) We will collect the amount you were assessed, plus interest, late payment charges, and other fees as provided by law, from the date you received the Reviewing Officer's final decision until the date we receive payment;</P>
                <P>(2) We may initiate additional enforcement, including, if appropriate, cancellation of the lease, right-of-way, license, permit, or approval, or the forfeiture of a bond under this part; or</P>
                <P>(3) We may bar you from doing further business with the Federal Government according to Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, 31 U.S.C. 6101.

            <P>(2) Permittees and third parties may apply to BOEM for an extension of the 25-year proprietary term for geophysical information reprocessed 20 or more years after BOEM issued the germane permit. You must submit the application to BOEM within 90 days after completion of the reprocessing, except during the initial 1-year grace period as provided in paragraph (b)(5) below. Filing locations are listed in § 551.5(d). Your application must include:</P>
            <P>(i) Name and address of the permittee or third party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Product name;</P>
            <P>(iii) Identification of the geophysical information area;</P>
            <P>(iv) Identification of originating permit number and date;</P>
            <P>(v) Description of reprocessing performed;</P>
            <P>(vi) Identification of the date of completion of reprocessing the geophysical information;</P>
            <P>(vii) Certification that the product meets the definition of processed geophysical information and that all other information in the application is accurate; and</P>
            <P>(viii) Signature and date.</P>
            <P>(3) With each new reprocessing of permitted data, you may apply for an extension of up to 5 years. However, the maximum proprietary term for geophysical information is 50 years after the permit was issued. Once the maximum term is reached, the BOEM Regional Director will release the information to the public.</P>
            <P>(4) Geophysical information processed or reprocessed 20 or more years after the germane permit was issued and granted the extension will be subject to submission, inspection, and selection criteria under § 551.12 and reimbursement criteria identified under § 551.13.</P>
            <P>(5) There was a 1-year grace period, that started September 14, 2009, that allowed permittees and third parties sufficient time to meet the above requirements and apply for all eligible extensions. During that time, BOEM did not release geophysical information which was reprocessed 20 or more years after the date that the germane permit was issued.</P>
            <P>(6) Since September 14, 2010, BOEM has resumed releasing eligible reprocessed information. If an application for extension was not filed, not filed on time, or not approved by BOEM, the original 25-year proprietary term applies to the release date of the reprocessed geophysical information.</P>
            <P>(7) If the data and information are related to a deep stratigraphic test, BOEM will release them to the public at the earlier of the following times:</P>
            <P>(i) Twenty-five years after you complete the test; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If a lease sale is held after you complete a test well, 60-calendar days after BOEM issues the first lease, any portion of which is located within 50 geographic miles (92.7 kilometers) of the test.</P>

            <P>(8) BOEM may allow limited inspection, but only by persons with a direct <PRTPAGE P="450"/>interest in related BOEM decisions and issues in specific geographic areas, and who agree in writing to its confidentiality, of G&amp;G data and information submitted under this part that BOEM uses to:</P>
            <P>(i) Make unitization determinations on two or more leases;</P>
            <P>(ii) Make competitive reservoir determinations;</P>
            <P>(iii) Ensure proper plans of development for competitive reservoirs;</P>
            <P>(iv) Promote operational safety;</P>
            <P>(v) Protect the environment;</P>
            <P>(vi) Make field determinations; or</P>
            <P>(vii) Determine eligibility for royalty relief.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure that BOEM follows to disclose acquired data and information to a contractor for reproduction, processing, and interpretation.</E> (1) When practical, the Regional Director will advise the person who submitted data and information under § 551.11 or § 551.12 of the intent to disclose the data or information to an independent contractor or agent.</P>
            <P>(2) The person so notified will have at least 5 working days to comment on the action.</P>
            <P>(3) When the Regional Director advises the person who submitted the data and information, all other owners of the data or information will be considered to have been so notified.</P>
            <P>(4) Before disclosure, the contractor or agent must sign a written commitment not to sell, trade, license, or disclose data or information to anyone without the Regional Director's consent.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Sharing data and information with coastal States.</E> (1) When BOEM solicits nominations for leasing lands located within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, the Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 552.7(a)(4) and (b) and subsections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will provide the Governor with:</P>
            <P>(i) All information on the geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of the areas and regions BOEM proposes to offer for lease;</P>
            <P>(ii) An estimate of the oil and gas reserves in the areas proposed for leasing; and</P>
            <P>(iii) An identification of any field, geological structure, or trap on the OCS within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of the State.</P>
            <P>(2) After receiving nominations for leasing an area of the OCS within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, BOEM will carry out a tentative area identification according to 30 CFR part 556, subparts D and E. At that time, the Regional Director will consult with the Governor to determine whether any tracts further considered for leasing may contain any oil or gas reservoirs that underlie both the OCS and lands subject to the jurisdiction of the State.</P>
            <P>(3) Before a sale, if a Governor requests, the Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 552.7(a)(4) and (b) and sections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will share with the Governor information that identifies potential and/or proven common hydrocarbon bearing areas within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of that State.</P>
            <P>(4) Information received and knowledge gained by a State official under paragraph (d) of this section is subject to applicable confidentiality requirements of:</P>
            <P>(i) The Act; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550, 551, and 552.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Oil and gas data and information to be provided for use in the OCS Oil and Gas Information Program.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any permittee or lessee engaging in the activities of exploration for, or development and production of, oil and gas on the OCS shall provide the Director access to all data and information obtained or developed as a result of such activities, including geological data, geophysical data, analyzed geological information, processed and reprocessed geophysical information, interpreted geophysical information, and interpreted geological information. Copies of these data and information and any interpretation of these data and information shall be provided to the Director upon request. No permittee or lessee submitting an interpretation of data or information, where such interpretation has been submitted in good faith, shall be held responsible for any consequence of the use of or reliance upon such interpretation.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Whenever a lessee or permittee provides any data or information, at the request of the Director and specifically for use in the OCS Oil and Gas Information Program in a form and manner of processing which is utilized by the lessee or permittee in the normal conduct of business, the Director shall pay the reasonable cost of reproducing the data and information if the lessee or permittee requests reimbursement. The cost shall be computed and paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever a lessee or permittee provides any data or information, at the request of the Director and specifically for use in the OCS Oil and Gas Information Program, in a form and manner of processing not normally utilized by the lessee or permittee in the normal conduct of business, the Director shall pay the lessee or permittee, if the lessee or permittee requests reimbursement, the reasonable cost of processing and reproducing the requested data and information. The cost is to be computed and paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) Data or information requested by the Director shall be provided as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days following receipt of the Director's request, unless, for good reason, the Director authorizes a longer time period for the submission of the requested data or information.</P>

            <P>(d) The Director reserves the right to disclose any data or information acquired from a lessee or permittee to an independent contractor or agent for the purpose of reproducing, processing, reprocessing, or interpreting such data or information. When practicable, the Director shall notify the lessee(s) or permittee(s) who provided the data or information of the intent to disclose the data or information to an independent contractor or agent. The Director's notice of intent will afford the permittee(s) or lessee(s) a period of not less than 5 working days within which to comment on the intended action. When the Director so notifies a lessee or permittee of the intent to disclose data or information to an independent <PRTPAGE P="454"/>contractor or agent, all other owners of such data or information shall be deemed to have been notified of the Director's intent. Prior to any such disclosure, the contractor or agent shall be required to execute a written commitment not to disclose any data or information to anyone without the express consent of the Director, and not to make any disclosure or use of the data or information other than that provided in the contract. Contracts between BOEM and independent contractors shall be available to the lessee(s) or permittee(s) for inspection.

              <P>(3) The Director may determine that you must demonstrate an amount of OSFR greater than the amount in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, and other risks that your COF poses. The Director may require an amount that is one or more levels higher than the amount indicated in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for your COF. The Director will not require an OSFR demonstration that exceeds $150 million.</P>

              <P>(4) You must demonstrate OSFR in the lowest amount specified in the applicable table in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for a facility with a potential worst case oil-spill discharge of 1,000 bbls or less if the Director notifies you in writing that the demonstration <PRTPAGE P="462"/>is justified by the risks of the potential oil-spill discharge.</P>

              <P>(a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a facility under § 553.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following regulations applies:</P>
              <P>(1) 30 CFR part 254—Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume that you estimate for the first 24 hours.</P>

              <P>(b) You must ensure that new OSFR evidence is submitted before your current evidence lapses or is canceled and that coverage for your new COF is submitted before the COF goes into operation.</P>
              <P>(c) If you use self-insurance to demonstrate OSFR and find that you no longer qualify to self-insure the required OSFR amount based upon your latest audited annual financial statements, then you must demonstrate OSFR using other methods acceptable to BOEM by whichever of the following dates comes first:</P>
              <P>(1) Sixty calendar days after you receive your latest audited annual financial statement; or</P>
              <P>(2) The first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(d) You may use a surety bond to demonstrate OSFR. If you find that your bonding company has lost its state license or has had its U.S. Treasury Department certification revoked, then you must replace the surety bond within 15 calendar days using a method of OSFR that is acceptable to BOEM.</P>
              <P>(e) You must notify BOEM in writing within 15 calendar days after a change occurs that would prevent you from meeting your OSFR obligations (e.g., if you or your indemnitor petition for bankruptcy under chapters 7 or 11 of Title 11, U.S.C.). You must take any action BOEM directs to ensure an acceptable OSFR demonstration.</P>
              <P>(f) If you deny payment of a claim presented to you under § 553.60, then you must give the claimant a written explanation for your denial.</P>

              <P>(1) The total amount of OSFR evidence must equal the total amount you must demonstrate under § 553.13;</P>

              <P>(2) No more than one insurance certificate may be used to cover each OSFR layer specified in § 553.13(b) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> four layers for an OCS COF, and five layers for a non-OCS COF);</P>

              <P>(4) Each insurer's participation in the covered insurance risk must be on a proportional (quota share) basis, must be expressed as a percentage of a whole layer, and the certificate must not contain intermediate, horizontal layers;</P>

              <P>(5) You may use an insurance deductible. If you use more than one insurance certificate, the deductible amount must apply only to the certificate that covers the base OSFR amount layer. To satisfy an insurance deductible, you may use only those methods that are <PRTPAGE P="465"/>acceptable as evidence of OSFR under this part; and</P>

              <P>(d) You may submit to BOEM a temporary insurance confirmation (fax binder) for each insurance certificate you use as OSFR evidence. Submit your fax binder on Form BOEM-1019, and each form must include the signature of an underwriter for at least one of the participating insurers. BOEM will accept your fax binder as OSFR evidence during a period that ends 90 days after the date that you need the insurance to demonstrate OSFR.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the procedure for calculating the limit of liability adjustment for inflation?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The procedure for calculating limit of liability adjustments for inflation is as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Formula for calculating a cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U.</E> BOEM calculates the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit of liability was established by statute, or last adjusted by regulation, whichever is later (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the Previous Period), to the year in which the Annual CPI-U is most recently published (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the Current Period), using the following formula: Percent change in the Annual CPI-U = [(Annual CPI-U for Current Period − Annual CPI-U for Previous Period) ÷ Annual CPI-U for Previous Period] × 100. This cumulative percent change value is rounded to one decimal place.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance threshold.</E> (1) A cumulative increase in the Annual CPI-U equal to three percent or more constitutes a significant increase in the Consumer Price Index within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. 2704(d)(4).</P>
              <P>(2) Not later than every three years from the year the limit of liability was last adjusted for inflation, BOEM will evaluate whether the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since that year has reached a significance threshold of three percent or greater.</P>

              <P>(3) For any three-year period evaluated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in which the cumulative percent increase in the Annual CPI-U is less than three percent, if BOEM has not issued an inflation adjustment during that period, BOEM will publish a notice of no inflation adjustment to the offshore facility limit of liability for damages in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
              <P>(4) Once the three-percent threshold is reached, BOEM will increase by final rule the offshore facility limit of liability for damages in § 553.702 by an amount equal to the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit was established by statute, or last adjusted by regulation, whichever is later. After this adjustment is made, BOEM will resume its process of conducting a review every three years.</P>
              <P>(5) Nothing in this section will prevent BOEM, in BOEM's sole discretion, from adjusting the offshore facility limit of liability for damages for inflation by regulation issued more frequently than every three years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Formula for calculating inflation adjustments.</E> BOEM calculates adjustments to the offshore facility limit of liability in 30 CFR 553.702 for inflation using the following formula:

                <P>In accordance with OCSLA section 18(a)(4) (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)(4)), BOEM must evaluate every bid to ensure that the federal government receives fair market value for every lease. Section 26(a)(1)(A) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1352(a)(1)(A)) provides that, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any lessee or permittee conducting any exploration for, or development or production of, oil or gas must provide the Secretary access to all data and information (including processed, analyzed, and interpreted information) obtained from that activity and must provide copies of that data and information as the Secretary may request.</P>
                <P>(a) As part of the lease sale process, every bidder submitting a bid on a tract, or participating as a joint bidder in such a bid, may at the time of bid be required to submit various information, including a Geophysical Data and Information Statement (GDIS) corresponding to that tract, as well as the bidder's exclusive/proprietary geophysical data in order for BOEM to properly evaluate the bid. If a GDIS required, each GDIS must include, as required by § 551.12(b) and (c) of this chapter:</P>
                <P>(1) A list of geophysical surveys or other information used as part of the decision to bid or participate in a bid on the block.</P>
                <P>(2) An accurate and complete record of each geophysical survey conducted, including digital navigational data and final location maps. The bidder and any joint bidder must include a map for each survey identified in the GDIS that illustrates the actual areal extent of the proprietary geophysical data.</P>
                <P>(b) If a bidder is required to submit a GDIS, the GDIS must be submitted even if the bidder did not rely on proprietary geophysical data and information in deciding to bid or participate as a joint bidder in the bid for any particular block, and must include entries for all such blocks.</P>
                <P>(c) The bidder must submit each GDIS in a separate and sealed envelope, or in an electronically readable spreadsheet format, with proprietary seismic data maps also available in an electronic format. Each bidder must submit the GDIS even if its joint bidder or bidders on a specific block also have submitted a GDIS.</P>

                <P>(b) If BOEM places you on the restricted joint bidders list, BOEM will send you a copy of the order placing you on the list. You may appeal this order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 590, subpart A.</P>
                <P>(c) If you are listed in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in any group of restricted bidders, you may not bid:</P>

                <P>(b)(1) A record title owner owns operating rights to the lease, unless and until he or she severs the operating rights by subleasing them to someone else.</P>
                <P>(2) A sublease of operating rights from record title may be for a whole or undivided fractional interest in the entire lease or a described aliquot portion of the lease and/or a depth interval. The sublease creates an operating rights interest in the sublessee, herein referred to as the operating rights owner.</P>
                <P>(c) Within any given aliquot, the record title owner may sublease operating rights for up to a maximum of two depth divisions, which may result in a maximum of three different depth intervals. But, if the one, or two, depth divisions to which operating rights are subleased do not include the entire depth of the lease, whatever depth division(s) has not been subleased, remains part of the lessee/sublessor's record title interest. The depth intervals for which operating rights are subleased must be defined by a beginning and ending depth and the ending of one depth level must abut the beginning of the next depth level, with no gap in between.</P>

                <P>(d) Every current and prior record title owner is jointly and severally liable, along with all other record title owners and all prior and current operating rights owners, for compliance with all non-monetary terms and conditions of the lease and all regulations issued under OCSLA, as well as for fulfilling all non-monetary obligations, including decommissioning obligations, which accrue while it holds record title interest.<PRTPAGE P="494"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) Record title owners that acquired their record title interests through assignment from a prior record title owner are also responsible for remedying all existing environmental or operational problems on any lease in which they own record title interests, with subrogation rights against prior lessees.</P>
                <P>(f) For monetary obligations, your obligation depends on the source of the monetary obligation and whether you have retained or severed your operating rights.</P>
                <P>(1) With respect to those operating rights that you have retained, you are primarily liable under 30 U.S.C. 1712(a) for your pro-rata share of all other monetary obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to the operating rights you have retained, based on your share of operating rights in that portion of the lease.</P>
                <P>(2) With respect to all monetary obligations arising from or in connection with those operating rights that have been severed from your record title interest, your obligation is secondary to that of the sublessee(s) or later assignee(s) of the operating rights that were severed from your record title interest, as prescribed in 30 U.S.C. 1712(a).</P>

                <P>(c) An owner of operating rights who is designating a new designated operator must file a designation of operator under § 550.143 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(d) An operating rights owner is only liable for obligations arising from that portion of the lease to which its operating rights appertain and that accrue during the period in which the operating rights owner owned the operating rights.</P>
                <P>(e) You are jointly and severally liable with other operating rights owners and the record title owners for all non-monetary lease obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to your operating rights, which accrued during the time you held your operating rights interest.</P>
                <P>(f) An operating rights owner that acquires its operating rights interests through assignment from a prior operating rights owner is also responsible, with subrogation rights against prior operating rights owners, for remedying existing environmental or operational problems, to the extent that such problems arise from that portion of the lease to which its operating rights appertain, on any lease in which it owns operating rights.</P>
                <P>(g) You are primarily liable for monetary obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to your operating rights, and the record title owners are secondarily liable.

              <P>(a) The Regional Director will provide the form to record an assignment of record title interest in a Federal OCS oil and gas or sulfur lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest. You must submit to BOEM two originals of each instrument that transfers ownership of record title within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument.

              <P>(a) When there is an assignment by all record title owners of 100 percent of the record title to one or more aliquots in a lease, the assigned and retained portions become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such case, both the new lease and the remaining portion of the original lease are referred to as “segregated leases” and the assignee(s) becomes the record title owner(s) of the new lease, which is subject to all the terms and conditions of the original lease.</P>

              <P>(b) If a record title holder transfers an undivided interest, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> less than 100 percent of the record title interest in any given aliquot(s), that transfer will not segregate the portions of the aliquots, or the whole aliquots, in which part of the record title was transferred, into separate leases from the portion(s) in which no interest was transferred. Instead, that transfer will create a joint ownership between the assignee(s) and assignor(s) in the portions of the lease in which part of the record title interest was transferred. Any transfer of an undivided interest is subject to approval by BOEM.</P>

              <P>(a) Before BOEM will issue a new lease or approve the assignment of an existing lease to you as lessee, you or another record title owner for the lease must:</P>
              <P>(1) Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or</P>
              <P>(2) Maintain a $300,000 area-wide bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulfur leases in the area where the lease is located; or</P>
              <P>(3) Maintain a lease or area-wide bond in the amount required in § 556.901(a) or (b).</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of this section, there are three areas. The three areas are:</P>
              <P>(1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast;</P>
              <P>(2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and</P>
              <P>(3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.</P>
              <P>(c) The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security instrument) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 556.901(a) and (b) may be satisfied if your operator or an operating rights owner provides a lease bond in the required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease. Your operator or an operating rights owner may use an areawide bond under this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.</P>
              <P>(d) If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or alternative form of security maintained under this section, the surety's remaining liability under the bond or alternative form of security is reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.</P>
              <P>(e) If the value of your surety bond or alternative security is reduced because of a default or for any other reason, you must provide additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the Regional Director may direct.</P>

              <P>(f) You may pledge United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) <PRTPAGE P="501"/>securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they replace.</P>
              <P>(1) If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the required amount.</P>
              <P>(2) If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds in the event that the Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease obligation.</P>
              <P>(g) You may pledge alternative types of security instruments instead of providing a bond if the Regional Director determines that the alternative security protects the interests of the United States to the same extent as the required bond.</P>

              <P>(a) The Regional Director may authorize you to establish a lease-specific abandonment account in a federally insured institution in lieu of the bond required under § 556.901(d). The account must provide that, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, funds may not be withdrawn without the written approval of the Regional Director.</P>
              <P>(1) Funds in a lease-specific abandonment account must be payable upon demand to BOEM and pledged to meet your decommissioning obligations.</P>
              <P>(2) You must fully fund the lease-specific abandonment account to cover all decommissioning costs as estimated by BOEM within the timeframe the Regional Director prescribes.</P>
              <P>(3) You must provide binding instructions under which the institution managing the account is to purchase Treasury securities pledged to BOEM under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

The institution managing the lease specific-abandonment account will join with the Regional Director to establish a Federal Reserve Circular 154 account to hold these Treasury securities, unless the Regional Director authorizes the managing institution to retain the pledged Treasury securities in a separate trust account. You may obtain a copy of the current Treasury Circular No. 154 from the Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</P>

The required obligation may be associated with oil and gas or sulfur production from a lease other than the lease bonded through the lease-specific abandonment account.</P>

              <P>This section defines the terms and conditions under which BOEM will terminate the period of liability of a bond or cancel a bond. Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during which obligations continue to accrue, but does not relieve the surety of the responsibility for obligations that accrued during the period of liability. Canceling a bond relieves the surety of all liability. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include obligations that started to accrue prior to the beginning of the period of liability and had not been met, and obligations that begin accruing during the period of liability.</P>
              <P>(a) When you or the surety under your bond requests termination:</P>
              <P>(1) The Regional Director will terminate the period of liability under your bond within 90 days after BOEM receives the request; and</P>
              <P>(2) If you intend to continue operations, or have not met all decommissioning obligations, you must provide a replacement bond of an equivalent amount.</P>
              <P>(b) If you provide a replacement bond, the Regional Director will cancel your previous bond and the surety that provided your previous bond will not retain any liability, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The new bond is equal to or greater than the bond that was terminated, or you provide an alternative form of security, and the Regional Director determines that the alternative form of security provides a level of security equal to or greater than that provided for by the bond that was terminated;</P>
              <P>(2) For a base bond submitted under § 556.900(a) or under § 556.901(a) or (b), the surety issuing the new bond agrees to assume all outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and</P>
              <P>(3) For additional bonds submitted under § 556.901(d), the surety issuing the new additional bond agrees to assume that portion of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated and that the Regional Director determines may exceed the coverage of the base bond, and of which the Regional Director notifies the provider of the bond.</P>
              <P>(c) This paragraph applies if the period of liability is terminated for a bond, but the bond is not replaced by a bond of an equivalent amount. The surety that provided your terminated bond will continue to be responsible for accrued obligations:</P>
              <P>(1) Until the obligations are satisfied; and</P>
              <P>(2) For additional periods of time in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) When your lease expires or is terminated, the surety that issued a bond will continue to be responsible, and the Regional Director will retain other forms of security as shown in the following table:</P>

              <P>(1) You (the party who provided the bond) refuse, or the Regional Director determines that you are unable to comply with any term or condition of your lease; or</P>

              <P>(c) The Regional Director will:</P>
              <P>(1) Notify you, the surety on your bond or other form of security, and any third-party guarantor of a determination to call for forfeiture of the bond, security, or guarantee under this section.</P>
              <P>(i) This notice will be in writing, and will provide the reason for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Regional Director must base the amount he/she determines is forfeited upon his/her estimate of the total cost of corrective action to bring your lease into compliance.</P>
              <P>(2) Advise you, your third-party guarantor, and any surety that you, your guarantor, and any surety may avoid forfeiture if, within five working days:</P>
              <P>(i) You agree to, and demonstrate that you will bring your lease into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director prescribes;</P>
              <P>(ii) Your third-party guarantor agrees to and demonstrates that it will complete the corrective action to bring your lease into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director prescribes; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Your surety agrees to and demonstrates that it will bring your lease into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director prescribes, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the face amount of the bond or other surety instrument.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Regional Director finds you are in default, he/she may cause the forfeiture of any bonds and other security deposited as your guarantee of compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter and 30 CFR chapters II and XII.</P>

              <P>(1) Take or direct action to obtain full compliance with your lease and the regulations in this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(2) Recover from you, any co-lessee, operating rights owner, and/or any third-party guarantor responsible under this subpart all costs in excess of the amount he/she collects under your forfeited bond and other security.</P>
              <P>(g) The amount that the Regional Director collects under your forfeited bond and other security may exceed the costs of taking the corrective actions required to obtain full compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter and 30 CFR chapters II and XII. In this case, the Regional Director will return the excess funds to the party from whom they were collected.</P>

              <P>(b) Your producing lease may be cancelled if you fail to comply with any provision of OCSLA, the lease, or applicable regulations. The Secretary will cancel a producing lease after the judicial proceedings required under section 5(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(d)).</P>
              <P>(c) BOEM may cancel your lease if it determines that the lease was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. You will have notice and an opportunity to be heard before BOEM cancels your lease.</P>
              <P>(d) BOEM may cancel your lease at any time if it determines, after a hearing, that continued activity will probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral, national security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment; that the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable level within a reasonable period of time; and the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing the lease.</P>
              <P>(e) BOEM may cancel your lease at any time after operations under the lease have been suspended or temporarily prohibited by the Department continuously for a period of five years pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, absent your request for a shorter period.</P>

              <P>(a) All regulations in this part, insofar as they are applicable, will supersede the provisions of any lease that is maintained under section 6(a) of the Act. However, the provisions of a lease relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties (subject to sections 6(a)(8) and (9) of the Act), and term (subject to section 6(a)(10) of the Act and, as to sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) will continue in effect, and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, will take precedence over these regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act is also subject to all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the OCS. In addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological exploratory operations and to pipeline ROW(s) are applicable, to the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent with the lease provisions relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties and term. The lessee must comply with any provision of the lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the regulations in this part.</P>

The United States will not grant any sulfur leases on any area that is included in a lease covering sulfur under section 6(b) of the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) The Director will conduct a study or studies of any area or region included in any oil and gas lease sale or other lease in order to establish information needed for assessment and management of impacts on the human, marine and coastal environments which may be affected by OCS oil and gas or other mineral activities in such area or region. The purposes of such studies will include, to the extent practicable, analyses of the impacts of pollutants introduced into the environments and impacts of offshore activities on the seabed and affected coastal areas.</P>
              <P>(b) Studies will be planned and carried out in cooperation with the affected States and interested parties and, to the extent possible, will not duplicate studies done under other laws. Where appropriate, the Director will, to the maximum extent practicable, coordinate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in executing its environmental studies responsibilities. The Director may also make agreements for the coordination with, or the use of the services or resources of, any other Federal, State or local government agency in the conduct of such studies.</P>
              <P>(c) Any study of an area or region required by paragraph (a) of this section for a lease sale will be commenced not later than six months prior to holding a lease sale for that area. The Director may use information collected in any prior study. The Director may initiate studies for an area or region not identified in the leasing program.</P>

              <P>(d) After the leasing and developing of any area or region, the Director will conduct such studies as are deemed necessary to establish additional information and will monitor the human, marine and coastal environments of such area or region in a manner designed to provide information, which can be compared with the results of studies conducted prior to OCS oil and gas development. This will be done to identify any significant changes in the <PRTPAGE P="510"/>quality and productivity of such environments, to establish trends in the area studies, and to design experiments identifying the causes of such changes. Findings from such studies will be used to recommend modifications in practices that are employed to mitigate the effects of OCS activities and to enhance the data/information base for predicting impacts which might result from a single lease sale or cumulative OCS activities.</P>
              <P>(e) Information available or collected by the studies program will, to the extent practicable, be provided in a form and in a timeframe that can be used in the decision-making process associated with a specific leasing action or with longer term OCS minerals management responsibilities.</P>

                <P>(a) For each of the bidding systems in § 560.110, we will include an annual rental fee. Other fees and provisions may apply as well. The Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> will specify the annual rental and any other fees the highest responsible qualified bidder must pay and any other provisions.</P>

                <P>(b) If we use any deferment or schedule of payments for the cash bonus bid, we will specify and include it in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(c) For the bidding systems listed in this subpart, if the bid variable is a cash bonus bid, the highest bid by a qualified bidder determines the amount of cash bonus to be paid. We will include the minimum bid level(s) in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(d) For the bidding systems listed in this subpart, if the bid variable is the royalty rate, the highest bid by a qualified bidder determines the royalty rate to be paid. We will include the minimum royalty rate(s) in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(e) We may, by rule, add to or modify the bidding systems listed in § 560.110, according to the procedural requirements of the OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. 1331 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended by Public Law 95-372, 92 Stat. 629.</P>

                <P>(a) We will specify any royalty suspension for your RS lease in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for the sale in which you acquire the RS lease and will repeat it in the lease document. In addition:</P>
                <P>(1) Your RS lease may produce royalty-free the royalty suspension we specify for your lease, even if the field to which we assign it is producing.</P>

                <P>(b) You may apply for a supplemental royalty suspension for a project under 30 CFR part 203, if your lease is located:</P>
                <P>(1) In the Gulf of Mexico, in water 200 meters or deeper, and wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or</P>
                <P>(2) Offshore of Alaska.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How long will a royalty suspension volume be effective for a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The royalty suspension volume for your RS lease will continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production from your lease reaches the applicable royalty suspension volume or the lease period ends.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Notwithstanding any royalty suspension volume under this subpart, you must pay royalty at the lease stipulated rate on:</P>
                <P>(i) Any oil produced for any period stipulated in the lease during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for light sweet crude oil exceeds the applicable threshold price of $36.39 per barrel, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any natural gas produced for any period stipulated in the lease during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the NYMEX for natural gas exceeds the applicable threshold price of $4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.</P>
                <P>(iii) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar year.</P>

                <P>(2) You must pay any royalty due under this paragraph, plus late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54, no <PRTPAGE P="516"/>later than 90 days after the end of the period for which royalty is owed.</P>
                <P>(3) Any production on which you must pay royalty under this paragraph will count toward the production volume determined under §§ 560.120 through 560.124.</P>
                <P>(c) If you must pay royalty on any product (either oil or natural gas) for any period under paragraph (b) of this section, you must continue to pay royalty on that product during the next succeeding period of the same length until the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX prices for that product for that period can be determined. If the arithmetic average of the daily closing prices for that product for that period is less than the threshold price stipulated in the lease, you are entitled to a credit or refund of royalties paid for that period with interest under applicable law.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How will royalty suspension apply if BOEM assigns a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000 to a field that has a pre-Act lease?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) We will assign your lease that has a qualifying well (under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A) to an existing field or designate a new field and will notify you and other affected lessees and operating rights holders in the field of that assignment.</P>
                <P>(1) Within 15 days of the final notification, you or any of the other affected lessees or operating rights holders may file a written request with the Director for reconsideration, accompanied by a Statement of Reasons.</P>
                <P>(2) The Director will respond in writing either affirming or reversing the assignment decision. The Director's decision is the final action of the Department of the Interior and is not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 590 and 43 CFR part 4.</P>
                <P>(b) If we establish a royalty suspension volume for a field as a result of an approved application for royalty relief submitted for a pre-Act lease under 30 CFR part 203, then:</P>
                <P>(1) Royalty-free production from your RS lease shares from and counts as part of any royalty suspension volume under § 560.114(d) for the field to which we assign your lease; and</P>
                <P>(2) Your RS lease may continue to produce royalty-free up to the royalty suspension we specified for your lease, even if the field to which we assign your RS lease has produced all of its royalty suspension volume.</P>
                <P>(c) Your lease may share in a suspension volume larger than the royalty suspension with which we issued it and to the extent we grant a larger volume in response to an application by a pre-Act lease submitted under 30 CFR part 203. To share in any larger royalty suspension volume, you must file an application described in 30 CFR part 203 (§§ 203.71 and 203.83). In no case will royalty-free production for your RS lease be less than the royalty suspension specified for your lease.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for OCS mineral information and interest.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) When considering whether to offer OCS minerals for lease, the Secretary, upon the Department of the Interior's own initiative or as a result of a submission under § 581.11, may request indications of interest in the leasing of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS minerals in the area being considered for lease. Requests for information and interest shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and may be published elsewhere.</P>
              <P>(b) States and local governments, industry, other Federal Agencies, and all interested parties (including the public) may respond to a request for information and interest. All information provided to the Secretary will be considered in the decision whether to proceed with additional steps leading to the offering of OCS minerals for lease.</P>

              <P>(c) The Secretary may request specific information concerning the offering of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS minerals in a broad area for lease or the offering of one or more discrete tracts which represent a minable orebody. The Secretary's request may ask for comments on OCS areas which have been determined to warrant special consideration and analysis. Requests may be for comments concerning geological conditions or archaeological resources on the seabed; multiple uses of the area proposed for leasing, including navigation, <PRTPAGE P="535"/>recreation and fisheries; and other socioeconomic, biological, and environmental information relating to the area proposed for leasing.</P>

              <P>(a) The Secretary may invite the adjacent State Governor(s) to join in, or the adjacent State Governor(s) may request that the Secretary join in, the establishment of a State/Federal task force or some other joint planning or coordination arrangement when industry interest exists for OCS mineral leasing or geological information appears to support the leasing of OCS minerals in specific areas. Participation in joint State/Federal task forces or other arrangements will afford the adjacent State Governor(s) opportunity for access to available data and information about the area; knowledge of progress made in the leasing process and of the results of subsequent exploration and development activities; facilitate the resolution of issues of mutual interest; and provide a mechanism for planning, coordination, consultation, and other activities which the Secretary and the Governor(s) may identify as contributing to the leasing process.</P>
              <P>(b) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements are to be constituted pursuant to such terms and conditions (consistent with Federal law and these regulations) as the Secretary and the adjacent State Governor(s) may agree.</P>
              <P>(c) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements will provide a forum which the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) may use for planning, consultation, and coordination on concerns associated with the offering of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur for lease.</P>
              <P>(d) With respect to the activities authorized under these regulations each State/Federal task force may make recommendations to the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) concerning:</P>
              <P>(1) The identification of areas in which OCS minerals might be offered for lease;</P>
              <P>(2) The potential for conflicts between the exploration and development of OCS mineral resources, other users and uses of the area, and means for resolution or mitigation of these conflicts;</P>
              <P>(3) The economic feasibility of developing OCS mineral resources in the area proposed for leasing;</P>
              <P>(4) Potential environmental problems and measures that might be taken to mitigate these problems;</P>
              <P>(5) Development of guidelines and procedures for safe, environmentally responsible exploration and development practices; and</P>
              <P>(6) Other issues of concern to the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s).</P>
              <P>(e) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements might also be used to conduct or oversee research, studies, or reports (e.g., Environmental Impact Statements).</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, an overriding royalty interest may be created by an assignment pursuant to section 8(e) of the Act. The Secretary may deny approval of an assignment which creates an overriding royalty on a lease whenever that denial is determined to be in the interest of conservation, necessary to prevent premature abandonment of a producing mine, or to make possible the mining of economically marginal or low-grade ore deposits. In any case, the total of applicable overriding royalties may not exceed 2.5 percent or one-half the base royalty due the Federal Government, whichever is less.</P>
              <P>(b) No transfer or agreement may be made which creates an overriding royalty interest unless the owner of that interest files an agreement in writing that such interest is subject to the limitations provided in § 581.30 of this part, paragraph (a) of this section, and § 581.32 of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, minimum royalty, and/or production royalty prescribed in a lease for a specified time period when the Secretary determines that it is in the National interest, it will result in the conservation of natural resources of the OCS, it will promote development, or the mine cannot be successfully operated under existing conditions.</P>
              <P>(b) An application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty, or production royalty under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed in duplicate with the Director. The application shall contain the serial number(s) of the lease(s), the name of the lessee(s) of record, and the operator(s) if applicable. The application shall either:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Show the location and extent of all mining operations and a tabulated statement of the minerals mined and subject to royalty for each of the last 12 months immediately prior to filing the application:</P>

              <P>(ii) Contain a detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating the lease, the income from the sale of any lease products, and the amount of all overriding royalties and payments out of production paid to others than the United States; and<PRTPAGE P="541"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) All facts showing whether or not the mine(s) can be successfully operated under the royalty fixed in the lease; or</P>
              <P>(2) If no production has occurred from the lease, show that the lease cannot be successfully operated under the rental, royalty, and other conditions specified in the lease.</P>
              <P>(c) The applicant for a waiver, suspension, or reduction under this section shall file documentation that the lessee and the royalty holders agree to a reduction of all other royalties from the lease so that the aggregate of all other royalties does not exceed one-half the amount of the reduced royalties that would be paid to the United States.</P>

              <P>(a) When the leasing notice specifies that payment of a portion of the bonus bid can be deferred, the lessee shall be required to submit a surety or personal bond to guarantee payment of a deferred portion of the bid. Upon the payment of the full amount of the cash bonus bid, the lessee's bond will be released.</P>
              <P>(b) All bonds to guarantee payment of the deferred portion of the high cash bonus bid furnished by the lessee must be in a form or on a form approved by the Deputy Director. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety.</P>
              <P>(1) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted (see Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or replacement circulars).</P>
              <P>(2) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of the lease.</P>
              <P>(c) Prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease(s), the lessee shall submit a surety or personal bond as described in § 582.40 of this title. Prior to the approval of a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.</P>

Any such cancellation is subject to judicial review as provided by section 23(b) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever the owner of any producing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the Act, the Secretary may cancel the lease only after judicial proceedings pursuant to section 5(d) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be entitled to compensation.</P>

              <P>(3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, or</P>

              <P>(ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease (plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or parties and be issued the lease in question.<PRTPAGE P="544"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:</P>
              <P>(A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to section (5)(d) of the Act;</P>
              <P>(B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of applicable Federal Law; or</P>

              <P>(b) All bonds furnished by a lessee or operator must be in a form approved by the Deputy Director. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety.</P>
              <P>(c) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted (see Department of Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or replacement circulars).</P>
              <P>(d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of the lease.</P>
              <P>(e) A bond in the minimum amount of $50,000 to cover the lessee's obligations under the lease shall be submitted prior to the commencement of any activity on a leasehold. A $50,000 bond shall not be required on a lease if the lessee already maintains or furnishes a $300,000 bond conditioned on compliance with the terms of leases for OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur held by the lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is located. A bond submitted pursuant to § 556.58(a) of this chapter may be amended to include the aforementioned condition for compliance. Prior to approval of a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.</P>

              <P>(3) The area offshore the coast of Alaska.</P>
              <P>(g) A separate bond shall be required for each area. An operator's bond may be submitted for a specific lease(s) in the same amount as the lessee's bond(s) applicable to the lease(s) involved.</P>
              <P>(h) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the surety bond and the surety's liability thereunder shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.</P>
              <P>(i) After default, the principal shall, within 6 months after notice or within such shorter period as may be fixed by the Director, either post a new bond or increase the existing bond to the amount previously held. In lieu thereof, the principal may, within that time, file separate or substitute bonds for each lease. Failure to meet these requirements may result in a suspension of operations including production on leases covered by such bonds.</P>
              <P>(j) The Director shall not consent to termination of the period of liability of any bond unless an acceptable alternative bond has been filed or until all the terms and conditions of the lease covered by the bond have been met.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When and how does BOEM charge me processing fees on a case-by-case basis?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) BOEM will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis under the procedures in this section with regard to any application or request under this part if we decide at any time that the preparation of a particular document <PRTPAGE P="578"/>or study is necessary for the application or request and it will have a unique processing cost, such as the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</P>
              <P>(1) Processing costs will include contract oversight and efforts to review and approve documents prepared by contractors, whether the contractor is paid directly by the applicant or through BOEM.</P>
              <P>(2) We may apply a standard overhead rate to direct processing costs.</P>
              <P>(b) We will assess the ongoing processing fee for each individual application or request according to the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) Before we process your application or request, we will give you a written estimate of the proposed fee based on reasonable processing costs.</P>
              <P>(2) You may comment on the proposed fee.</P>
              <P>(3) You may:</P>
              <P>(i) Ask for our approval to perform, or to directly pay a contractor to perform, all or part of any document, study, or other activity according to standards we specify, thereby reducing our costs for processing your application or request; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Ask to pay us to perform, or contract for, all or part of any document, study, or other activity.</P>
              <P>(4) We will then give you the final estimate of the processing fee amount with payment terms and instructions after considering your comments and any BOEM-approved work you will do.</P>
              <P>(i) If we encounter higher or lower processing costs than anticipated, we will re-estimate our reasonable processing costs following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, but we will not stop ongoing processing unless you do not pay in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once processing is complete, we will refund to you the amount of money that we did not spend on processing costs.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) Consistent with the payment and billing terms provided in the final estimate, we will periodically estimate what our reasonable processing costs will be for a specific period and will bill you for that period. Payment is due to us 30 days after you receive your bill. We will stop processing your document if you do not pay the bill by the date payment is due.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than our reasonable processing costs for the period, we will adjust the next billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a payment without our prior written approval.</P>
              <P>(6) You must pay the entire fee before we will issue the final document or take final action on your application or request.</P>
              <P>(7) You may appeal our estimated processing costs in accordance with the regulations in 43 CFR part 4. We will not process the document further until the appeal is resolved, unless you pay the fee under protest while the appeal is pending. If the appeal results in a decision changing the proposed fee, we will adjust the fee in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If we adjust the fee downward, we will not pay interest.</P>

                <P>(f) The BOEM may assess civil penalties, as authorized by section 24 of the OCS Lands Act, if you fail to comply with any provision of this part or any term of a lease, grant, or order issued under the authority of this part, after notice of such failure and expiration of any reasonable period allowed for corrective action.

                <P>(a) If you intend to designate an operator who is not the lessee or grant holder, you must identify the proposed operator in your SAP (under § 585.610(a)(3)), COP (under § 585.626(b)(2)), or GAP (under § 585.645(b)(3)), as applicable. If no operator is designated in a SAP, COP, or GAP, BOEM will deem the lessee or grant holder to be the operator.</P>
                <P>(b) An operator must be designated in any SAP, COP, or GAP if there is more than one lessee or grant holder for any individual lease or grant.</P>
                <P>(c) Once approved in your plan, the designated operator is authorized to act on your behalf and required to perform activities necessary to comply with the OCS Lands Act, the lease or grant, and the regulations in this part.</P>
                <P>(d) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide BOEM with a written notification of change of address of the lessee or operator.</P>
                <P>(e) If there is a change in the designated operator, you must provide written notice to BOEM and identify the new designated operator within 72 hours on a form approved by BOEM. The lessee(s) or grantee(s) is the operator and responsible for compliance until BOEM approves designation of the new operator.</P>
                <P>(f) Designation of an operator under any lease or grant issued under this part does not relieve the lessee or grant holder of its obligations under this part or its lease or grant.</P>
                <P>(g) A designated operator performing activities on the lease must comply with all regulations governing those activities and may be held liable or penalized for any noncompliance during the time it was operator, notwithstanding its subsequent resignation.</P>

                <P>(c) BOEM will specify operating fee parameters in the Final Sale Notice for commercial leases issued competitively and in the lease for those issued noncompetitively.</P>

                <P>(1) Unless BOEM specifies otherwise, in the operating fee rate, “r” is 0.02 for each year the operating fee applies when you begin commercial generation of electricity. We may apply a different fee rate for new projects (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a new generation based on new technology) after considering factors such as program objectives, state of the industry, project type, and project potential. Also, we may agree to reduce or waive the fee rate under § 585.510.</P>

                <P>(3) BOEM will select the capacity factor “c” based upon applicable analogs drawn from present and future domestic and foreign projects that operate in comparable conditions and on comparable scales.</P>
                <P>(i) Upon the completion of the first year of commercial operations on the lease, BOEM may adjust the capacity factor as necessary (to accurately represent a comparison of actual production over a given period of time with the amount of power a facility would have produced if it had run at full capacity) in a subsequent year.</P>
                <P>(ii) After the first adjustment, BOEM may adjust the capacity factor (to accurately represent a comparison of actual generation over a given period of time with the amount of power a facility would have generated if it had run at full capacity) no earlier than in 5-year intervals from the most recent year that BOEM adjusts the capacity factor.</P>
                <P>(iii) The process by which BOEM will adjust the capacity factor, including any calculations (incorporating an average capacity factor reflecting actual operating experience), will be specified in the lease. The operator or lessee may request review and adjustment of the capacity factor under § 585.510.</P>
                <P>(4) Ten days after the anniversary date of when you began to commercially generate electricity, you must submit to BOEM documentation of the gross annual generation of electricity produced by the generating facility on the lease. You must use the same information collection form as authorized by the EIA for this information.</P>
                <P>(5) For the nameplate capacity “M,” BOEM will use the total installed capacity of the equipment you install, as specified in your approved COP.</P>
                <P>(d) You must submit all operating fee payments to BOEM in accordance with the provisions under 30 CFR 1218.51.</P>
                <P>(e) BOEM will establish the operating fee in the Final Sale Notice or in the lease on a case-by-case basis for:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Do my financial assurance requirements change as activities progress on my limited lease or grant?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) BOEM may require you to increase the level of your financial assurance as activities progress on your limited lease or grant. We will base the determination for the amount of financial assurance requirements on our estimate of the cost to meet all accrued lease or grant obligations, including:</P>
                <P>(1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the Government over the next 12 months;</P>

                <P>(b) You may satisfy the requirement for increased financial assurance levels for the limited lease or grant by increasing the amount of your existing bond or replacing your existing bond.</P>
                <P>(c) BOEM will authorize you to establish a separate decommissioning bond or other financial assurance for your limited lease or grant.</P>
                <P>(1) The separate decommissioning bond or other financial assurance instrument must meet the requirements specified in §§ 585.525 through 585.529.</P>
                <P>(2) BOEM will allow you to provide your financial assurance for decommissioning in accordance with the number of facilities installed or being installed. BOEM must approve the schedule for providing the appropriate financial assurance coverage.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What general requirements must a financial assurance instrument meet?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Any bond or other acceptable financial assurance instrument that you provide must:</P>
                <P>(1) Be payable to BOEM upon demand; and</P>
                <P>(2) Guarantee compliance of all lessees, grant holders, operators, and payors with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant, any subsequent approvals and authorizations, and all applicable regulations.</P>
                <P>(b) All bonds and other forms of financial assurance must be on or in a form approved by BOEM. You may submit this on an approved form that you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If the document you submit omits any terms and conditions that are included on the BOEM-approved form, your bond is deemed to contain the omitted terms and conditions.</P>

                <P>(c) Surety bonds must be issued by an approved surety listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, as required by 31 CFR 223.16. You may obtain a copy of <PRTPAGE P="609"/>Circular 570 from the Treasury Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Your surety bond cannot exceed the underwriting limit listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, except as permitted therein.</P>
                <P>(e) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When the surety is a corporation, an authorized corporate officer must sign the bond and attest to it over the corporate seal.</P>
                <P>(f) You may not terminate the period of liability of your bond or cancel your bond, except as provided in this subpart. Bonds must continue in full force and effect even though an event has occurred that could diminish or terminate a surety's obligation under State law.</P>
                <P>(g) Your surety must notify you and BOEM within 5 business days after:</P>
                <P>(1) It initiates any judicial or administrative proceeding alleging its insolvency or bankruptcy; or</P>
                <P>(2) The Treasury decertifies the surety.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What instruments other than a surety bond may I use to meet the financial assurance requirement?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You may use other types of security instruments, if BOEM determines that such security protects BOEM to the same extent as the surety bond. BOEM will consider pledges of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) U.S. Department of Treasury securities identified in 31 CFR part 225;</P>
                <P>(2) Cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial assurance, to be deposited and maintained in a Federal depository account of the U.S. Treasury by BOEM;</P>
                <P>(3) Certificates of deposit or savings accounts in a bank or financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in the United States with:</P>
                <P>(i) Minimum net assets of $500,000,000; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Minimum Bankrate.com Safe &amp; Sound rating of 3 Stars, and Capitalization, Assets, Equity and Liquidity (CAEL) rating of 3 or less;</P>
                <P>(4) Negotiable U.S. Government, State, and municipal securities or bonds having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of the BOEM;</P>
                <P>(5) Investment-grade rated securities having a Standard and Poor's rating of AAA or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized securities rating service having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM; and</P>
                <P>(6) Insurance, if its form and function is such that the funding or enforceable pledges of funding are used to guarantee performance of regulatory obligations in the event of default on such obligations by the lessee. Insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “superior” or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized insurance rating service.</P>
                <P>(b) If you use a Treasury security:</P>
                <P>(1) You must post 115 percent of your financial assurance amount;</P>

                <P>(2) You must monitor the collateral value of your security. If the collateral value of your security as determined in accordance with the 31 CFR part 203 Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at <E T="03">http://www.treasurydirect.gov</E>) falls below the required level of coverage, you must pledge additional security to provide 115 percent of the required amount; and</P>
                <P>(3) You must include with your pledge authority for us to sell the security and use the proceeds if we determine that you have failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of your lease or grant, any subsequent approval or authorization, or applicable regulations.</P>
                <P>(c) If you use the instruments described in paragraphs (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, you must provide BOEM by the end of each calendar year a certified statement describing the nature and market value of the instruments maintained in that account, and including any current statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to the lessee concerning the asset value of the account.</P>

                <P>BOEM may allow you to use your financial strength and reliability to meet financial assurance requirements. We will make this determination based on audited financial statements, business stability, reliability, and compliance with regulations.</P>
                <P>(a) You must provide the following information if you want to demonstrate financial strength and reliability to meet your financial assurance requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) Audited financial statements (including auditor's certificate, balance sheet, and profit and loss sheet) that show you have financial capacity substantially in excess of existing and anticipated lease and other obligations;</P>
                <P>(2) Evidence that shows business stability based on 5 years of continuous operation and generation of renewable energy on the OCS or onshore;</P>
                <P>(3) Evidence that shows reliability in meeting obligations based on credit ratings or trade references, including names and addresses of other lessees, contractors, and suppliers with whom you have dealt; and</P>
                <P>(4) Evidence that shows a record of compliance with laws, regulations, and lease, ROW, or RUE terms.</P>
                <P>(b) If we approve your request to use your financial strength and reliability to meet your financial assurance requirements, you must submit annual updates to the information required by paragraph (a) of this section. You must submit this information no later than March 31 of each year.</P>
                <P>(c) If the annual updates to the information required by paragraph (a) of this section do not continue to demonstrate financial strength and reliability or BOEM has reason to believe that you are unable to meet the financial assurance requirements of this section, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, BOEM will terminate your ability to use financial strength and reliability for financial assurance and require you to provide another type of financial assurance. You must provide this new financial assurance instrument within 90 days after we terminate your use of financial strength and reliability.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May I use a third-party guaranty to meet the financial assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You may use a third-party guaranty if the guarantor meets the criteria prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and submits an agreement meeting the criteria prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must guarantee compliance with the obligations of all lessees and operators and grant holders.</P>
                <P>(b) BOEM will consider the following factors in deciding whether to accept an agreement:</P>
                <P>(1) The length of time that your guarantor has been in continuous operation as a business entity. You may exclude periods of interruption that are beyond the guarantor's control by demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Director, that the interruptions do not affect the likelihood of your guarantor remaining in business during the SAP, COP, and decommissioning stages of activities covered by the indemnity agreement.</P>
                <P>(2) Financial information available in the public record or submitted by your guarantor in sufficient detail to show us that your guarantor meets the criterion stated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Such detail includes:</P>

                <P>(ii) Your guarantor's net worth, taking into account liabilities for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease, regulations, and other guarantees;</P>
                <P>(iii) Your guarantor's ratio of current assets to current liabilities, taking into account liabilities for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease, regulations, and other guarantees; and</P>

                <P>(3) If the information in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not publicly available, your guarantor must submit the information in the following table, <PRTPAGE P="611"/>to be updated annually within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year (FY) or as otherwise prescribed.</P>

Such compliance must not reduce your guarantor's liability.</P>
                <P>(6) If your guarantor wants to terminate the period of liability, your guarantor must notify you and us at least 90 days before the proposed termination date, obtain our approval for termination of all or a specified portion of the guarantee for liabilities arising after that date, and remain liable for all your work performed during the period the agreement is in effect.</P>

                <P>(a) In lieu of a surety bond, BOEM may authorize you to establish a lease-, ROW grant-, or RUE grant-specific decommissioning account in a federally-insured institution. The funds may not be withdrawn from the account without our written approval.</P>
                <P>(1) The funds must be payable to BOEM and pledged to meet your lease or grant decommissioning and site clearance obligations; and</P>

                <P>(a) Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during which surety liability continues to accrue. The surety continues to be responsible for obligations and liabilities that accrued during the period of liability and before the date on which BOEM terminates the period of liability under paragraph (b) of this section. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include:</P>
                <P>(1) Obligations that started to accrue before the beginning of the period of liability and have not been met; and</P>
                <P>(2) Obligations that began accruing during the period of liability.</P>
                <P>(b) Your surety must submit to BOEM its request to terminate the period of liability under its bond and notify you of that request. If you intend to continue activities, or have not met all obligations of your lease or grant, you must provide a replacement bond or alternative form of financial assurance of equivalent or greater value. BOEM will terminate that period of liability within 90 days after BOEM receives the request.</P>

                <P>(a) BOEM will release a bond or allow a surety to cancel a bond, and will relieve the surety from accrued obligations only if:</P>
                <P>(1) BOEM determines that there are no outstanding obligations covered by the bond; or</P>
                <P>(2) The following occurs:</P>
                <P>(i) BOEM accepts a replacement bond or an alternative form of financial assurance in an amount equal to or greater than the bond to be cancelled to cover the terminated period of liability;</P>
                <P>(ii) The surety issuing the new bond has expressly agreed to assume all outstanding liabilities under the original bond that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The surety issuing the new bond has agreed to assume that portion of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the terminated period of liability that exceeds the coverage of the bond prescribed under §§ 585.515, 585.516, 585.520, or 585.521, and of which you were notified.</P>
                <P>(b) When your lease or grant ends, your surety(ies) remain(s) responsible, and BOEM will retain any financial assurance as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) The period of liability ends when you cease all operations and activities <PRTPAGE P="613"/>under the lease or grant, including decommissioning and site clearance;</P>
                <P>(2) Your surety or collateral financial assurance will not be released until 7 years after the lease ends, or a longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bonded obligation, or for BOEM to determine that all of your obligations under the lease or grant have been satisfied; and</P>
                <P>(3) BOEM will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your financial assurance if we determine that we need less than the full amount of the bond or financial assurance to meet any possible future obligations.</P>

              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 585.540</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How will BOEM equitably distribute revenues to States?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) BOEM will distribute among the eligible coastal States 27 percent of the following revenues derived from qualified projects, where a qualified project and qualified project area is determined in § 585.541 and an eligible State is determined in § 585.542, with each term defined in § 585.112. Revenues subject to distribution to eligible States include all bonuses, acquisition fees, rentals, and operating fees derived from the entire qualified project area and associated project easements not limited to revenues attributable to the portion of the project area within 3 miles of the seaward boundary of a coastal State. The revenues to be shared do not include administrative fees such as service fees and those assessed for civil penalties and forfeiture of bond or other surety obligations.</P>
                <P>(b) The project area is the area included within a single lease or grant. For each qualified project, BOEM will determine and announce the project area and its geographic center at the time it grants or issues a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the OCS. If a qualified project lease or grant's boundaries change significantly due to actions pursuant to §§ 585.435 or 585.436, BOEM will re-evaluate the project area to determine whether the geographic center has changed. If it has, BOEM will re-determine State eligibility and shares accordingly.</P>

                <P>(c) To determine each eligible State's share of the 27 percent of the revenues for a qualified project, BOEM will use the inverse distance formula, which apportions shares according to the relative proximity of the nearest point on the coastline of each eligible State to the geographic center of the qualified project area. If S<E T="52">i</E> is equal to the nearest distance from the geographic center of the project area to the i = 1, 2, * * * nth eligible State's coastline, then eligible State i would be entitled to the fraction F<E T="52">i</E> of the 27-percent aggregate revenue share due to all the eligible States according to the formula:
                </P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">F<E T="52">i</E>= (1/S<E T="52">i</E>) ÷ (Σ<E T="52">i=</E>1* * *<E T="52">n</E>(1/S<E T="52">i</E>)).</FP>

                <SUBJECT>What is a qualified project for revenue sharing purposes?</SUBJECT>
                <P>A qualified project for the purpose of revenue sharing with eligible coastal States is one authorized under subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act, which includes acreage within the area extending 3 nautical miles seaward of State submerged lands. A qualified project is subject to revenue sharing with those States that are eligible for revenue sharing under § 585.542. The entire area within a lease or grant for the qualified project, excluding project easements, is considered the qualified project area.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What makes a State eligible for payment of revenues?</SUBJECT>
                <P>A State is eligible for payment of revenues if any part of the State's coastline is located within 15 miles of the announced geographic center of the project area of a qualified project. A State is not eligible for revenue sharing if all parts of that State's coastline are more than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified project area. This is the case even if the qualified project area is located wholly or partially within an area extending 3 nautical miles seaward of the submerged lands of that State or if there are no States with a coastline less than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified project area.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 585.543</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Example of how the inverse distance formula works.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Assume that the geographic center of the project area lies 12 miles from the closest coastline point of State A and 4 miles from the closest coastline point of State B. BOEM will round dollar shares to the nearest whole dollar. The proportional share due each State would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) State A's share = [(<FR>1/12</FR>) ÷ (<FR>1/12</FR> + <FR>1/4</FR>)] = <FR>1/4</FR>.</P>
                <P>(2) State B's share = [(<FR>1/4</FR>) ÷ (<FR>1/12</FR> + <FR>1/4</FR>)] = <FR>3/4</FR>.</P>
                <P>(b) Therefore, State B would receive a share of revenues that is three times as large as that awarded to State A, based on the finding that State B's nearest coastline is one-third the distance to the geographic center of the qualified project area as compared to State A's nearest coastline. Eligible States share the 27 percent of the total revenues from the qualified project as mandated under the OCS Lands Act. Hence, if the qualified project generates $1,000,000 of Federal revenues in a given year, the Federal Government would distribute the States' 27-percent share as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) State A's share = $270,000 × <FR>1/4</FR> = $67,500.</P>
                <P>(2) State B's share = $270,000 × <FR>3/4</FR> = $202,500.</P>

                <P>(2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or</P>

We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing GAP or require a revision to your GAP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.</P>
                <P>(b) BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved GAP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your GAP. If the review indicates that the GAP should be revised to meet the requirement of this part, we will require you to submit the needed revisions.</P>
                <P>(c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your GAP will likely be necessary include:</P>
                <P>(1) Activities not described in your approved GAP;</P>

                <P>(6) Changes in the locations of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains, <E T="03">etc.</E>) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations. If a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision;</P>
                <P>(7) Structural failure of one or more facilities; or</P>
                <P>(8) Change to any other activity specified by BOEM.</P>
                <P>(d) We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and any relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:</P>
                <P>(1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;</P>
                <P>(2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or</P>
                <P>(3) Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.</P>
                <P>(e) When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:</P>
                <P>(1) Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and</P>

                <P>(a) Based upon your inclusion of all the information required by § 585.906, BOEM will compare your decommissioning application with the decommissioning general concept in your approved SAP, COP, or GAP to determine what technical and environmental reviews are needed.</P>

                <P>(b) You will likely have to revise your SAP, COP, or GAP, and BOEM <PRTPAGE P="647"/>will begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and other regulatory reviews as required, if BOEM determines that your decommissioning application would:</P>
                <P>(1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated in your SAP, COP, or GAP;</P>
                <P>(2) Require any additional Federal permits; or</P>
                <P>(3) Propose activities not previously identified and evaluated in your SAP, COP, or GAP.</P>
                <P>(c) During the review process, we may request additional information if we determine that the information provided is not sufficient to complete the review and approval process.</P>
                <P>(d) Upon completion of the technical and environmental reviews, we may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove your decommissioning application.</P>
                <P>(e) If BOEM disapproves your decommissioning application, you must resubmit your application to address the concerns identified by BOEM.</P>

                <P>(a) We will consider requests for an Alternate Use RUE on a case-by-case basis. In considering such requests, we will consult with relevant Federal agencies and evaluate whether the proposed activities involving the use of an existing OCS facility can be conducted in a manner that:</P>
                <P>(1) Ensures safety and minimizes adverse effects to the coastal and marine environments, including their physical, atmospheric, and biological components, to the extent practicable;</P>
                <P>(2) Does not inhibit or restrain orderly development of OCS mineral or energy resources; and</P>
                <P>(3) Avoids serious harm or damage to, or waste of, any natural resource (including OCS mineral deposits and oil, gas, and sulphur resources in areas leased or not leased), any life (including fish and other aquatic life), or property (including sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance);</P>
                <P>(4) Is otherwise consistent with subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act; and</P>
                <P>(5) BOEM can effectively regulate.</P>
                <P>(b) Based on the evaluation that we perform under paragraph (a) of this section, the BOEM may authorize or reject, or authorize with modifications or stipulations, the proposed activity.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What process will BOEM use for competitively offering an Alternate Use RUE?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An Alternate Use RUE must be issued on a competitive basis unless BOEM determines, after public notice of the proposed Alternate Use RUE, that there is no competitive interest.</P>
                <P>(b) We will issue a public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to determine if there is competitive interest in using the proposed facility for alternate use activities. BOEM will specify a time period for members of the public to express competitive interest.</P>
                <P>(c) If we receive indications of competitive interest within the published timeframe, we will proceed with a competitive offering. As part of such competitive offering, each competing applicant must submit a description of the types of activities proposed for the existing facility, as well as satisfactory evidence that the competing applicant qualifies to hold a lease or grant on the OCS, as required in §§ 585.106 and 585.107, by a date we specify. We may request additional information from competing applicants, as necessary, to adequately evaluate the competing proposals.</P>
                <P>(d) We will evaluate all competing proposals to determine whether:</P>
                <P>(1) The proposed activities are compatible with existing activities at the facility; and</P>
                <P>(2) We have the expertise and resources available to regulate the activities effectively.</P>
                <P>(e) We will evaluate all proposals under the requirements of NEPA, CZMA, and other applicable laws.</P>

                <P>(f) Following our evaluation, we will select one or more acceptable proposals for activities involving the alternate use of an existing OCS facility, notify the competing applicants, and submit each acceptable proposal to the lessee and owner of the existing OCS facility. If the lessee and owner of the facility agree to accept a proposal, we will proceed to issue an Alternate Use RUE. If <PRTPAGE P="650"/>the lessee and owner of the facility are unwilling to accept any of the proposals that we deem acceptable, we will not issue an Alternate Use RUE.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to explain the procedures for appeals of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) decisions and orders issued under subchapter C.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Who may appeal?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If you are adversely affected by an OMM official's final decision or order issued under 30 CFR chapter V, subchapter C, you may appeal that decision or order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA). Your appeal must conform with the procedures found in this subpart and 43 CFR part 4, subpart E. A request for reconsideration of a BOEM decision concerning a lease bid, authorized in 30 CFR parts 556.47(e)(3), 581.21(a)(1), or 585.118(c), is not subject to the procedures found in this part.</P>

              <P>You must file your appeal within 60 days after you receive OMM's final decision or order. The 60-day time period applies rather than the time period provided in 43 CFR 4.411(a). A decision or order is received on the date you sign a receipt confirming delivery or, if there is no receipt, the date otherwise documented.</P>

              <P>For your appeal to be filed, BOEM must receive all of the following within 60 days after you receive the decision or order:</P>
              <P>(a) A written Notice of Appeal together with a copy of the decision or order you are appealing in the office of the OEMM officer that issued the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and</P>
              <P>(b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of Appeal.</P>
              <P>(1) You must pay electronically through the <E T="03">Fees for Services</E> page on the BOEM Web site at <E T="03">http://www.boem.gov,</E> and you must include a copy of the <E T="03">Pay.gov</E> confirmation receipt page with your Notice of Appeal.</P>
              <P>(2) You cannot extend the 60-day period for payment of the processing fee.</P>

              <P>(a) You may seek informal resolution with the issuing officer's next level supervisor during the 60-day period established in § 590.3.</P>

              <P>(a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for filing an appeal under § 590.3 unless:</P>
              <P>(1) OMM notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any mineral deposit, or property; or</P>

              <P>(b) This section applies rather than 43 CFR 4.21(a) for appeals of OMM orders.</P>
              <P>(c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or order under appeal.</P>

              <P>(a) If you receive a decision or order issued under chapter V, subchapter C, you must appeal that decision or order to IBLA under 43 CFR part 4, subpart E, to exhaust administrative remedies.</P>
              <P>(b) This section does not apply if the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management or the IBLA makes a decision or order immediately effective notwithstanding an appeal.</P>
