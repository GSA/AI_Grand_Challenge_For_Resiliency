      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

            § 5.10
            Purpose and scope.
            This part establishes a system under which MSHA charges a fee for services provided. This part includes the management and calculation of fees for the approval program, which includes: Application processing, testing and evaluation, approval decisions, post-approval activities, and termination of approvals.
          
          
            § 5.30
            Fee calculation.
            (a) Fee calculation. MSHA charges a fee based on an hourly rate for Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) approval program activities and other associated costs, such as travel expenses and part 15 fees. Part 15 fees for services provided to MSHA by other organizations may be set by those organizations.
            (b) Hourly rate calculation. The hourly rate consists of direct and indirect costs of the A&CC's approval program divided by the number of direct hours worked on all approval program activities.
            (1) Direct costs are compensation and benefit costs for hours worked on approval program activities.
            (2) Indirect costs are a proportionate share of the following A&CC costs:
            (i) Compensation and benefit hours worked in support of all A&CC activities;
            (ii) A&CC building and equipment depreciation costs;
            (iii) A&CC utilities, facility and equipment maintenance, and supplies and materials; and
            (iv) Information Technology and other services the Department of Labor provides to the A&CC.
            (c) Fees are charged for—
            (1) Application processing (e.g., administrative and technical review of applications, computer tracking, and status reporting);
            (2) Testing and evaluation (e.g., analysis of drawings, technical evaluation, testing, test set up and test tear down, and internal quality control activities);
            (3) Approval decisions (e.g., consultation on applications, records control and security, document preparation); and
            (4) Two post-approval activities: changes to approvals and post-approval product audits.
            (d) Fees are not charged for—
            (1) Technical assistance not related to processing an approval application;
            (2) Technical programs, including development of new technology programs;
            (3) Participation in research conducted by other government agencies or private organizations; and
            (4) Regulatory review activities, including participation in the development of health and safety standards, regulations, and legislation.
            (e) Fee estimate. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, on completion of an initial administrative review of the application, the A&CC will prepare a maximum fee estimate for each application. A&CC will begin the technical evaluation after the applicant authorizes the fee estimate.
            (1) The applicant may pre-authorize an expenditure for services, and may further choose to pre-authorize either a maximum dollar amount or an expenditure without a specified maximum amount.

            (i) All applications containing a pre-authorization statement will be put in the queue for the technical evaluation on completion of an initial administrative review.
            
            (ii) MSHA will concurrently prepare a maximum fee estimate for applications containing a statement pre-authorizing a maximum dollar amount, and will provide the applicant with this estimate.
            (2) Where MSHA's estimated maximum fee exceeds the pre-authorized maximum dollar amount, the applicant has the choice of cancelling the action and paying for all work done up to the time of the cancellation, or authorizing MSHA's estimate.
            (3) Under the Revised Acceptance Modification Program (RAMP), MSHA expedites applications for acceptance of minor changes to previously approved, certified, accepted, or evaluated products. The applicant must pre-authorize a fixed dollar amount, set by MSHA, for processing the application.
            (f) If unforeseen circumstances are discovered during the evaluation, and MSHA determines that these circumstances would result in the actual costs exceeding either the pre-authorized expenditure or the authorized maximum fee estimate, as appropriate, MSHA will prepare a revised maximum fee estimate for completing the evaluation. The applicant will have the option of either cancelling the action and paying for services rendered or authorizing MSHA's revised estimate, in which case MSHA will continue to test and evaluate the product.
            (g) If the actual cost of processing the application is less than MSHA's maximum fee estimate, MSHA will charge the actual cost.
          
          
            § 5.40
            Fee administration.
            Applicants and approval holders will be billed for all fees, including actual travel expenses, if any, when approval program activities are completed. Invoices will contain specific payment instruction, including the address to mail payments and authorized methods of payment.
          
          
            § 5.50
            Fee revisions.
            The hourly rate will remain in effect for at least one year and be subject to revision at least once every three years.

            § 6.1
            Purpose and effective date.
            This part sets out alternate requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves for use in gassy underground mines. It permits manufacturers of certain products who seek MSHA approval to use an independent laboratory to perform, in whole or part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval. It also permits manufacturers to have their products approved based on non-MSHA product safety standards once MSHA has determined that the non-MSHA standards are equivalent to MSHA's applicable product approval requirements or can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements. The provisions of this part may be used by applicants for product approval under parts 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35, and 36. This rule is effective August 18, 2003.
          
          
            § 6.2
            Definitions.
            The following definitions apply in this part.

The definition is based on the existing definitions of “approval” in the parts specified above. It is expanded to include “certification” and “acceptance” because these terms also are used to denote MSHA approval.
            
            
              Approval holder. An applicant whose application for approval of a product under part 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35 or 36 of this chapter has been approved by MSHA.
            
              Equivalent non-MSHA product safety standards. A non-MSHA product safety standard, or group of standards, determined by MSHA to provide at least the same degree of protection as the applicable MSHA product approval requirements in parts 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35, and 36, or which in modified form provide at least the same degree of protection.
            
              Independent laboratory. A laboratory that:
            (1) has been recognized by a laboratory accrediting organization to test and evaluate products to a product safety standard, and
            (2) is free from commercial, financial, and other pressures that may influence the results of the testing and evaluation process.
            
              Post-approval product audit. The examination, testing, or both, by MSHA of approved products selected by MSHA to determine whether those products meet the applicable product approval requirements and have been manufactured as approved.
            
              Product safety standard. A document, or group of documents, that specifies the requirements for the testing and evaluation of a product for use in explosive gas and dust atmospheres, and, when appropriate, includes documents addressing the flammability properties of products.

            § 6.10
            Use of independent laboratories.
            (a) MSHA will accept testing and evaluation performed by an independent laboratory for purposes of MSHA product approval provided that MSHA receives as part of the application:
            (1) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
            (2) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
            (3) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and
            (4) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by the applicable part under this chapter.
            (b) Product testing and evaluation performed by independent laboratories for purposes of MSHA approval must comply with the applicable MSHA product approval requirements.
            (c) Product testing and evaluation must be conducted or witnessed by the laboratory's personnel.
            (d) After review of the information required under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, MSHA will notify the applicant if additional information or testing is required. The applicant must provide this information, arrange any additional or repeat tests and notify MSHA of the location, date, and time of the test(s). MSHA may observe any additional testing conducted by an independent laboratory. Further, MSHA may decide to conduct the additional or repeated tests at the applicant's expense. The applicant must supply any additional components necessary for testing and evaluation.
            (e) Upon request by MSHA, but not more than once a year, except for cause, approval holders of products approved based on independent laboratory testing and evaluation must make such products available for post-approval audit at a mutually agreeable site at no cost to MSHA.
            (f) Once the product is approved, the approval holder must notify MSHA of all product defects of which they become aware.

            MSHA acceptance of equivalent non-MSHA product safety standards.
            (a) MSHA will accept non-MSHA product safety standards, or groups of standards, as equivalent after determining that they:

            (1) Provide at least the same degree of protection as MSHA's product approval requirements in parts 14, 18, 19, 20, 33, 35 and 36 of this chapter; or
            
            (2) Can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements.

            (b) MSHA will publish its intent to review any non-MSHA product safety standard for equivalency in the Federal Register for the purpose of soliciting public input.
            (c) A listing of all equivalency determinations will be published in this part 6 and the applicable approval parts. The listing will state whether MSHA accepts the non-MSHA product safety standards in their original form, or whether MSHA will require modifications to demonstrate equivalency. If modifications are required, they will be provided in the listing. MSHA will notify the public of each equivalency determination and will publish a summary of the basis for its determination. MSHA will provide equivalency determination reports to the public upon request to the Approval and Certification Center.
            (d) After MSHA has determined that non-MSHA product safety standards are equivalent and has notified the public of such determinations, applicants may seek MSHA product approval based on such non-MSHA product safety standards.

              (a) MSHA will accept non-MSHA product safety standards, or groups of standards, as equivalent after determining that they:
              (1) Provide at least the same degree of protection as MSHA's applicable technical requirements for a product in the subparts of this part; or
              (2) Can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements.

              (b) MSHA will publish its intent to review any non-MSHA product safety standard for equivalency in the Federal Register for the purpose of soliciting public input.

              (c) A listing of all equivalency determinations will be published in this part 7. The listing will state whether MSHA accepts the non-MSHA product safety standards in their original form, or whether MSHA will require modifications to demonstrate equivalency. If modifications are required, they will be provided in the listing. MSHA will notify the public of each equivalency determination and will publish a summary of the basis for its determination. MSHA will provide equivalency determination reports to the public upon request to the Approval and Certification Center. MSHA has made the following equivalency determinations applicable to this part 7.
              

              (1) MSHA will accept applications for motors under Subpart J designed and tested to the International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) standards for Electrical Apparatus for Explosive Gas Atmospheres, Part 0, General Requirements (IEC 60079-0, Fourth Edition, 2004-01) and Part 1, Electrical Apparatus for Explosive Gas Atmospheres, Flameproof Enclosures “d” (IEC 60079-1, Fifth Edition, 2003-11) (which are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof) provided the modifications to the IEC standards specified in § 7.10(c)(1)(i) through (ix) are met. The Director of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The IEC standards may be inspected at the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Electrical Safety Division, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. These IEC standards may be obtained from International Electrical Commission, Central Office 3, rue de Varembé, P.O. Box 131, CH-1211 GENEVA 20, Switzerland.
              (i) Enclosures associated with an electric motor assembly shall be made of metal and not have a compartment exceeding ten (10) feet in length. External surfaces of enclosures shall not exceed 150 °C (302 °F) in normal operation.
              (ii) Enclosures shall be rugged in construction and should meet existing requirements for minimum bolt size and spacing and for minimum wall, cover, and flange thicknesses specified in paragraph (g)(19) of § 7.304 Technical requirements. Enclosure fasteners should be uniform in size and length, be provided at all corners, and be secured from loosening by lockwashers or equivalent. An engineering analysis shall be provided for enclosure designs that deviate from the existing requirements. The analysis shall show that the proposed enclosure design meets or exceeds the mechanical strength of a comparable enclosure designed to 150 psig according to existing requirements, and that flamepath clearances in excess of existing requirements will not be produced at an internal pressure of 150 psig. This shall be verified by explosion testing the enclosure at a minimum of 150 psig.
              (iii) Enclosures shall be designed to withstand a minimum pressure of at least 150 psig without leakage through any welds or castings, rupture of any part that affects explosion-proof integrity, clearances exceeding those permitted under existing requirements along flame-arresting paths, or permanent distortion exceeding 0.040-inch per linear foot.
              (iv) Flamepath clearances, including clearances between fasteners and the holes through which they pass, shall not exceed those specified in existing requirements. No intentional gaps in flamepaths are permitted.
              (v) The minimum lengths of the flame arresting paths, based on enclosure volume, shall conform to those specified in existing requirements to the nearest metric equivalent value (e.g., 12.5 mm, 19 mm, and 25 mm are considered equivalent to 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch and 1 inch respectively for plane and cylindrical joints). The widths of any grooves for o-rings shall be deducted in measuring the widths of flame-arresting paths.
              (vi) Gaskets shall not be used to form any part of a flame-arresting path. If o-rings are installed within a flamepath, the location of the o-rings shall meet existing requirements.
              (vii) Cable entries into enclosures shall be of a type that utilizes either flame-resistant rope packing material or sealing rings (grommets). If plugs and mating receptacles are mounted to an enclosure wall, they shall be of explosion-proof construction. Insulated bushings or studs shall not be installed in the outside walls of enclosures. Lead entrances utilizing sealing compounds and flexible or rigid metallic conduit are not permitted.
              (viii) Unused lead entrances shall be closed with a metal plug that is secured by spot welding, brazing, or equivalent.

              (ix) Special explosion tests are required for electric motor assemblies that share leads (electric conductors) through a common wall with another explosion-proof enclosure, such as a motor winding compartment and a conduit box. These tests are required to determine the presence of any pressure piling conditions in either enclosure when one or more of the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts are sequentially removed from the common wall between the enclosures. Enclosures that exhibit pressures during these tests that exceed those specified in existing requirements must be provided with a warning tag. The durable warning tag must indicate that the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts be maintained in order to insure the explosion-proof integrity for either enclosure sharing a common wall. A warning tag is not required if the enclosures withstand a static pressure of twice the maximum value observed in the explosion tests.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (d) After MSHA has determined that non-MSHA product safety standards are equivalent and has notified the public of such determinations, applicants may seek MSHA product approval based on such non-MSHA product safety standards.

              § 7.26
              Flame test apparatus.
              The principal parts of the apparatus used to test for flame-resistance of brattice cloth and ventilation tubing shall be constructed as follows:
              (a) A 16-gauge stainless steel gallery lined on the top, bottom and both sides with 1/2 inch thick Marinite or equivalent insulating material yielding inside dimensions approximately 58 inches long, 41 inches high, and 30 inches wide;
              (b) Two 3/8-inch diameter steel J hooks and a 9/16-inch diameter steel rod to support the sample located approximately 23/16-inches from the front and back ends of the test gallery, 11/2-inches from the ceiling insulation and centrally located in the gallery along its length. Samples shall be suspended to preclude folds or wrinkles;
              (c) A tapered 16-gauge stainless steel duct section tapering from a cross sectional area measuring 2 feet 7 inches wide by 3 feet 6 inches high at the test gallery to a cross-sectional area 1 foot 6 inches square over a length of 3 feet. The tapered duct section must be tightly connected to the test gallery;
              (d) A 16-gauge stainless steel fan housing, consisting of a 1 foot 6 inches square section 6 inches long followed by a 10 inch long section which tapers from 1 foot 16 inches square to 12 inches diameter round and concluding with a 12 inch diameter round collar 3 inches long. A variable speed fan capable of producing an air velocity of 125 ft./min. in the test gallery must be secured in the fan housing. The fan housing must be tightly connected to the tapered duct section;
              (e) A methane-fueled impinged jet burner igniting source, measuring 12 inches long from the threaded ends of the first and last jets and 4 inches wide with 12 impinged jets, approximately 13/8-inches long and spaced alternately along the length of the burner tube. The burner jets must be canted so that they point toward each other in pairs and the flame from these pairs impinge upon each other.
            
            
              § 7.27
              Test for flame resistance of brattice cloth.
              (a) Test procedures. (1) Prepare 6 samples of brattice cloth 40 inches wide by 48 inches long.
              (2) Prior to testing, condition each sample for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21 ±5.5 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ±10%.
              (3) For each test, suspend the sample in the gallery by wrapping the brattice cloth around the rod and clamping each end and the center. The brattice cloth must hang 4 inches from the gallery floor.

              (4) Use a front exhaust system to remove smoke escaping from the gallery. The exhaust system must remain on during all testing, but not affect the air flow in the gallery.
              
              (5) Set the methane-fueled impinged jet burner to yield a flame height of 12 inches as measured at the outermost tip of the flame.
              (6) Apply the burner to the front lower edge of the brattice cloth and keep it in contact with the material for 25 seconds or until 1 foot of material, measured horizontally, is consumed, whichever occurs first. If the material shrinks during application of the burner flame, move the burner flame to maintain contact with 1 foot of the material. If melting material might clog the burner orifices, rotate the burner slightly during application of the flame.
              (7) Test 3 samples in still air and 3 samples with an average of 125 ft./min. of air flowing past the sample.
              (8) Record the propagation length and duration of burning for each of the 6 samples. The duration of burning is the total burning time of the specimen during the flame test. This includes the burn time of any material that falls on the floor of the test gallery during the igniting period. However, the suspended specimen is considered burning only after the burner is removed. Should the burning time of a suspended specimen and a specimen on the floor coincide, count the coinciding burning time only once.
              (9) Calculate the average duration of burning for the first 3 samples (still air) and the second 3 samples (125 ft./min. air flow).
              (b) Acceptable performance. The brattice cloth shall meet each of the following criteria:
              (1) Flame propagation of less than 4 feet in each of the six tests.
              (2) An average duration of burning of less than 1 minute in both groups of three tests.
              (3) A duration of burning not exceeding two minutes in each of the six tests.

              Test for flame resistance of rigid ventilation tubing.
              (a) Test procedures. (1) Prepare 6 samples of ventilation tubing 48 inches in length with all flared or thickened ends removed. Any sample with a cross-sectional dimension greater than 24 inches must be tested in a 24-inch size.
              (2) For each test, suspend the sample in the center of the gallery by running a wire through the 48-inch length of tubing.
              (3) Use a front exhaust system to remove smoke escaping from the gallery. The exhaust system must remain on during all testing but not affect the air flow in the gallery.
              (4) Set the methane-fueled impinged jet burner to yield a flame height of 12 inches as measured at the outermost tip of the flame.
              (5) Apply the burner to the front lower edge of the tubing so that two-thirds of the burner is under the tubing and the remaining third is exposed to allow the flames to curl onto the inside of the tubing. Keep the burner in contact with the material for 60 seconds. If melting material might clog the burner orifices, rotate the burner slightly during application of the flame.
              (6) Test 3 samples in still air and 3 samples with an average of 125 ft./min. of air flowing past the sample.
              (7) Record the propagation length and duration of burning for each of the 6 samples. The duration of burn is the total burning time of the specimen during the flame test. This includes the burning time of any material that falls on the floor of the test gallery during the igniting period.

The heat transfer medium must be a liquid which will not chemically affect the sample. The testing apparatus must be constructed so that expansion of any components during heating of the medium does not result in deflection of the sample.
              (3) Place a temperature measuring device with an accuracy of 1% into the heat transfer medium within 1/8 inch of, but not touching, the sample.
              (4) Apply a total load, in pounds, numerically equivalent to 11 times the thickness of the sample, in inches, to the sample midway between the supports using a 1/8 inch radius, rounded contact. The total load includes that weight used to apply the load and any force exerted by the deflection measurement device.
              (5) Use a deflection measuring device with an accuracy of ±.001 inches to measure the deflection of the sample at the point of loading as the temperature of the medium is increased at a uniform rate of 3.6 ±.36 °F/min. (2 ±0.2 °C/min.). Apply the load to the sample for 5 minutes prior to heating, to allow compensation for creep in the sample due to the loading.

              § 7.100
              Explosion tests.
              (a) Test procedures. (1) Prepare to test the diesel power package as follows:
              (i) Perform a detailed check of parts against the drawings and specifications submitted under § 7.97 to determine that the parts and drawings agree.
              (ii) Remove all parts that do not contribute to the operation or ensure the explosion-proof integrity of the diesel power package such as the air cleaner and exhaust gas dilution system.
              (iii) Fill coolant system fluid and engine oil to the engine manufacturer's recommended levels.
              (iv) Interrupt fuel supply to the injector pump.
              (v) Establish a preliminary low water level for systems using the wet exhaust conditioner as a flame arrester.
              (2) Perform static and dynamic tests of the intake system as follows:
              (i) Install the diesel power package in an explosion test chamber which is large enough to contain the complete diesel power package. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the flammable mixture surrounding the diesel power package. Couple the diesel power package to an auxiliary drive mechanism. Attach a pressure measuring device, a temperature measuring device, and an ignition source to the intake system. The pressure measuring device shall be capable of indicating the peak pressure accurate to ±1 pound-per-square inch gauge (psig) at 100 psig static pressure and shall have a frequency response of 40 Hertz or greater. The ignition source shall be an electric spark with a minimum energy of 100 millijoules. The ignition source shall be located immediately adjacent to the intake manifold and the pressure and temperature devices shall be located immediately adjacent to the flame arrester.
              (ii) For systems using the wet exhaust conditioner as an exhaust flame arrester, fill the exhaust conditioner to the specified high or normal operating water level.
              (iii) Fill the test chamber with a mixture of natural gas and air or methane and air. If natural gas is used, the content of combustible hydrocarbons shall total at least 98.0 percent, by volume, with the remainder being inert. At least 80.0 percent, by volume, of the gas shall be methane. For all tests, the methane or natural gas concentration shall be 8.5 ±1.8 percent, by volume, and the oxygen concentration shall be no less than 18 percent, by volume.
              (iv) Using the auxiliary drive mechanism, motor the engine to fill the intake and exhaust systems with the flammable mixture. The intake system, exhaust system, and test chamber gas concentration shall not differ by more than ±0.3 percent, by volume, at the time of ignition.

              (v) For static tests, stop the engine, actuate the ignition source, and observe the peak pressure. The peak pressure shall not exceed 110 psig. If the peak pressure exceeds 110 psig, construction changes shall be made that result in a reduction of pressure to 110 psig or less, or the system shall be tested in accordance with the static pressure test of § 7.104 with the pressure parameter replaced with a static pressure of twice the highest value recorded.
              (vi) If the peak pressure does not exceed 110 psig or if the system meets the static pressure test requirements of this section and there is no discharge of visible flames or glowing particles or ignition of the flammable mixture in the chamber, a total of 20 tests shall be conducted in accordance with the explosion test specified above.
              (vii) For dynamic tests, follow the same procedures for static tests, except actuate the ignition source while motoring the engine. Forty dynamic tests shall be conducted at two speeds, twenty at 1800 ±200 RPM and twenty at 1000 ±200 RPM. Under some circumstances, during dynamic testing the flammable mixture may continue to burn within the diesel power package after ignition. This condition can be recognized by the presence of a rumbling noise and a rapid increase in temperature. This can cause the flame-arrester to reach temperatures which can ignite the surrounding flammable mixture. Ignition of the flammable mixture in the test chamber under these circumstances does not constitute failure of the flame arrester. However; if this condition is observed, the test operator should immediately stop the engine and allow components to cool to prevent damage to the components.
              (3) Perform static and dynamic tests of the exhaust system as follows:
              (i) Prepare the diesel power package for explosion tests according to § 7.100(a)(2)(i) as follows:
              (A) Install the ignition source immediately adjacent to the exhaust manifold.
              (B) Install pressure measuring devices in each segment as follows: immediately adjacent to the exhaust conditioner inlet; in the exhaust conditioner; and immediately adjacent to the flame arrester, if applicable.
              (C) Install a temperature device immediately adjacent to the exhaust conditioner inlet.
              (ii) If the exhaust system is provided with a spaced-plate flame arrester in addition to an exhaust conditioner, explosion tests of the exhaust system shall be performed as described for the intake system in accordance with this section. Water shall not be present in a wet exhaust conditioner for the tests.
              (iii) If the wet exhaust conditioner is used as the exhaust flame arrester, explosion testing of this type of system shall be performed as described for the intake system in accordance with this section with the following modifications:
              (A) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at 2 inches below the minimum allowable low water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be opened. These openings may include lines which connect the reserve water supply to the wet exhaust conditioner, insert flanges, float flanges, and cover plates. These entrances are opened during this test to verify that they are not flame paths.
              (B) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at 2 inches below the minimum allowable low water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner (except the exhaust conditioner outlet) which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be closed. These openings are closed to simulate normal operation.
              (C) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at the specified high or normal operating water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be opened.
              (D) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at the specified high or normal operating water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner (except the exhaust conditioner outlet) which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be closed.

              (iv) After successful completion of the explosion tests of the exhaust system, the minimum allowable low water level, for a wet exhaust conditioner used as the exhaust flame arrester, shall be determined by adding two inches to the lowest water level that passed the explosion tests.
              (v) A determination shall be made of the maximum grade on which the wet exhaust conditioner can be operated retaining the flame-arresting characteristics.
              (b) Acceptable performance. The explosion tests shall not result in any of the following—
              (1) Discharge of flame or glowing particles.
              (2) Visible discharge of gas through gasketed joints.
              (3) Ignition of the flammable mixture in the test chamber.
              (4) Rupture of any part that affects the explosion-proof integrity.
              (5) Clearances, in excess of those specified in this subpart, along accessible flame-arresting paths, following any necessary retightening of fastenings.
              (6) Pressure exceeding 110 psig, unless the intake system or exhaust system has withstood a static pressure of twice the highest value recorded in the explosion tests of this section following the static pressure test procedures of § 7.104.

              § 7.306
              Explosion tests.
              (a) The following shall be used for conducting an explosion test:

              (1) An explosion test chamber designed and constructed to contain an explosive gas mixture to surround and fill the motor assembly being tested. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the explosive mixture surrounding the motor assembly.
              (2) A methane gas supply with at least 98 by volume per centum of combustible hydrocarbons, with the remainder being inert. At least 80 percent by volume of the gas shall be methane.
              (3) Coal dust having a minimum of 22 percent dry volatile matter and a minimum heat constant of 11,000 moist BTU (coal containing natural bed moisture but not visible surface water) ground to a fineness of minus 200 mesh U.S. Standard sieve series.
              (4) An electric spark ignition source with a minimum of 100 millijoules of energy.
              (5) A pressure recording system that will indicate the pressure peaks resulting from the ignition and combustion of explosive gas mixtures within the enclosure being tested.
              (b) General test procedures. (1) Motor assemblies being tested shall—
              (i) Be equipped with unshielded bearings regardless of the type of bearings specified; and
              (ii) Have all parts that do not contribute to the operation or assure the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure, such as oil seals, grease fittings, hose conduit, cable clamps, and outer bearing caps (which do not house the bearings) removed from the motor assembly.
              (2) Each motor assembly shall be placed in the explosion test chamber and tested as follows:
              (i) The motor assembly shall be filled with and surrounded by an explosive mixture of the natural gas supply and air. The chamber gas concentrations shall be between 6.0 by volume per centum and the motor assembly natural gas concentration just before ignition of each test. Each externally visible flame-arresting path fit shall be observed for discharge of flames for at least two of the tests, including one with coal dust added.
              (ii) A single spark source is used for all testing. Pressure shall be measured at each end of the winding compartment simultaneously during all tests. Quantity and location of test holes shall permit ignition on each end of the winding compartment and recording of pressure on the same and opposite ends as the ignition.
              (iii) Motor assemblies incorporating a conduit box shall have the pressure in the conduit box recorded simultaneously with the other measured pressures during all tests. Quantity and location of test holes in the conduit box shall permit ignition and recording of pressure as required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4)(i) of this section.
              (iv) The motor assembly shall be completely purged and recharged with a fresh explosive gas mixture from the chamber or by injection after each test. The chamber shall be completely purged and recharged with a fresh explosive gas mixture as necessary. The oxygen level of the chamber gas mixture shall be no less than 18 percent by volume for testing. In the absence of oxygen monitoring equipment, the maximum number of tests conducted before purging shall be less than or equal to the chamber volume divided by forty times the volume occupied by the motor assembly.
              (c) Test procedures. (1) Eight tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume within the winding compartment shall be conducted, with the rotor stationary during four tests and rotating at rated speed (rpm) during four tests. The ignition shall be at one end of the winding compartment for two stationary and two rotating tests, and then switched to the opposite end for the remaining four tests. If a nonisolated conduit box is used, then two additional tests, one stationary and one rotating, shall be conducted with ignition in the conduit box at a point furthest away from the opening between the conduit box and the winding compartment.
              (2) Four tests at 7.0 ±0.3 percent methane by volume within the winding compartment shall be conducted with the rotor stationary, 2 ignitions at each end.

              (3) Four tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume plus coal dust shall be conducted. A quantity of coal dust equal to 0.05 ounces per cubic foot of internal free volume of the winding compartment plus the nonisolated conduit box shall be introduced into each end of the winding compartment and nonisolated conduit box to coat the interior surface before conducting the first of the four tests. The coal dust introduced into the conduit box shall be proportional to its volume. The remaining coal dust shall be equally divided between the winding compartment ends. For two tests, one stationary and one rotating, the ignition shall be either in the conduit box or one end of the connected winding compartment, whichever produced the highest pressure in the previous tests. The two remaining tests, one stationary and one rotating, shall be conducted with the ignition in the winding compartment end furthest away from the conduit box.
              (4) For motor assemblies incorporating a conduit box which is isolated from the winding compartment by an isolating barrier the following additional tests shall be conducted—
              (i) For conduit boxes with an internal free volume greater than 150 cubic inches, two ignition points shall be used, one as close to the geometric center of the conduit box as practical and the other at the furthest point away from the isolating barrier between the conduit box and the winding compartment. Recording of pressure shall be on the same and opposite sides as the ignition point furthest from the isolating barrier between the conduit box and the winding compartment. Conduit boxes with an internal free volume of 150 cubic inches or less shall have one test hole for ignition located as close to the geometric center of the conduit box as practical and one for recording of pressure located on a side of the conduit box.
              (ii) The conduit box shall be tested separately. Six tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume within the conduit box shall be conducted followed by two tests at 7.0 ±0.3 percent methane by volume. Then two tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume with a quantity of coal dust equal to 0.05 ounces per cubic foot of internal free volume of the conduit box and meeting the specifications in paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be conducted. For conduit boxes with an internal free volume of more than 150 cubic inches, the number of tests shall be evenly divided between each ignition point.
              (iii) The motor assembly shall be tested following removal of the isolating barrier or one sectionalizing terminal (as applicable). Six tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume in the winding compartment and conduit box shall be conducted using three ignition locations. The ignition shall be at one end of the winding compartment for one stationary and one rotating test; the opposite end for one stationary and one rotating test; and at the ignition point that produced the highest pressure on the previous test in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in the conduit box for one stationary and one rotating test. Motor assemblies that use multiple sectionalizing terminals shall have one test conducted as each additional terminal is removed. Each of these tests shall use the rotor state and ignition location that produced the highest pressure in the previous tests.
              (d) A motor assembly incorporating a conduit box that is isolated from the winding compartment that exhibits pressures exceeding 110 psig, while testing during removal of any or all isolating barriers as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, shall have a warning statement on the approval plate. This statement shall warn that the isolating barrier must be maintained to ensure the explosion-proof integrity of the motor assembly. A statement is not required when the motor assembly has withstood a static pressure of twice the maximum pressure recorded in the explosion tests of paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The static pressure test shall be conducted on the motor assembly with all isolating barriers removed, and in accordance with § 7.307 of this part.
              (e) Acceptable performance. Explosion tests of a motor assembly shall not result in—
              (1) Discharge of flames.
              (2) Ignition of the explosive mixture surrounding the motor assembly in the chamber.
              (3) Development of afterburning.
              
              (4) Rupture of any part of the motor assembly or any panel or divider within the motor assembly.
              (5) Clearances, in excess of those specified in this subpart, along accessible flame-arresting paths, following any necessary retightening of fastenings.
              (6) Pressure exceeding 110 psig, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section unless the motor assembly has withstood a static pressure of twice the maximum pressure recorded in the explosion tests of this section following the static pressure test procedures of § 7.307 of this part.
              (7) Permanent deformation greater than 0.040 inches per linear foot.

              (b) Acceptable performance. (1) The enclosure during pressurization shall not exhibit—
              (i) Leakage through welds or casting; or
              (ii) Rupture of any part that affects the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure.
              (2) The enclosure following removal of the pressurizing agent shall not exhibit—
              (i) Visible cracks in welds;
              (ii) Permanent deformation exceeding 0.040 inches per linear foot; or
              (iii) Clearances, in excess of those specified in this subpart, along accessible flame-arresting paths, following any necessary retightening of fastenings.

              Lockwasher equivalency test.
              (a) Test procedure. (1) Each test sample shall be an assembly consisting of a fastening with a locking device. Each standard sample shall be an assembly consisting of a fastening with a lockwasher.
              (2) Five standard samples and five test samples shall be tested.
              (3) Each standard and test sample shall use a new fastening of the same specifications as being used on the motor assembly.
              (4) A new tapped hole shall be used for each standard and test sample. The hole shall be of the same specifications as used on the motor assembly.
              (5) Each standard and test sample shall be inserted in the tapped hole and continuously and uniformly tightened at a speed not to exceed 30 rpm until the fastening's proof load is achieved. The torquing device shall not contact the locking device or the threaded portion of the fastening.
              (6) Each standard and test sample shall be engaged and disengaged for 15 full cycles.

The current source shall have a means to regulate current flow through the test specimen and have an open circuit voltage not exceeding the voltage rating of the test specimen.
              (e) Current measuring device. (For electric cables and splices only). An instrument to monitor the effective value of heating current flow through the power conductors of the specimen within an accuracy of ±1 percent.
              (f) Temperature measuring device. (For electric cables and splices only). An instrument to measure conductor temperature within an accuracy of ±2 percent without the necessity of removing material from the test specimen in order to measure the temperature.
            
            
              § 7.407
              Test for flame resistance of electric cables and cable splices.
              (a) Test procedure. (1) For electric cables, prepare 3 specimens of cable, each 3 feet in length, by removing 5 inches of jacket material and 21/2 inches of conductor insulation from both ends of each test specimen. For splices, prepare a splice specimen in each of 3 sections of MSHA-approved flame-resistant cable. The cable shall be of the type that the splice kit is designed to repair. The finished splice shall not exceed 18 inches or be less than 6 inches in length for test purposes. The spliced cables shall be 3 feet in length with the midpoint of the splice located 14 inches from one end. Both ends of each of the spliced cables shall be prepared by removing 5 inches of jacket material and 21/2 inches of conductor insulation. The type, amperage, voltage rating, and construction of the cable shall be compatible with the splice kit design. Each splice shall be made in accordance with the instructions provided with the splice kit.
              (2) Prior to testing, condition each test specimen for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21.1 ±5.5 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ±10 percent. These environmental conditions shall be maintained during testing.
              (3) For electric cables, locate the sensing element of the temperature measuring device 26 inches from one end of each test specimen. For splices, locate the sensing element 12 inches from the midpoint of the splice and 10 inches from the end of the cable. The sensing element must be secured so that it remains in direct contact with the metallic portion of the power conductor for the duration of the flame-resistant test. If a thermocouple-type temperature measuring instrument is used, connect the sensing element through the cable jacket and power conductor insulation. Other means for monitoring conductor temperature may be used, provided the temperature measurement is made at the same location. If the jacket and conductor insulation must be disturbed to insert the temperature measuring device, each must be restored as closely as possible to its original location and maintained there for the duration of the testing.

              (4) Center the test specimen horizontally in the test chamber on the three rods. The three rods shall be positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the test specimen and at the same height, which permits the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner, when adjusted in accordance with the test procedure, to touch the jacket of the test specimen. The specimen shall be maintained at this level for the duration of the flame test. The two outermost rods shall be placed so that 1 inch of cable jacket extends beyond each rod. For electric cables, the third rod shall be placed 14 inches from the end of the test specimen nearer the temperature monitoring location on the specimen. For splices, the third rod shall be placed between the splice and the temperature monitoring location at a distance 8 inches from the midpoint of the splice. The specimen shall be free from external air currents during testing.
              (5) Adjust the gas burner to give an overall blue flame 5 inches high with a 3-inch inner cone. There shall be no persistence of yellow coloration.
              (6) Connect all power conductors of the test specimen to the current source. The connections shall be secure and compatible with the size of the cable's power conductors in order to reduce contact resistance.
              (7) Energize all power conductors of the test specimen with an effective heating current value of 5 times the power conductor ampacity rating (to the nearest whole ampere) at an ambient temperature of 104 °F (40 °C).
              (8) Monitor the electric current through the power conductors of the test specimen with the current measuring device. Adjust the amount of heating current, as required, to maintain the proper effective heating current value within ±5 percent until the power conductors reach a temperature of 400 °F (204.4 °C).
              (9) For electric cables, apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner directly beneath the test specimen for 60 seconds at a location 14 inches from one end of the cable and between the supports separated by a 16-inch distance. For splices, apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of a gas burner for 60 seconds beneath the midpoint of the splice jacket.
              (10) After subjecting the test specimen to external flame for the specified time, fully remove the flame of the gas from beneath the specimen without disturbing air currents within the test chamber. Simultaneously turn off the heating current.
              (11) Record the amount of time the test specimen continues to burn after the flame from the gas burner has been removed. The duration of burning includes the burn time of any material that falls from the test specimen after the flame from the gas has been removed.
              (12) Record the length of burned (charred) area of each test specimen measured longitudinally along the cable axis.
              (13) Repeat the procedure for the remaining two specimens.
              (b) Acceptable performance. Each of the three test specimens shall meet the following criteria:
              (1) The duration of burning shall not exceed 240 seconds.
              (2) The length of the burned (charred) area shall not exceed 6 inches.
            
            
              § 7.408

              (a) Test procedure. (1) Prepare 3 samples of cable each 2 feet long.
              (2) Prior to testing, condition each test specimen for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21.1 ±5.5 °C) and relative humidity of 55 ±10 percent. These environmental conditions shall be maintained during testing.
              (3) Center the test specimen horizontally in the test chamber on the three rods. The three rods shall be positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the test specimen and at the same height, which permits the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner, when adjusted in accordance with the test procedure, to touch the test specimen. The specimen shall be maintained at this height for the duration of the flame test. The two outermost rods shall be placed so that 1 inch of cable extends beyond each rod. The third rod shall be placed at the midpoint of the cable. The specimen shall be free from external air currents during testing.
              (4) Adjust the gas burner to give an overall blue flame 5 inches high with a 3-inch inner cone. There shall be no persistence of yellow coloration.
              (5) Apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner for 30 seconds directly beneath the specimen centered between either and support and the center support.
              (6) After subjecting the test specimen to external flame for the specified time, fully remove the flame of the gas from beneath the specimen without disturbing air currents within the test chamber.

              (7) Record the amount of time the test specimen continues to burn after the flame from the gas burner has been removed. The duration of burning includes the burn time of any material that falls from the test specimen after the flame from the gas has been removed.
              (8) Record the length of burned (charred) area of each test specimen measured longitudinally along the cable axis.
              (9) Repeat the procedure for the remaining two specimens.

              § 14.22
              Test for flame resistance of conveyor belts.
              (a) Test procedures. The test must be conducted in the following sequence using a flame test apparatus meeting the specifications of § 14.21:
              (1) Lay three samples of the belt, 60 ±1/4 inches (152.4 ±0.6 cm) long by 9 ±1/8 inches (22.9 ±0.3 cm) wide, flat at a temperature of 70 ±10 °Fahrenheit (21 ±5 °Centigrade) for at least 24 hours prior to the test;
              (2) For each of three tests, place one belt sample with the load-carrying surface facing up on the rails of the rack so that the sample extends 1 ±1/8 inch (2.5 ±0.3 cm) beyond the front of the rails and 1 ±1/8 inch (2.5 ±0.3 cm) from the outer lengthwise edge of each rail;
              (3) Fasten the sample to the rails of the rack with steel washers and cotter pins. The cotter pins shall extend at least 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) below the rails. Equivalent fasteners may be used. Make a series of 5 holes approximately 9/32 inch (0.7 cm) in diameter along both edges of the belt sample, starting at the first rail hole within 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the front edge of the sample. Make the next hole 5 ±1/4 inches (12.7 ±0.6 cm) from the first, the third hole 5 ±1/4 inches (12.7 ±0.6 cm) from the second, the fourth hole approximately midway along the length of the sample, and the fifth hole near the end of the sample. After placing a washer over each sample hole, insert a cotter pin through the hole and spread it apart to secure the sample to the rail;
              (4) Center the rack and sample in the test chamber with the front end of the sample 6 ±1/2 inches (15.2 ±1.27 cm) from the entrance;
              (5) Measure the airflow with a 4-inch (10.2 cm) diameter vane anemometer, or an equivalent device, placed on the centerline of the belt sample 12 ±1/2 inches (30.5 ±1.27 cm) from the chamber entrance. Adjust the airflow passing through the chamber to 200 ±20 ft/min (61 ±6 m/min);
              (6) Before starting the test on each sample, the inner surface temperature of the chamber roof measured at points 6 ±1/2, 30 ±1/2, and 60 ±1/2 inches (15.2 ±1.27, 76.2 ±1.27, and 152.4 ±1.27 cm) from the front entrance of the chamber must not exceed 95 °Fahrenheit (35 °Centigrade) at any of these points with the specified airflow passing through the chamber. The temperature of the air entering the chamber during the test on each sample must not be less than 50 °Fahrenheit (10 °Centigrade);
              (7) Center the burner in front of the sample's leading edge with the plane, defined by the tips of the burner jets, 3/4 ±1/8 inch (1.9 ±0.3 cm) from the front edge of the belt;
              (8) With the burner lowered away from the sample, set the gas flow at 1.2 ±0.1 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) (34 ±2.8 liters per minute) and then ignite the gas burner. Maintain the gas flow to the burner throughout the 5 to 5.1 minute ignition period;
              (9) After applying the burner flame to the front edge of the sample for a 5 to 5.1 minute ignition period, lower the burner away from the sample and extinguish the burner flame;
              (10) After completion of each test, determine the undamaged portion across the entire width of the sample. Blistering without charring does not constitute damage.
              (b) Acceptable performance. Each tested sample must exhibit an undamaged portion across its entire width.
              (c) MSHA may modify the procedures of the flammability test for belts constructed of thicknesses more than 3/4 inch (1.9 cm).
            
            
              § 14.23
              New technology.
              MSHA may approve a conveyor belt that incorporates technology for which the requirements of this part are not applicable if the Agency determines that the conveyor belt is as safe as those which meet the requirements of this part.

            Subpart B—Requirements for Approval of Explosives
            
              § 15.20
              Technical requirements.
              (a) Chemical composition. The chemical composition of the explosive shall be within the tolerances furnished by the applicant.
              (b) Rate-of-detonation test. The explosive shall propagate completely in the rate-of-detonation tesst. The test is conducted at an ambient temperature between 68 and 86 °F. Nongelatinous explosives are initiated with a test detonator only, while gelatinous explosives are initiated with a test detonator and a 60-gram tetryl pellet booster. The test is conducted on—
              (1) A 50-inch column of 11/4 inch diameter cartridges; and
              (2) A 50-inch column of the smallest diameter cartridges less than 11/4 inches submitted for testing.
              (c) Air-gap sensitivity. The air-gap sensitivity of the explosive shall be at least 2 inches at the minimum product firing temperature and 3 inches at a temperature between 68 and 86 °F, and the explosive shall propagate completely.
              (1) Air-gap sensitivity of the explosive is determined in the explosion-by-influence test using the 7-inch cartridge method. The air-gap sensitivity is determined for 11/4 inch diameter cartridges and each cartridge diameter smaller than 11/4 inches. Explosives are initiated with a test detonator.

              (2) The 7-inch cartridge method is conducted with two 8-inch cartridges. One inch is cut off the end of each cartridge. The cartridges are placed in a paper tube, the cut ends facing each other, with the appropriate 2-inch or 3-inch air gap between them. The test is conducted at a temperature between 68 and 86 °F and at the minimum product firing temperature proposed by the applicant, or 41 °F, whichever is lower. The test temperature at which the explosive propagates completely will be specified in the approval as the minimum product firing temperature at which the explosive is approved for use.
              (d) Gallery Test 7. The explosive shall yield a value of at least 450 grams for the lower 95 percent confidence limit (L95) on the weight for 50 percent probability of ignition (W50) in gallery test 7 and shall propagate completely. The L95 and W50 values for the explosive are determined by using the Bruceton up-and-down method. A minimum of 20 trials are made with explosive charges of varying weights, including wrapper and seals. Each charge is primed with a test detonator, then tamped and stemmed with one pound of dry-milled fire clay into the borehole of a steel cannon. The cannon is fired into air containing 7.7 to 8.3 percent of natural gas. The air temperature is between 68 and 86 °F.
              (e) Gallery Test 8. The explosive shall yield a value of at least 350 grams for the weight for 50 percent probability of ignition (WCDG) in gallery test 8 and shall propagate completely. The (WCDG) value for the explosive is determined using the Bruceton up-and-down method. A minimum of 10 tests are made with explosive charges of varying weights, including wrapper and seals. Each charge is primed with a test detonator, then tamped into the borehole of a steel cannon. The cannon is fired into a mixture of 8 pounds of bituminous coal dust predispersed into 640 cubic feet of air containing 3.8 to 4.2 percent of natural gas. The air temperature is between 68 and 86 °F.
              (f) Pendulum-friction test. The explosive shall show no perceptible reaction in the pendulum-friction test with the hard fiber-faced shoe. Ten trials of the test are conducted by releasing the steel shoe from a height of 59 inches. If there is evidence of sensitivity, the test is repeated with the hard fiber-faced shoe.
              (g) Toxic gases. The total volume equivalent to carbon monoxide (CO) of toxic gases produced by detonation of the explosive shall not exceed 2.5 cubic feet per pound of explosive as determined in the large chamber test. The explosive shall propagate completely.
              (1) The large chamber test is conducted with a one-pound explosive charge, including wrapper and seal, primed with a test detonator. The explosive charge is loaded into the borehole of a steel cannon, then tamped and stemmed with one pound of dry-milled fire clay. The cannon is fired into the large chamber and the gaseous products resulting from detonation of the explosive are collected and analyzed for toxic gases. At least two trials are conducted.
              (2) The equivalent volume of each toxic gas produced, relative to CO, is determined by multiplying the measured volume of the gas by a conversion factor. The conversion factor is equal to the threshold limit value, time weighted average (TLV-TWA) in parts-per-million for CO divided by the TLV-TWA for the toxic gas. The TLV-TWA conversion factor for each gas for which MSHA shall test is specified in Table I of this subpart. The total volume equivalent to CO of the toxic gases produced by detonation of the explosive is the sum of the equivalent volumes of the individual toxic gases.

              (A) Enclosures shall be made of metal and not have a compartment exceeding ten (10) feet in length. Glass or polycarbonate materials shall be the only materials utilized in the construction of windows and lenses. External surfaces of enclosures shall not exceed 150 °C (302 °F) and internal surface temperatures of enclosures with polycarbonate windows and lenses shall not exceed 115 °C (240 °F), in normal operation. Other non-metallic materials for enclosures or parts of enclosures will be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, under the new technology provisions in § 18.20(b) of this part.
              (B) Enclosures shall be rugged in construction and should meet existing requirements for minimum bolt size and spacing and for minimum wall, cover, and flange thicknesses specified in paragraph (g)(19) of § 7.304 Technical requirements. Enclosure fasteners should be uniform in size and length, be provided at all corners, and be secured from loosening by lockwashers or equivalent. An engineering analysis shall be provided for enclosure designs that deviate from the existing requirements. The analysis shall show that the proposed enclosure design meets or exceeds the mechanical strength of a comparable enclosure designed to 150 psig according to existing requirements, and that flamepath clearances in excess of existing requirements will not be produced at an internal pressure of 150 psig. This shall be verified by explosion testing the enclosure at a minimum of 150 psig.
              (C) Enclosures shall be designed to withstand a minimum pressure of at least 150 psig without leakage through any welds or castings, rupture of any part that affects explosion-proof integrity, clearances exceeding those permitted under existing requirements along flame-arresting paths, or permanent distortion exceeding 0.040-inch per linear foot.
              (D) Flamepath clearances, including clearances between fasteners and the holes through which they pass, shall not exceed those specified in existing requirements. No intentional gaps in flamepaths are permitted.

              (E) The minimum lengths of the flame arresting paths, based on enclosure volume, shall conform to those specified in existing requirements to the nearest metric equivalent value (e.g., 12.5 mm, 19 mm, and 25 mm are considered equivalent to 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch and 1 inch respectively for plane and cylindrical joints). The widths of any grooves for o-rings shall be deducted in measuring the widths of flame-arresting paths.
              (F) Gaskets shall not be used to form any part of a flame-arresting path. If o-rings are installed within a flamepath, the location of the o-rings shall meet existing requirements.
              (G) Cable entries into enclosures shall be of a type that utilizes either flame-resistant rope packing material or sealing rings (grommets). If plugs and mating receptacles are mounted to an enclosure wall, they shall be of explosion-proof construction. Insulated bushings or studs shall not be installed in the outside walls of enclosures. Lead entrances utilizing sealing compounds and flexible or rigid metallic conduit are not permitted.
              (H) Unused lead entrances shall be closed with a metal plug that is secured by spot welding, brazing, or equivalent.

              (I) Special explosion tests are required for explosion-proof enclosures that share leads (electric conductors) through a common wall with another explosion-proof enclosure. These tests are required to determine the presence of pressure piling conditions in either enclosure when one or more of the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts are sequentially removed from the common wall between the enclosures. Enclosures that exhibit pressures during these tests that exceed those specified in existing requirements must be provided with a warning tag. The durable warning tag must indicate that the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts be maintained in order to insure the explosion-proof integrity for either enclosure sharing a common wall. A warning tag is not required if the enclosures withstand a static pressure of twice the maximum value observed in the explosion tests.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (4) The application, all related documents, and all correspondence concerning it shall be addressed to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059.

              Nonmetallic rotating parts, such as belts and fans, shall be provided with a means to prevent an accumulation of static electricity.
            
            
              § 18.27
              Gaskets.
              A gasket(s) shall not be used between any two surfaces forming a flame-arresting path except as follows:
              (a) A gasket of lead, elastomer, or equivalent will be acceptable provided the gasket does not interfere with an acceptable metal-to-metal joint.
              (b) A lead gasket(s) or equivalent will be acceptable between glass and a hard metal to form all or a part of a flame-arresting path.
            
            
              § 18.28
              Devices for pressure relief, ventilation, or drainage.

              (a) Devices for installation on explosion-proof enclosures to relieve pressure, ventilate, or drain will be acceptable provided the length of the flame-arresting path and the clearances or size of holes in perforated metal will prevent discharge of flame in explosion tests.
              
              (b) Devices for pressure relief, ventilation, or drainage shall be constructed of materials that resist corrosion and distortion, and be so designed that they can be cleaned readily. Provision shall be made for secure attachment of such devices.
              (c) Devices for pressure relief, ventilation, or drainage will be acceptable for application only on enclosures with which they are explosion tested.
            
            
              § 18.29
              Access openings and covers, including unused lead-entrance holes.
              (a) Access openings in explosion-proof enclosures will be permitted only where necessary for maintenance of internal parts such as motor brushes and fuses.
              (b) Covers for access openings shall meet the same requirements as any other part of an enclosure except that threaded covers shall be secured against loosening, preferably with screws having heads requiring a special tool. (See Figure 1 in Appendix II.)
              (c) Holes in enclosures that are provided for lead entrances but which are not in use shall be closed with metal plugs secured by spot welding, brazing, or equivalent. (See Figure 10 in Appendix II.)

              Windows and lenses.
              (a) MSHA may waive testing of materials for windows or lenses except headlight lenses. When tested, material for windows or lenses shall meet the test requirements prescribed in § 18.66 and shall be sealed in place or provided with flange joints in accordance with § 18.31.
              (b) Windows or lenses shall be protected from mechanical damage by structural design, location, or guarding. Windows or lenses, other than headlight lenses, having an exposed area greater than 8 square inches, shall be provided with guarding or equivalent.
            
            
              § 18.31
              Enclosures—joints and fastenings.
              (a) Explosion-proof enclosures:
              (1) Cast or welded enclosures shall be designed to withstand a minimum internal pressure of 150 pounds per square inch (gage). Castings shall be free from blowholes.
              (2) Welded joints forming an enclosure shall have continuous gas-tight welds. All welds shall be made in accordance with American Welding Society standards.
              (3) External rotating parts shall not be constructed of aluminum alloys containing more than 0.6 percent magnesium.
              (4) MSHA reserves the right to require the applicant to conduct static-pressure tests on each enclosure when MSHA determines that the particular design will not permit complete visual inspection or when the joint(s) forming an enclosure is welded on one side only (see § 18.67).
              (5) Threaded covers and mating parts shall be designed with Class 1A and 1B (coarse, loose-fitting) threads. The flame-arresting path of threaded joints shall conform to the requirements of paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
              (6) Enclosure requirements shall be based on the internal volumes of the empty enclosure. The internal volume is the volume remaining after deducting the volume of any part that is essential in maintaining the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure or necessary for the operation. Essential parts include the parts that constitute the flame-arresting path and those necessary to secure parts that constitute a flame-arresting path. Enclosures shall meet the following requirements:

                  4 The widths of any grooves, such as grooves for holding oil seals or O-rings, shall be deducted in measuring the widths of flame-arresting paths.
                
                  5 If only two planes are involved, neither portion of a joint shall be less than 1/8 inch wide, unless the wider portion conforms to the same requirements as those for a joint that is all in one plane. If more than two planes are involved (as in labyrinths or tongue-and-groove joints) the combined lengths of those portions having prescribed clearances are considered.
                
                  6 The allowable diametrical clearance is 0.008 inch when the portion perpendicular to the plane portion is 1/4 inch or greater in length. If the perpendicular portion is more than 1/8 inch but less than 1/4 inch wide, the diametrical clearance shall not exceed 0.006 inch.
                
                  7 Where the term “bolt” is used, it refers to a machine bolt or a cap screw, and for either of these studs may be substituted provided the studs, bottom in blind holes, are completely welded in place, or the bottom of the hole is closed with a plug secured by weld or braze. Bolts shall be provided at all corners.
                
                  8 The requirements as to diametrical clearance around the bolt and minimum distance from the bolt hole to the inside of the explosion-proof enclosure apply to steel dowel pins. In addition, when such pins are used, the spacing between centers of the bolts on either side of the pin shall not exceed 5 inches.
                
                  9 Adequacy of bolt spacing will be judged on the basis of size and configuration of the enclosure, strength of materials, and explosion test results.
                
                  10 In general, minimum thread engagement shall be equal to or greater than the diameter of the bolt specified.
                
                  11 Threaded holes for fastening bolts shall be machined to remove burrs or projections that affect planarity of a surface forming a flame-arresting path.
                
                  12 This maximum clearance applies only when the bolt is located within the flamepath.
                
                  13 The edge of the bolt hole shall include the edge of any machining done to the bolt hole, such as chamfering.
                
                  14 Less than 7/16″ (1/4″ minimum) will be acceptable provided the diametrical clearance for fastening bolts does not exceed 1/32″.
                
                  15 Shafts or operating rods through journal bearings shall be at least 1/4″ in diameter. The length of fit shall not be reduced when a push button is depressed. Operating rods shall have a shoulder or head on the portion inside the enclosure. Essential parts riveted or bolted to the inside portion are acceptable in lieu of a head or shoulder, but cotter pins and similar devices shall not be used.
                
                  16 6″ with a minimum of 4 bolts.
              
              (7) O-rings, if used in a flame-arresting path, shall meet the following:
              (i) When the flame-arresting path is in one plane, the o-ring shall be located at least one-half the acceptable flame-arresting path length specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section within the outside edge of the path (see figure J-2 in the appendix to subpart J of part 7 of this chapter).
              (ii) When the flame-arresting path is one of the plane-cylindrical type (step joint), the o-ring shall be located at least 1/2 inch within the outer edge of the plane portion (see figure J-3 in the appendix to subpart J of part 7 of this chapter), or at the junction of the plane and cylindrical portion of the joint (see figure J-4 in the appendix to subpart J of part 7 of this chapter); or in the cylindrical portion (see figure J-5 in the appendix to subpart J of part 7 of this chapter).

              (8) Mating parts comprising a pressed fit shall result in a minimum interference of 0.001 inch between the parts. The minimum length of the pressed fit shall be equal to the minimum thickness requirement of paragraph (a)(6) of this section for the material in which the fit is made.
              (b) Enclosures for potted components: Enclosures shall be rugged and constructed with materials having 75 percent, or greater, of the thickness and flange width specified in paragraph (a) of this section. These enclosures shall be provided with means for attaching hose conduit, unless energy carried by the cable is intrinsically safe.
              (c) No assembly will be approved that requires the opening of an explosion-proof enclosure to operate a switch, rheostat, or other device during normal operation of a machine.

              Fastenings—additional requirements.
              (a) Bolts, screws, or studs shall be used for fastening adjoining parts to prevent the escape of flame from an enclosure. Hinge pins or clamps will be acceptable for this purpose provided MSHA determines them to be equally effective.
              (b) Lockwashers shall be provided for all bolts, screws, and studs that secure parts of explosion-proof enclosures. Special fastenings designed to prevent loosening will be acceptable in lieu of lockwashers, provided MSHA determines them to be equally effective.
              (c) Fastenings shall be as uniform in size as practicable to preclude improper assembly.
              (d) Holes for fastenings shall not penetrate to the interior of an explosion-proof enclosure, except as provided in paragraph (a)(9) of § 18.34, and shall be threaded to insure that a specified bolt or screw will not bottom even if its lockwasher is omitted.
              (e) A minimum of 1/8-inch of stock shall be left at the center of the bottom of each hole drilled for fastenings.
              (f) Fastenings used for joints on explosion-proof enclosures shall not be used for attaching nonessential parts or for making electrical connections.
              (g) The acceptable sizes for and spacings of fastenings shall be determined by the size of the enclosure, as indicated in § 18.31.
              (h) MSHA reserves the right to conduct explosion tests with standard bolts, nuts, cap screws, or studs substituted for any special high-tensile strength fastening(s) specified by the applicant.
              (i) Coil-thread inserts, if used in holes for fastenings, shall meet the following:
              (1) The inserts shall have internal screw threads.
              (2) The holes for the inserts shall be drilled and tapped consistent with the insert manufacturer's specifications.
              (3) The inserts shall be installed consistent with the insert manufacturer's specifications.
              (4) The insert shall be of sufficient length to ensure the minimum thread engagement of fastening specified in § 18.31(a)(6) of this part.

              § 18.34
              Motors.
              Explosion-proof electric motor assemblies intended for use in approved equipment in underground mines that are specifically addressed in part 7 of this chapter shall be approved under part 7 of this chapter after February 22, 1996. Those motor assemblies not specifically addressed under part 7 of this chapter shall be accepted or certified under this part.
              (a) General. (1) Motors shall have explosion-proof enclosures.

              (2) Motors submitted to MSHA for test shall be equipped with unshielded bearings regardless of whether that type of bearing is specified.
              
              (3) MSHA reserves the right to test motors with the maximum clearance specified between the shaft and the mating part which forms the required flame-arresting path. Also reserved is the right to remachine these parts, at the applicant's expense, to specified dimensions to provide the maximum clearance.
              
                Note:
                For example, a shaft with a diameter greater than 2 inches at the flame-arresting portion might require such machining.
              
              (4) Ball and roller bearings and oil seals will not be acceptable as flame-arresting paths; therefore, a separate path shall be provided between the shaft and another part, preferably inby the bearing. The length and clearances of such flame-arresting path shall conform to the requirements of § 18.31.
              (5) Labyrinths or other arrangements that provide change(s) in direction of escaping gases will be acceptable but the use of small detachable pieces shall not be permitted unless structurally unavoidable. The lengths of flame-arresting path(s) and clearance(s) shall conform to the requirements of § 18.31.
              (6) Oil seals shall be removed from motors prior to submission for explosion tests.
              
                Note:
                Oil seals will be removed from motors prior to explosion tests and therefore may be omitted from motors submitted for investigation.
              
              (7) Openings for filling and draining bearing lubricants shall be so located as to prevent escape of flame through them.
              (8) An outer bearing cap will not be considered as forming any part of a flame-arresting path unless the cap is used as a bearing cartridge.
              
                Note:
                The outer bearing cap will be omitted during explosion tests unless it houses the bearing.
              
              (9) If unavoidable, holes may be made through motor casings for bolts, studs, or screws to hold essential parts such as pole pieces, brush rigging, and bearing cartridges. Such parts shall be attached to the casing by at least two fastenings. The threaded holes in these parts shall be blind, unless the fastenings are inserted from the inside, in which case the fastenings shall not be accessible with the armature of the motor in place.
              (b) Direct-current motors. For direct-current motors with narrow interpoles, the distance from the edge of the pole piece to any bolt hole in the frame shall be not less than 1/8 inch. If the distance is 1/8 to 1/4 inch, the diametrical clearance for the pole bolt shall not exceed 1/64 inch for not less than 1/2 inch through the frame. Furthermore, the pole piece shall have the same radius as the inner surface of the frame. Pole pieces may be shimmed as necessary.
              (c) Alternating-current motors. Stator laminations that form a part of an explosion-proof enclosure will be acceptable provided: (1) The laminations and their end rings are fastened together under pressure; (2) the joint between the end rings and the laminations is not less than 1/4 inch, but preferably as close to 1 inch as possible; and (3) it shall be impossible to insert a 0.0015-inch thickness gage to a depth exceeding 1/8 inch between adjacent laminations or between end rings and laminations.
              (d) Small motors (alternating- and direct-current). Motors having internal free volume not exceeding 350 cubic inches and joints not exceeding 32 inches in outer circumference will be acceptable for investigation if provided with rabbet joints between the stator frame and the end bracket having the following dimensions:

              (a) Each machine shall be equipped with a circuit-interrupting device by means of which all power conductors can be deenergized at the machine. A manually operated controller will not be acceptable as a service switch.
              (b) When impracticable to mount the main-circuit-interrupting device on a machine, a remote enclosure will be acceptable. When contacts are used as a main-circuit-interrupting device, a means for opening the circuit shall be provided at the machine and at the remote contactors.

              (d) Each handheld tool shall be provided with a two-pole switch of the “dead-man-control” type that must be held closed by hand and will open when hand pressure is released.
              (e) A machine designed to operate from both trolley wire and portable cable shall be provided with a transfer switch, or equivalent, which prevents energizing one from the other. Such a switch shall be designed to prevent electrical connection to the machine frame when the cable is energized.
              (f) Belt conveyors shall be equipped with control switches to automatically stop the driving motor in the event the belt is stopped, or abnormally slowed down.

              Connection boxes used to facilitate replacement of cables or machine components shall be explosion-proof. Portable-cable terminals on cable reels need not be in explosion-proof enclosures provided that connections are well made, adequately insulated, protected from damage by location, and securely clamped to prevent mechanical strain on the connections.
            
            
              § 18.50
              Protection against external arcs and sparks.
              Provision shall be made for maintaining the frames of all off-track machines and the enclosures of related detached components at safe voltages by using one or a combination of the following:

              (a) A separate conductor(s) in the portable cable in addition to the power conductors by which the machine frame can be connected to an acceptable grounding medium, and a separate conductor in all cables connecting related components not on a common chassis. The cross-sectional area of the additional conductor(s) shall not be less than 50 percent of that of one power conductor unless a ground-fault tripping relay is used, in which case the minimum size may be No. 8 (AWG). Cables smaller than No. 6 (AWG) shall have an additional conductor(s) of the same size as one power conductor.
              (b) A means of actuating a circuit-interrupting device, preferably at the outby end of the portable cable.
              
                Note:
                The frame to ground potential shall not exceed 40 volts.
              
              (c) A device(s) such as a diode(s) of adequate peak inverse voltage rating and current-carrying capacity to conduct possible fault current through the grounded power conductor. Diode installations shall include: (1) An overcurrent device in series with the diode, the contacts of which are in the machine's control circuit; and (2) a blocking diode in the control circuit to prevent operation of the machine with the polarity reversed.
            
            
              § 18.51

The setting of each device shall be specified. For headlight and control circuits, each conductor shall be protected by a fuse or equivalent. Any circuit that is entirely contained in an explosion-proof enclosure shall be exempt from these requirements.
              (b) Each motor shall be protected by an automatic overcurrent device. One protective device will be acceptable when two motors of the same rating operate simultaneously and perform virtually the same duty.
              (1) If the overcurrent-protective device in a direct-current circuit does not open both lines, particular attention shall be given to marking the polarity at the terminals or otherwise preventing the possibility of reversing connections which would result in changing the circuit interrupter to the grounded line.
              (2) Three-phase alternating-current motors shall have an overcurrent-protective device in at least two phases such that actuation of a device in one phase will cause the opening of all three phases.
              (c) Circuit-interrupting devices shall be so designed that they can be reset without opening the compartment in which they are enclosed.
              (d) All magnetic circuit-interrupting devices shall be mounted in a manner to preclude the possibility of their closing by gravity.

If a steel shield is mounted in conjunction with an aluminum wall or cover, the thickness of the steel shield is used to determine the minimum free distances.
              (p) The following static pressure test must be performed on each prototype design of explosion-proof enclosures containing high-voltage switchgear prior to the explosion tests. The static pressure test must also be performed on every explosion-proof enclosure containing high-voltage switchgear, at the time of manufacture, unless the manufacturer uses an MSHA accepted quality assurance procedure covering inspection of the enclosure. Procedures must include a detailed check of parts against the drawings to determine that the parts and the drawings coincide and that the minimum requirements stated in part 18 have been followed with respect to materials, dimensions, configuration and workmanship.
              (1) Test procedure. (i) The enclosure must be internally pressurized to at least the design pressure, maintaining the pressure for a minimum of 10 seconds.
              (ii) Following the pressure hold, the pressure must be removed and the pressurizing agent removed from the enclosure.
              (2) Acceptable performance. (i) The enclosure during pressurization must not exhibit—
              (A) Leakage through welds or casting; or
              (B) Rupture of any part that affects the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure.

              (B) Following removal of the pressurizing agents, the enclosure must not exhibit:
              (1) Cracks in welds visible to the naked eye;
              (2) Permanent deformation exceeding 0.040 inches per linear foot; or
              (3) Excessive clearances along flame-arresting paths following retightening of fastenings, as necessary.
              (2) Enclosures for production. Every explosion-proof enclosure containing high-voltage switchgear manufactured after the prototype was tested must undergo one of the following tests or procedures:
              (i) The static pressure test specified in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section; or
              (ii) An MSHA-accepted quality assurance procedure covering inspection of the enclosure.
              (A) The quality assurance procedure must include a detailed check of parts against the drawings to determine that—

              § 18.62
              Tests to determine explosion-proof characteristics.
              (a) In testing for explosion-proof characteristics of an enclosure, it shall be filled and surrounded with various explosive mixtures of natural gas and air. The explosive mixture within the enclosure will be ignited electrically and the explosion pressure developed therefrom recorded. The point of ignition within the enclosure will be varied. Motor armatures and/or rotors will be stationary in some tests and revolving in others. Coal dust having a minimum of 22 percent dry volatile matter and a minimum heat constant of 11,000 moist BTU (coal containing natural bed moisture but not visible surface water) ground to a fineness of minus 200 mesh U.S. Standard sieve series. At MSHA's discretion dummies may be substituted for internal electrical components during some of the tests. Not less than 16 explosion tests shall be conducted; however, the nature of the enclosure and the results obtained during the tests will determine whether additional tests shall be made.
              (b) Explosion tests of an enclosure shall not result in:
              (1) Discharge of flame.
              (2) Ignition of an explosive mixture surrounding the enclosure.
              (3) Development of afterburning.
              (4) Rupture of any part of the enclosure or any panel or divider within the enclosure.

              (5) Permanent distortion of the enclosure exceeding 0.040 inch per linear foot.
              
              (c) When a pressure exceeding 125 pounds per square inch (gage) is developed during explosion tests, MSHA reserves the right to reject an enclosure(s) unless (1) constructional changes are made that result in a reduction of pressure to 125 pounds per square inch (gage) or less, or (2) the enclosure withstands a dynamic pressure of twice the highest value recorded in the initial test.

              Static-pressure tests.
              Static-pressure tests shall be conducted by the applicant on each enclosure of a specific design when MSHA determines that visual inspection will not reveal defects in castings or in single-seam welds. Such test procedure shall be submitted to MSHA for approval and the specifications on file with MSHA shall include a statement assuring that such tests will be conducted. The static pressure to be applied shall be 150 pounds per square inch (gage) or one and one-half times the maximum pressure recorded in MSHA's explosion tests, whichever is greater.
            
            
              § 18.68
              Tests for intrinsic safety.
              (a) General:
              (1) Tests for intrinsic safety will be conducted under the general concepts of “intrinsically safe” as defined in Subpart A of this part. Further tests or requirements may be added at any time if features of construction or use or both indicate them to be necessary. Some tests included in these requirements may be omitted on the basis of previous experience.
              (2) Intrinsically safe circuits and/or components will be subjected to tests consisting of making and breaking the intrinsically safe circuit under conditions judged to simulate the most hazardous probable faults or malfunctions. Tests will be made in the most easily ignitable mixture of methane or natural gas and air. The method of making and breaking the circuit may be varied to meet a particular condition.
              (3) Those components which affect intrinsic safety must meet the following requirements:
              (i) Current limiting components shall consist of two equivalent devices each of which singly will provide intrinsic safety. They shall not be operated at more than 50 percent of their ratings.
              (ii) Components of reliable construction shall be used and they shall be so mounted as to provide protection against shock and vibration in normal use.
              (iii) Semiconductors shall be amply sized. Rectifiers and transistors shall be operated at not more than two-thirds of their rated current and permissible peak inverse voltage. Zener diodes shall be operated at not more than one-half of their rated current and shall short under abnormal conditions.
              (iv) Electrolytic capacitors shall be operated at not more than two-thirds of their rated voltage. They shall be designed to withstand a test voltage of 1,500 volts.
              (4) Intrinsically safe circuits shall be so designed that after failure of a single component, and subsequent failures resulting from this first failure, the circuit will remain intrinsically safe.
              (5) The circuit will be considered as intrinsically safe if in the course of testing no ignitions occur.
              (b) Complete intrinsically safe equipment powered by low energy batteries:
              (1) Short-circuit tests shall be conducted on batteries at normal operating temperature. Tests may be made on batteries at elevated temperature if such tests are deemed necessary.
              (2) Resistance devices for limiting short-circuit current shall be an integral part of the battery, or installed as close to the battery terminal as practicable.
              (3) Transistors of battery-operated equipment may be subjected to thermal “run-away” tests to determine that they will not ignite an explosive atmosphere.

              (4) A minimum of 1,000 make-break sparks will be produced in each test for direct current circuits with consideration given to reversed polarity.
              (5) Tests on batteries shall include series and/or parallel combinations of twice the normal battery complement, and the effect of capacitance and inductance, added to that normally present in the circuit.
              (6) No ignition shall occur when approximately 1/2-inch of a single wire strand representative of the wire used in the equipment or device is shorted across the intrinsically safe circuit.
              (7) Consideration shall be given to insure against accidental reversal of polarity.
              (c) Line-powered equipment and devices:
              (1) Line-powered equipment shall meet all applicable provisions specified for battery-powered equipment.
              (2) Nonintrinsically safe components supplying power for intrinsically safe circuits shall be housed in explosion-proof enclosures and be provided with energy limiting components in the enclosure.
              (3) Wiring for nonintrinsically safe circuits shall not be intermingled with wiring for intrinsically safe circuits.
              (4) Transformers that supply power for intrinsically safe circuits shall have the primary and secondary windings physically separated. They shall be designed to withstand a test voltage of 1,500 volts when rated 125 volts or less and 2,500 volts when rated more than 125 volts.
              (5) The line voltage shall be increased to 120 percent of nominal rated voltage to cover power line voltage variations.
              (6) In investigations of alternating current circuits a minimum of 5,000 make-break sparks will be produced in each test.
              (d) The design of intrinsically safe circuits shall preclude extraneous voltages caused by insufficient isolation or inductive coupling. The investigation shall determine the effect of ground faults where applicable.
              (e) Identification markings: Circuits and components of intrinsically safe equipment and devices shall be adequately identified by marking or labeling. Battery-powered equipment shall be marked to indicate the manufacturer, type designation, ratings, and size of batteries used.
            
            
              § 18.69
              Adequacy tests.

              (c) Upon receipt of the application for modification, and after such examination and investigation as may be deemed necessary by MSHA, MSHA will notify the owner and the District office of the mine workers' organization having jurisdiction at the mine where such equipment is to be operated stating the modifications which are proposed to be made and MSHA's action thereon.
              [33 FR 4660, Mar. 19, 1968, as amended at 43 FR 12314, Mar. 24, 1978; 60 FR 35693, July 11, 1995; 73 FR 52211, Sept. 9, 2008]
            
            
              § 18.82
              Permit to use experimental electric face equipment in a gassy mine or tunnel.
              (a) Application for permit. An application for a permit to use experimental electric face equipment in a gassy mine or tunnel will be considered only when submitted by the user of the equipment. The user shall submit a written application to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, 201 12th Street South, Arlington, VA 22202-5452, and send a copy to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059.
              (b) Requirements—(1) Constructional. (i) Experimental equipment shall be so constructed that it will not constitute a fire or explosion hazard.
              (ii) Enclosures designed as explosion-proof, unless already certified, or components of previously approved (permissible) machines, shall be submitted to MSHA for inspection and test and shall meet the applicable design requirements of subpart B of this part. Components designed as intrinsically safe also shall be submitted to MSHA for investigation.
              (iii) MSHA may, at its discretion, waive the requirements for detailed drawings of component parts, inspections, and tests provided satisfactory evidence is submitted that an enclosure has been certified, or otherwise accepted by a reputable testing agency whose standards are substantially equivalent to those set forth in subpart B of this part.
              (2) Specifications. The specifications for experimental equipment shall include a layout drawing (see Figure 1 in Appendix II) or photograph(s) with the components, including overcurrent-protective device(s) with setting(s) identified thereon or separately; a wiring diagram; and descriptive material necessary to insure safe operation of the equipment. Drawings already filed with MSHA need not be duplicated by the applicant, but shall be properly identified.
              (c) Final inspection. Unless equipment is delivered to MSHA for investigation, the applicant shall notify the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, when and where the experimental equipment will be ready for inspection by a representative of MSHA before installing it on a trial basis. Such inspection shall be completed before a permit will be issued.
              (d) Issuance of permit. When the inspection discloses full compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart, the Assistant Secretary will issue a permit sanctioning the operation of a single unit in a gassy mine or tunnel, as designated in the application. If the applicant is not the assembler of the equipment, a copy of the permit also may be sent to the assembler.
              (e) Duration of permit. A permit will be effective for a period of 6 months. For a valid reason, to be stated in a written application, the Administrator of MSHA may grant an extension of a permit for an additional period, not exceeding 6 months. Further extension will be granted only where, after investigation, the Assistant Secretary finds that for reasons beyond the control of the user, it has not been possible to complete the experiment within the period covered by the extended permit.
              (f) Permit label. With the notification granting a permit, the applicant will receive a photographic copy of a permit label bearing the following:
              (1) Emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration.
              (2) Permit number.

            § 19.1
            Purpose.
            (a) The purpose of investigations made under this part is to promote the development of electric cap lamps that may be used in mines, especially in mines that may contain dangerous concentrations of methane. Lists of such lamps will be published from time to time in order that State mine-inspection departments, compensation bureaus, mine operators, miners, and others interested in safe equipment for mines may have information in regard to available permissible electric cap lamps. This part supersedes Schedule 6C issued under date of December 21, 1935, and goes into effect August 26, 1939.
            (b) Any electric cap lamp that meets the requirements set forth in this part will be termed “permissible” by MSHA and, if actively marketed, will be listed as such in publications relating to permissible electric cap lamps. MSHA will test only electrical equipment that in the opinion of its qualified representatives is constructed of suitable materials, is of good quality workmanship, is based on sound engineering principles, and is safe for its intended use. MSHA reserves the right to modify design, construction, and test requirements to obtain the same degree of protection as provided by the tests described in this part.
            (c) Definition of permissible. Completely assembled and conforming in every respect with the design formally approved by the MSHA under this part. (Approvals under this part are given only to equipment for use in gassy and dusty mines.)

            § 19.5
            General requirements for approval.

            Electric cap lamps shall be complete units. They shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for the conditions of underground service. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard if used in gassy or dusty mine atmospheres or bodily hazard from the spilling of the battery electrolyte. They shall exhibit, under laboratory test conditions, the various minimum performance requirements specified in this part.
          
          
            § 19.6
            Specific requirements for approval.
            (a) Design. In the determination of the adequacy of the lamp, with respect to design, the following points will be considered: (1) The materials used; (2) construction; (3) weight; (4) amount of light; (5) distribution of light; and (6) exclusion of dust from the headpiece. The suitability of the materials and the construction shall be determined by preliminary inspection, by dropping tests, 1
               by durability tests of the cord and cord armor, 2
               and by the general behavior of the lamp equipment during the investigation. The amount and distribution of the light shall be judged both by observation of the illumination on a white screen and by photometric measurements.
            
              
                1 Batteries are dropped 3 feet, at least 20 times onto an oak floor. Headpieces are dropped 6 feet, at least 20 times, onto concrete.
            
            
              
                2 Ten cords, assembled with the cord armor and outlet of the lamp with which it is to be used, are slatted at least 100,000 times through an arc of 50 degrees at approximately 90 slattings per minute.
            
            (b) Angle of light beam. MSHA recommends that the angle of the light beam be at least 130 degrees horizontally to insure that the contrast edge of the beam is away from the more sensitive sector of the wearer's vision; however, to allow for manufacturing and assembly tolerances and the use of multiple filament bulbs, MSHA will approve lamps giving a minimum beam angle of 120 degrees. If the bulb has more than one major filament, the one giving the smaller angle will be used in the determination.
            (c) Light distribution, visual. Excepting special headpieces for inspection purposes, the area illuminated by the beam shall be free from sharp gradations in light intensity and spectral shadows.
            (d) Light distribution, photometric. (1) Excepting special headpieces for inspection purposes, the maximum candlepower of the light beam shall not be greater than 25 times the average or mean candlepower of the beam. 3
              
            
            
              
                3 The minimum allowable angle of 120 degrees will be used in determining the mean candlepower of the beam.
            
            (2) The minimum candlepower of the beam based upon readings at the design voltage of the bulb shall not be less than 1.
          
          
            § 19.7
            Protection against explosion hazard.
            Unless properly designed, electric cap lamps may present two sources of probable explosion hazards: Ignition of an explosive atmosphere by the heated filament of the bulb in case the bulb glass is accidentally broken, and ignition by sparks or flashes from the battery. MSHA therefore requires the following safeguards:
            (a) Safety device or design. The headpiece shall have a safety device to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air if the bulb glass surrounding the filament is broken. Alternatively, if the lamp is designed and constructed to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by protecting the bulb from breakage and preventing exposure of the hot filament, no safety device is required.
            (b) Headpiece lock or seal. The headpiece shall be provided with a lock or seal to prevent unauthorized removal of the lens and tampering with the safety device, the bulb, or the electrical contacts.
            (c) Locks on charging terminals. Lamps shall be equipped with a magnetic or other equally effective lock at the battery, the headpiece, or the cord assembly to prevent unauthorized access to live charging terminals.
            (d) Protection of battery terminals. The battery covers of lamps that are recharged through the cord shall be so constructed and assembled as to prevent unauthorized access to the battery terminals.
            (e) Battery current restricted. The amount of current flow between the conductors of the cord, if short-circuited just outside of the battery casing or cord armor, shall be limited by the design of the battery or by a fuse to such a value 4
               as will not produce sparks that will ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.
            
              
                4 The following maximum short-circuit current values may be used as a guide in the design of cap lamp batteries: 100 amperes for a 4-volt battery; 75 amperes for a 6-volt battery; 50 amperes for an 8-volt battery.
            

            (f) It shall not be possible to obtain a difference of potential between any two accessible points of the cap lamp when assembled for use.

            § 19.8
            Protection against bodily hazard.
            This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the wearer by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA therefore requires that:
            (a) Spilling of electrolyte. The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that, when properly filled, the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under actual service conditions. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service.
            (b) Corrosion of battery container. The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of use.
          
          
            § 19.9
            Performance.
            In addition to the general design and the safety features, MSHA considers that a lamp of permissible type should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to performance, as follows:
            (a) Time of burning and candlepower. Permissible electric cap lamps shall burn for at least 10 consecutive hours on one charge of the battery and shall give during that period a mean candlepower of light beam of not less than 1.
            (b) Bulb life. The average life of the bulbs shall be not less than 200 hours, and at least 92 percent of the bulbs shall have a life of 150 hours. The life of a bulb is the number of hours its main filament will burn in the cap lamp or its equivalent.
            The life of a bulb having main filaments in parallel is considered ended when the first filament ceases to burn; the life of a bulb having independent main filament is considered ended when the last filament ceases to burn.
            (c) Bulb uniformity. (1) The bulbs submitted shall meet the following minimum requirements for variation in current consumption and candlepower:
            (2) The current consumption of at least 94 percent of the bulbs shall not exceed the average current by more than 6 percent. The candlepower (s. cp.) of at least 90 percent of the bulbs shall not fall short of the average candlepower by more than 30 percent.
            (d) Corrosion of contacts. Battery terminals and leads therefrom, as well as the battery gas vents, shall be designed to minimize corrosion of the electrical contacts.
            [Sched. 6D, 4 FR 4003, Sept. 21, 1939, as amended at 47 FR 11369, Mar. 16, 1982]
          
          
            § 19.10
            Material required for MSHA records.
            In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, detailed records are kept covering each investigation. These include drawings and actual equipment, as follows:
            (a) Drawings. The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings, which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted, to show the details of the lamp as approved. These drawings are used to identify the lamp in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
            (b) Actual equipment. (1) If MSHA so desires, parts of the lamps which are used in the tests will be retained as a permanent record of the investigation and of the lamps submitted.

            (2) If the lamp is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer, as soon as his first manufactured lamps are available, to submit one complete lamp, bearing the approval plate, as a record of his commercial product.
          
          
            § 19.11
            How approvals are granted.
            (a) All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A lamp will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers judge that the lamp has met the requirements of the part and MSHA's records concerning the lamp are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the lamp as it is to be commercially made. No verbal reports of MSHA's decisions, concerning the investigation will be given, and no informal approvals will be granted.
            (b) As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval he shall be free to advertise his lamps as permissible.
            [Sched. 6D, 4 FR 4003, Sept. 21, 1939, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2718, Apr. 23, 1955]
          
          
            § 19.12
            Wording, purpose, and use of approval plate.
            (a) Approval plate. The manufacturer shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on the battery container of each permissible lamp. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration and be inscribed as follows: “Permissible Electric Cap Lamp. Approval No. ____ issued to the ____ Company.” When deemed necessary, an appropriate caution statement shall be added. The size and position of the approval plate shall be satisfactory to MSHA.
            (b) Purpose of approval plate. The approval plate is a label which identifies the lamp so that anyone can tell at a glance whether or not the lamp is of the permissible type. By it, the manufacturer can point out that his lamp complies with specifications of MSHA and that it has been judged as suitable for use in gassy mines.
            (c) Use of approval plate. Permission to place MSHA's approval plate on his lamp obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of his product and to see that each lamp is constructed according to the drawings which have been accepted by MSHA for this lamp and which are in MSHA's files. Lamps exhibiting changes in design which have not been approved are not permissible lamps and must not bear MSHA's approval plate.
            (d) Withdrawal of approval. MSHA reserves the right to rescind, for cause, at any time any approval granted under this part.
            [Sched. 6D, 4 FR 4003, Sept. 21, 1939, as amended at 43 FR 12314, Mar. 24, 1978]
          
          
            § 19.13
            Instructions for handling future changes in lamp design.
            All approvals are granted with the understanding that the manufacturer will make his lamp according to the drawings which he has submitted to MSHA and which have been considered and included in the approval. Therefore, when he desires to make any change in the design of the lamp, he should first of all obtain MSHA's approval of the change. The procedure is as follows:
            (a)(1) The manufacturer shall write to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, requesting an extension of the original approval and stating the change or changes desired. With this letter the manufacturer should submit a revised drawing or drawings showing the changes in detail, and one of each of the changed lamp parts.
            (2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application:
            (i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
            (ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
            (iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and

            (iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.

            § 20.6
            General requirements.
            (a) The lamps shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for the service for which they are designed and approved.
            (b) The intensity of light, distribution of light, and battery capacity shall be adequate for the use for which the lamp is intended.
            (c) Battery terminals and leads therefrom, as well as the battery gas vents, shall be designed to minimize corrosion of the electrical contacts.
            (d) Bulbs and other replacement parts of the lamps shall be adequately marked as a means of identification.
          
          
            § 20.7
            Specific requirements.
            Two general classes of electric lamps are recognized in these requirements, namely: Class 1, those that are self-contained and easily carried by hand, and class 2, those that may or may not be self-contained and not so readily portable as the first class.
            (a) Class 1. Class 1 includes hand lamps, signal lamps, inspection lamps, flashlights, and animal lamps which are operated by small storage batteries or dry cells.
            (b) Class 2. Class 2 includes lamps such as the pneumatic-electric types and large battery lamps.
          
          
            § 20.8
            Class 1 lamps.
            (a) Protection against explosion hazards. Unless properly designed, class 1 lamps present two sources of probable explosion hazards: Ignition of an explosive atmosphere by the heated filament of the bulb in case the bulb glass is accidentally broken, and ignition by electric sparks or arcs from the battery or connections thereto. MSHA's therefore, requires the following safeguards:
            (1) Safety device or design. The lighting unit shall have a safety device to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air if the bulb glass surrounding the filament is broken. Alternatively, if the lamp is designed and constructed of materials that will prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by protecting the bulb from breakage and preventing exposure of the hot filament, no separate safety device is required. Alternative designs will be evaluated by mechanical impact tests, temperature tests and thermal shock tests to determine that the protection provided is no less effective than a safety device.
            (2) Safety device (protection). The design of the safety device and the housing which protects it shall be such that the action of the safety device is positive; yet the lamp shall not be too readily extinguished during normal service by the unnecessary operation of the device.
            (3) Locks or seals. For lamps other than flashlights, all parts, such as bulb housing and battery container, through which access may be had to live terminals or contacts shall be adequately sealed or equipped with magnetic or other equally reliable locks to prevent opening by unauthorized persons. For flashlights, provision shall be made for sealing the battery container.
            (4) Battery current restricted. Unless all current-carrying parts including conductors, are adequately covered and protected by the sealed or locked compartments, the maximum possible current flow through that part shall be limited by battery design, or by an enclosed-type fuse inside the sealed or locked container, to values that will not produce sparks or arcs sufficient to ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.
            (b) Protection against bodily hazard. This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the user by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA, therefore, requires that:
            (1) Spilling of electrolyte. The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that when properly filled the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under conditions of normal use. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service.
            (2) Corrosion of battery container. The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of normal use.
            [Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended at 5 FR 3467, Aug. 30, 1940; 54 FR 30513, July 20, 1989]
          
          
            § 20.9
            Class 2 lamps.
            (a) Safety. (1) Unless special features of the lamp prevent ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by the broken bulb or other igniting sources within the lamp, the bulb and all spark-producing parts must be enclosed in explosion-proof compartments.
            (2) Explosion-proof compartments will be tested while filled and surrounded with explosive mixtures of Pittsburgh natural gas 1
               and air. A sufficient number of tests of each compartment will be made to prove that there is no danger of ignition of the mixture surrounding the lamp by explosions within the compartment. The lamp will not pass the above tests, even though the surrounding explosive mixtures are not ignited, if external flame is observed, if excessive pressures are developed, or if excessive distortion of any part of the compartment takes place.
            
              
                1 Investigation has shown that for practical purposes Pittsburgh natural gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory substitute for pure methane.
            
            (3) Glass-enclosed parts of such compartments must be guarded and be of extra-heavy glass to withstand pick blows, and be adequately protected by shrouds or by an automatic cut-out that opens the lamp circuit if the enclosure is broken.
            (4) When an explosion-proof enclosure consists of two or more parts that are held together securely by bolts or some suitable means to permit assembly, the flanges comprising the joints between parts shall have surfaces with metal-to-metal contact, except enclosures requiring glass, in which case glass-to-metal joints are permitted. Gaskets, if adequate, may be used to obtain a firm seat for the glass but not elsewhere. Rubber, putty, and plaster of paris are not acceptable as material for gaskets. For enclosures having an unoccupied volume (air space) of more than 60 cubic inches the width of the joint measured along the shortest flame path from the inside to the outside of the enclosure shall not be less than 1 inch. When the unoccupied volume (air space) is less than 60 cubic inches, this path shall not be less than three-fourths inch.
            (b) Locks and seals (lighting attachment). Explosion-proof compartments shall be equipped with seals or locks that prevent unauthorized and unsafe opening of the compartments in a mine.
            (c) Locks or seals (battery). The battery shall be enclosed in a locked or sealed container that will prevent exposure of live terminals.
            (d) Temperature of lamp. The temperature of the lamp under conditions of use shall not be such that a person may be burned in handling it.
            (e) Cable and connection. (1) The cable or cord connecting the lamp to its battery shall be of high-grade design and materials, comparable to the specially recommended trailing cables as listed by MSHA, and shall be not more than 15 feet in length.
            (2) The cable (or cord) shall be adequately protected at the battery end by a fuse in the locked battery box or housing. The cable (or cord) and the fuse shall be considered parts of the lamp, and specifications for them shall be submitted by the lamp manufacturer.
            (3) The method of terminating the cable (or cord) at the lamp and at the battery housing shall be adequate, but in no case shall the cable or cord be detachable.
            MSHA reserves the right to make minor changes in the requirements outlined in paragraphs (e) (1), (2), and (3) of this section (No. 9, class 2 lamps), as experience and service prove to be necessary in the interests of safety.
          
          
            § 20.10
            Tests (class 1 and 2 lamps).
            Such tests will be made as are necessary to prove the adequacy of a lamp or any of its parts in fulfilling the purposes for which it was designed. These tests include the following:
            (a) Safety tests, including tests of safey devices, electrical contacts, and explosion-proof features.
            (b) Photometric tests.

            (c) Tests to demonstrate adequacy of mechanical strength.
            
            (d) Tests of nonspilling features (storage-battery lamps of class 1).
            (e) Temperature tests.
          
          
            § 20.11
            Material required for MSHA records.
            In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, detailed records are kept covering each investigation. These include drawings and actual equipment, as follows:
            (a) Drawings. The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before approval is granted, to show the details of the lamp as approved, are retained. These drawings are used to identify the lamp and its parts in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
            (b) Equipment. (1) If MSHA so desires, parts of the lamps which are used in the tests will be retained as a permanent record of the investigation and of the lamps submitted.
            (2) If the lamp is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer, as soon as his first manufactured lamps are available, to submit one complete lamp, with the approval plate attached, as a record of his commercial product.
          
          
            § 20.12
            How approvals are granted.
            (a) All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A lamp will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers judge that the lamp has met the requirements of this part and after MSHA's records concerning the lamp are complete, including manufacturer's drawings that show the lamp as it is to be made commercially. No verbal reports of MSHA's decision concerning the investigation will be given, and no informal approvals will be granted.
            (b) As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval he shall be free to advertise his lamp as permissible.
            [Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2719, Apr. 23, 1955]
          
          
            § 20.13
            Approval plate.
            The manufacturer shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on the battery container or housing of each permissible lamp. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and be inscribed as follows: “Permissible _____ Lamp. Approval No. __________ issued to the __________ Company.” When deemed necessary, an appropriate caution statement shall be added. The size, material, and position of the approval plate shall be satisfactory to MSHA.
            (a) Purpose of approval plate. The approval plate is a label which identifies the lamp so that anyone can tell at a glance whether the lamp is of the permissible type or not. By it the manufacturer can point out that his lamp complies with specifications of MSHA and that it has been adjudged safe for use in gassy and dusty mines.
            (b) Use of approval plate. Permission to place MSHA's approval plate on his lamp obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of his product and to see that each lamp is constructed according to the drawings which have been accepted by MSHA for this lamp and which are in the MSHA files. Lamps exhibiting changes in design which have not been approved are not permissible lamps and must not bear MSHA's approval plate.
            (c) Withdrawal of approval. MSHA reserves the right to rescind for cause at any time any approval granted under this part.
            [Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended at 5 FR 3467, Aug. 30, 1940; 43 FR 12314, Mar. 24, 1978]
          
          
            § 20.14
            Instructions for handling future changes in lamp design.
            All approvals are granted with the understanding that the manufacturer will make the lamp according to the drawings submitted to MSHA, which have been considered and included in the approval. Therefore, when the manufacturer desires to make any change in the design of the lamp, the manufacturer should first obtain an extension of the original approval to cover the change. The procedure is as follows:

            (a)(1) The manufacturer shall write to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, requesting an extension of the original approval and describing the change or changes proposed. With this letter the manufacturer should submit a revised drawing or drawings showing the changes in detail, and one of each of the changed lamp parts.
            (2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application:
            (i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
            (ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
            (iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and
            (iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.
            (b) MSHA will consider the application and inspect the drawings and parts to determine whether it will be necessary to make any tests.
            (c) If no tests are necessary, the applicant will be advised of the acceptance or rejection of the proposed change by letter from MSHA.
            (d) If tests are judged necessary, the applicant will be advised of the material that will be required.

            § 22.6
            General requirements.

            Methane detectors approved under this part shall be portable. They shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for service conditions underground. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard if used in gaseous mine atmospheres nor any bodily hazard, such as spilling of battery electrolyte. They shall exhibit under laboratory test conditions various requirements of minimum performance that are specified in this part.
          
          
            § 22.7
            Specific requirements.
            (a) Design. In the determination of adequacy of design, the following points will be considered: (1) Materials used, (2) construction, (3) accuracy, (4) size and shape, (5) range of detection (or indication), (6) life of the active parts, and (7) attention required. The suitability of the materials and the construction shall be determined by preliminary inspection, by dropping tests, by laboratory and field tests in gas and air mixtures, and by the general behavior of the equipment during the investigation.
            (b) Safety against explosion hazard—(1) Detectors. Detectors shall be constructed so that they will not cause external ignitions when used in gaseous mine atmospheres.
            (2) Seals or locks. All parts through which external ignitions might result shall be covered and protected adequately. All covers shall be sealed adequately or equipped with magnetic or other equally reliable locks to prevent their being opened by unauthorized persons.
            (3) Glasses. Glasses or glass windows shall be of good-quality glass and protected adequately against breakage. Unguarded windows may be considered adequate in this respect, provided they are of small diameter and are of reasonably thick glass.
            (4) Battery. If the detector is equipped with a battery, it shall be of such design that it will not produce sparks that will ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.
            (5) Detectors of the flame type. Methane detectors of the flame type shall be subject to the requirements of the flame-lamp schedule then in force.
            (c) Safety against bodily hazard. Bodily hazard with battery-type detectors is due chiefly to possible burning of the user by electrolyte that has spilled from the battery. MSHA, therefore, requires that:
            (1) Spilling of electrolyte. The battery shall be so designed and constructed that when properly filled it will not spill electrolyte under actual service conditions.
            (2) Corrosion of battery container. The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of use.
            (d) Performance. In addition to the general design and safety features, MSHA considers that permissible types of methane detectors should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to their performance, as follows:
            (1) Detectors. (i) When the detector is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions, it shall be possible to detect at least 1 percent methane in air, and increasing percentages up to 5 percent shall be shown by continuously increasing evidence.
            (ii) The average number of determinations that may be made in approximately 2-percent methane mixtures without recharging a battery or replacing a chemical accessory shall not be less than 25, and the average number of such determinations that may be made without replacing any other part shall be not less than 100.
            (2) Indicating detectors. Indicating detectors shall give indications of as low as 0.25 percent methane. Detectors having an upper scale limit of 2 percent may be approved, but it is recommended that the detector be designed to give indications of as high as 4 percent methane. The indications for these percentages shall be within the limits of error specified in the following table:
            
              Allowable Variations in Scale Reading
              [In percent]

                4.30
              
            

            (i) Tests shall be made at several percentages within the range of the indicating detector and at temperatures between the limits of 50° and 70 °F. by increments of 5°. Ten determinations shall be made at each percentage. Neither the average of the 10 readings nor more than 2 readings for each percentage shall exceed the limits of error given in the table.
            
            (ii) The average number of determinations that may be made with an indicating detector without replacement of any part shall be not less than 30, and the average number that may be made without recharging the battery shall be not less than 15.
            (iii) The scale shall not be subdivided into smaller divisions than the general accuracy of the indicating detector warrants.
            (3) Mechanical strength. Detectors and indicating detectors shall be subjected to the following mechanical tests: Four of each of those parts or groups of assembled parts that are not normally strapped to the user shall be dropped 20 times on a wood floor from a height of 3 feet. Parts that are strapped to the user may be subjected to a jarring or bumping test to demonstrate adequate strength. The average number of times that any one of the detectors can be dropped before breakage or material distortion of essential parts shall be not less than 10.
            (e) Attachments for illumination. If detectors are provided with attachments for illuminating purposes, such attachments shall be subject to the same requirements as those applying to that type of lamp under the lamp schedule then in force.
          
          
            § 22.8
            Material required for MSHA records.
            In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, it keeps detailed records covering each investigation. These records include drawings and actual equipment as follows:
            (a) Drawings. The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted to show the details of the detector as approved, are retained. These drawings are used to identify the detector in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
            (b) Actual equipment. If MSHA so desires, parts of the detectors that are used in the tests will be retained as records of the equipment submitted. If the detector is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer to submit one of his detectors, with the approval plate attached, as a record of his commercial product.
          
          
            § 22.9
            How approvals are granted.
            All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A detector will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers have judged that it has met the requirements of the schedule and MSHA's records are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the detector as it is to be commercially made. No verbal reports of the investigation will be given and no informal approvals will be granted. As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval, he shall be free to advertise his detector as permissible.

            § 22.10
            Approval plate.
            (a) Attachment to be made by manufacturers. (1) Manufacturers shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on each permissible methane detector. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mines Safety and Health Administration and be inscribed as follows:
            
            
              Permissible Methane Detector (or Permissible Methane Indicating Detector) Approval No. ___ issued to the _______ Company.
            
            
            (2) When deemed necessary, an appropriate caution statement shall be added. The size and position of the approval plate shall be satisfactory to MSHA.
            (b) Purpose of approval plate. The approval plate is a label that identifies the device so that anyone can tell at a glance whether it is of the permissible type or not. By the plate, the manufacturer can point out that his detector complies with MSHA's requirements and that it has been approved for use in gassy mines.
            (c) Use of approval plate. Permission to place MSHA's approval plate on his detector obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of his product and to see that each detector is constructed according to the drawings that have been accepted by MSHA and are in MSHA's files. Detectors exhibiting changes in design that have not been approved are not permissible and must not bear MSHA's approval plate.
            (d) Withdrawal of approval. MSHA reserves the right to rescind for cause at any time any approval granted under this part.
            [Sched. 8C, Oct. 31, 1935, as amended at 43 FR 12315, Mar. 24, 1978]
          
          
            § 22.11
            Instructions on handling future changes in design.
            All approvals are granted with the understanding that the manufacturer will make the detector according to the drawings submitted to MSHA which have been considered and included in the approval. Therefore, when the manufacturer desires to make any changes in the design, the manufacturer should first obtain MSHA's approval of the change. The procedure is as follows:
            (a)(1) The manufacturer must write to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, requesting an extension of the original approval and stating the change or changes desired. With this request, the manufacturer should submit a revised drawing or drawings showing changes in detail, together with one of each of the parts affected.
            (2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application:
            (i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
            (ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
            (iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and
            (iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.
            (b) MSHA will consider the application and inspect the drawings and parts to determine whether it will be necessary to make any tests.
            (c) If no tests are necessary, the applicant will be advised of the approval or disapproval of the change by letter from MSHA.
            (d) If tests are judged necessary, the applicant will be advised of the material that will be required.

            § 23.6
            General requirements for approval.
            Telephones and signaling devices shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for conditions of underground service. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard under normal operation if use in gassy or dusty mine atmospheres.
          
          
            § 23.7
            Specific requirements for approval.
            (a) The circuits external to telephones and signal devices shall be intrinsically safe; that is, the electrical design and construction of telephones and signal devices shall be such that neither contact between wires comprising the external circuits nor contact of tools or other metal objects with external terminals and circuits will result in electrical sparks capable of igniting explosive methane-air mixtures (or such mixtures with coal dust in suspension) during normal operation of the telephones or signal devices.
            (b) All parts which, during normal operation, are capable of producing sparks that might ignite explosive methane-air mixtures shall be enclosed in explosion-proof compartments. All openings in the casings of such compartments shall be adequately protected. It is desirable that openings be as few as possible. All joints in the casings of an explosion-proof compartment shall be metal-to-metal so designed as to have a width of contact, measured along the shortest path from the inside to the outside of the compartment, of not less than 1 inch if the unoccupied volume (air space) in the compartment is more than 60 cubic inches. For unoccupied volume of 60 cubic inches or less, a 3/8-inch width of contact will be acceptable.

            (c) All bolts and screw holes shall be “blind” or bottomed if the omission of a bolt or screw would otherwise leave an opening into the compartment. An adequate lock or seal shall be provided to prevent tampering and exposure of spark-producing parts by unauthorized persons.
            (d) Battery cells shall be placed in an explosion-proof compartment or else in one that is locked or sealed, and the terminals and the connections thereto shall be so arranged and protected as to preclude meddling, tampering, or making other electrical connections with them.
            (e) Manufacturers shall furnish adequate instructions for the installation and connection of telephones and signal devices in order that the safety of these devices and other circuits shall not be diminished by improper installation. MSHA reserves the right to require the attachment of wiring diagrams to the cases of telephones and signal devices.
            (f) If electric light bulbs are used in signaling devices, they shall be either equipped with effective safety devices, such as are required for permissible electric mine lamps, 1
               or enclosed in explosion-proof compartments.
            
              
                1 In this case, the requirements of the current schedule for mine lamps will apply.
            

            (g) Line powered telephones and signaling devices or systems shall be equipped with standby power sources that have the capacity to enable the devices or systems to continue functioning in the event the line power fails or is cut off. Manufacturers shall furnish instructions for the proper maintenance of standby power sources.

            § 23.8
            Inspection and tests.
            (a) A thorough inspection of the telephone or signaling device will be made to determine its adequacy and permisibility. Tests may be made to check the electrical characteristics and constants of the various parts, and determine the adequacy of the insulation and other parts of features of the device.
            (b) In addition, compartments of explosion-proof design will be tested while filled and surrounded with explosive mixtures containing varying percentages of Pittsburgh natural gas 2
               and air, the mixture within the compartment being ignited by a spark plug or other suitable means. For some of the tests bituminous-coal dust will be introduced into the compartment in addition to the explosive mixtures, and the effects will be noted. A sufficient number of tests will be made under the foregoing conditions to determine the ability of the compartment to retain flame without bursting. Even though the surrounding mixtures are not ignited, the compartment will not be considered as having passed the tests, if flames are discharged from any joint or opening; if excessive pressures are developed or if serious distortion of the compartment walls take place.
            
              
                2 Investigation has shown that for test purposes Pittsburgh natural gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory substitute for pure methane.
            
          
          
            § 23.9
            Special requirements for complete devices.

            (a) Without the approval plate, mentioned hereafter.
            (b) With unprotected openings in any of the explosion-proof compartments. This condition refers to any openings in these compartments, but especially to those equipped with removable covers.
            (c) If not complete with all of the parts considered in the approval.
            (d) If installed or connected otherwise than in accordance with the instructions furnished by the manufacturer.
            (e) If modified in any manner not authorized by MSHA.
          
          
            § 23.10
            Material required for MSHA records.

            In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, it keeps detailed records covering each investigation. These records include drawings and actual equipment as follows:
            
            (a) Drawings. The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted, to show the details of the device as approved. These drawings are used to identify the device in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
            (b) Actual equipment. If MSHA so desires, parts of the devices that are used in the tests will be retained as records of the equipment submitted. If the device is approved, MSHA reserves the right to require the manufacturer to submit one, with the approval plate attached and without cost to MSHA, as a record of his commercial product.
          
          
            § 23.11
            How approvals are granted.
            All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A device will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers have judged that it has met the requirements of the part and MSHA's records are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the device as it is to be commercially made. Individual parts of devices will not be approved. No verbal reports of the investigation will be given and no informal approvals will be granted. As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval, he shall be free to advertise his device as permissible.
            [Sched. 9B, 4 FR 1555, Apr. 11, 1939, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2975, May 4, 1955]
          
          
            § 23.12
            Wording, purpose, and use of approval plate.

              [Sched. 25B, 25 FR 6473, July 9, 1960, as amended at 39 FR 24005, June 28, 1974]
            
            
              § 33.9
              Certification of dust-collecting systems.
              Manufacturers of dust-collecting systems that are designed for integral use on machines with drilling equipment may apply to MSHA to issue a certificate of performance for such systems. To qualify for a certificate of performance, the dust-collecting system shall have met satisfactorily the test requirements of Subpart C under specified operating conditions, such as type of drilling equipment, drilling speed, and power requirements and the construction thereof shall be adequately covered by specifications and drawings officially recorded and filed with MSHA. Individual parts of dust-collecting systems will not be certified for performance. Certificates of performance may be cited to fabricators of combination units as evidence that further inspection and testing of the dust-collecting system will not be required, provided the dust-collecting requirements of the drilling equipment do not exceed the limits of performance for which the system was certified. Since MSHA does not sanction the use of the words “permissible” or “approved” except as applying to completely assembled equipment, dust-collecting systems, which have been certified only as to performance, shall not be advertised or labeled in a manner inferring that such systems themselves are permissible or approved by MSHA. However, a certified system may be advertised as suitable for use on combination units for which certification may be desired if the limits of its performance are cited. Certified dust-collecting systems shall bear labels or tags which shall contain the following: “Performance-tested Dust Collecting, System, MSHA File No. P/T____,” and name of manufacturer, identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts, and description of the limitations for which performance is certified. MSHA will assign a P/T file number in the certification letter.
            
            
              § 33.10
              Certificates of approval or performance.
              (a) Upon completion of an investigation, MSHA will issue to the applicant either a certificate or a written notice of disapproval, as they case may require. No informal notification of approval will be issued. If a certificate is issued, no test data or detailed results of tests will accompany it. If a notice of disapproval is issued, it will be accompanied by details of the defects, with a view to possible correction. MSHA will not disclose, except to the applicant, any information on a unit or system upon which a notice of disapproval has been issued.
              (b) A certificate will be accompanied by a list of the drawings and specifications covering the details of design and construction of the unit or system, including the electrical parts, if applicable, upon which the certificate is based. Applicants shall keep exact duplicates of the drawings and specifications submitted and the list of drawing numbers referred to in § 33.6(d)(1) that relate to the certified unit or system, and these are to be adhered to exactly in production.
            
            
              
              § 33.11
              Approval plates.
              (a) A certificate of approval will be accompanied by a photograph of a design for an approval plate, bearing the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the name of the applicant, the name of the unit, the approval number or space for the approval number (or numbers if permissibility of electrical parts is involved), spaces for the type and the serial numbers of the unit, conditions of approval, and identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts. When deemed necessary by MSHA, an appropriate statement shall be added, giving the precautions to be observed in maintaining the unit in an approved condition.
              (b) An approval plate for a unit designed for use in a nongassy coal mine shall state that any electrical parts are not certified for use in a gassy coal mine. (See § 33.38(c).)
              (c) The applicant shall reproduce the design either as a separate plate or by stamping or molding it in some suitable place on each unit to which it relates. The size, type, and method of attaching and location of an approval plate are subject to the approval of MSHA. The method of affixing the plate shall not impair the dust-collection or explosion-proof features of the unit.
              (d) The approval plate identifies the unit, to which it is attached, as permissible, and is the applicant's guarantee that the unit complies with the requirements of this part. Without an approval plate, no unit has the status of “permissible” under the provisions of this part.
              (e) Use of the approval plate obligates the applicant to whom the certificate of approval was granted to maintain the quality of each unit bearing it and guarantees that it is manufactured and assembled according to the drawings and specifications upon which a certificate of approval was based. Use of the approval plate is not authorized except on units that conform strictly with the drawings and specifications upon which the certificate of approval was based.

              If an applicant desires to change any feature of a certified unit or system, he shall first obtain MSHA's approval of the change, pursuant to the following procedure:
              (a)(1) Application shall be made as for an original certificate, requesting that the existing certification be extended to cover the proposed changes, and shall be accompanied by drawings, specifications, and related data showing the changes in detail.
              (2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application:
              (i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
              (ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
              (iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and
              (iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.
              (b) The application will be examined by MSHA to determine whether inspection and testing will be required. Testing will be necessary if there is a possibility that the modification may affect adversely the performance of the unit or system. MSHA will inform the applicant whether such testing is required and the components or materials to be submitted for that purpose.

              (c) If the proposed modification meets the requirements of this part and Part 18 of Subchapter D of this chapter (Bureau of Mines Schedule 2, revised, the current revision of which is Schedule 2F) if applicable, a formal extension of certification will be issued, accompanied by a list of new and corrected drawings and specifications to be added to those already on file as the basis for the extension of certification.

            Subpart B—Test Requirements
            
              § 35.20
              Autogenous-ignition temperature test.
              (a) Purpose. The purpose of this test, referred to hereinafter as the ignition-temperature test, is to determine the lowest autogenous-ignition temperature of a hydraulic fluid at atmospheric pressure when using the syringe-injection method.
              (b) Description of apparatus—(1) Test flask. The test flask, which is heated and into which the test sample is injected, shall be a commercial 200 ml. borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flask.
              (2) Thermocouples. Calibrated thermocouples—iron-constantan or chromelalumel—and a potentiometer shall be used for all temperature measurements.
              (3) Syringe. A hypodermic syringe (0.25 or 1 cc. capacity) equipped with a 2-inch No. 18 stainless steel needle and calibrated in hundredths of a cubic centimeter (0.01 cc.) shall be used to inject samples into the heated test flask.
              (4) Timer. An electric timer or stopwatch calibrated in not more than 0.2 second intervals shall be used to determine the time lag before ignition.
              
                Note:
                Time lag is the time that elapses between the instant of injection and that of ignition of the test sample, as evidenced by flame.
              
              (5) Furnace. The furnace in which the ignition-temperature test is conducted shall consist of a refractory (alundum or equivalent) cylinder 5 inches in internal diameter and 5 inches in height; a transite-ring top and a transite-disk bottom, each of which is attached to a metal cylinder. The furnace is heated by three elements as follows: (i) A circumferential heater embedded in the refractory cylinder; (ii) a top or toroidal-neck heater that surrounds the neck of the test flask; and (iii) a flat base heater on which the test flask rests. The temperature of each heating element shall be controlled independently by an autotransformer. Means shall be provided for applying thermocouples at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask, which shall be inserted upright in the furnace.
              (c) Test procedures—(1) Temperature control. Each autotransformer shall be so adjusted that the temperature at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask is uniform within ±2 °F. of the desired test temperature.
              (2) Sample injection and timing. A 0.07 cc. test sample shall be injected into the heated test flask with the hypodermic syringe, and the syringe shall be withdrawn immediately. Measurement of time shall start at the instant the sample is injected.
              (3) Observations. (i) If flame does not result in 5 minutes or more after injection of the test sample, the sample shall be considered nonflammable at the test temperature, and the timer shall be stopped. The test flask shall then be flushed well with clean dry air and, after a lapse of 15 minutes or more, the test shall be repeated with the test flask temperature raised 50 °F. ±2 °F. above the first test temperature.
              (ii) If ignition (flame) is observed in 5 minutes or less after the injection of the test sample (0.07 cc.), the time lag (time interval) shall be noted. After an ignition occurs the temperature of the test flask shall be reduced 5 °F., and the test procedure repeated in decrements of 5 °F. until ignition no longer occurs and this temperature shall be noted as the first nonignition test temperature for the 0.07 cc. sample.
              (iii) The temperature shall be increased 50 °F. ±2 °F. above the first nonignition test temperature, and the ignition-temperature test procedure shall be repeated with a 0.10 cc. test sample injected into the heated test flask.
              (iv) If the lowest temperature at which ignition occurs with the 0.10 cc. sample (in decrements of 5 °F.) is lower than that obtained with the 0.07 cc. sample, the ignition-temperature test procedure shall be repeated using a test sample of 0.12 cc., then 0.15 cc., and so on by increments of 0.03 cc. until the lowest ignition temperature is obtained.
              (v) If the lowest temperature at which ignition is obtained with the 0.10 cc. sample is greater than that obtained with the 0.07 cc. sample, the ignition temperature test procedure shall be repeated by reducing the test sample to 0.05 cc. and then to 0.03 cc. until the lowest ignition temperature is obtained.
              (d) Appraisal of test. A fluid shall be considered fire-resistant, according to the test requirements of this section: Provided, That in no instance of the ignition-temperature test procedure, as stated in this section, shall the ignition temperature of the test sample be less than 600 °F.
            
            
              § 35.21
              Temperature-pressure spray-ignition tests.
              (a) Purpose. The purpose of this test shall be to determine the flammability of a hydraulic fluid when it is sprayed over three different sources of ignition which are described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (b) Description of apparatus. (1) A 3-quart pressure vessel, with the necessary connections, valves, and heating elements, shall be used for containing and heating the fluid under the test conditions as specified hereinafter.
              (2) An atomizing round-spray nozzle, having a discharge orifice of 0.025-inch diameter, capable of discharging 3.28 gallons of water per hour with a spray angle of 90 degrees at a pressure of 100 p.s.i., shall be connected to the pressure vessel.

              (3) A commercial pressurized cylinder, containing nitrogen with the customary regulators, valves, tubing, and connectors, shall be used to supply nitrogen to the pressure vessel described in paragraph (b) (1) of this section.
              
              (4) Three igniting devices shall provide three different sources of ignition as follows:
              (i) A metal trough with a metal cover in which cotton waste soaked in kerosene is ignited.
              (ii) An electric arcing device in which the arc is produced by a 12,000-volt transformer.
              (iii) A propane torch—Bernzomatic or equivalent.
              (5) A means of measuring distances from the nozzle tip to the igniting device shall be provided.
              (c) Test procedures. (1) A 21/2-quart sample of the fluid shall be poured into the pressure vessel and heated to a temperature of 150 °F. The temperature shall be maintained at not less than 145 °F. or not more than 155 °F. during the test.
              (2) Nitrogen shall be introduced into the vessel at 150 p.s.i.g.
              (3) The fluid shall be sprayed at each igniting device, described in paragraph (b) (4) of this section, which is moved along the trajectory of the spray. Each igniting device shall be held in the spray at different distances from the nozzle tip for one minute or until the flame or arc is extinguished (if less than one minute) to determine this fire-resistant characteristic of the fluid.
              (d) Appraisal of tests. If the test procedures in paragraph (c) of this section do not result in an ignition of any sample of fluid or if an ignition of a sample does not result in flame propagation for a time interval not exceeding 6 seconds at a distance of 18 inches or more from the nozzle tip to the center of each igniting device, it shall be considered fire resistant, according to the test requirements of this section.
            
            
              § 35.22
              Test to determine effect of evaporation on flammability.
              (a) Purpose. The purpose of this test shall be to determine the effect of evaporation on the reduction of fire resistance of a hydraulic fluid.
              (b) Description of apparatus—(1) Petri dish. Standard laboratory Petri dishes, approximately 90 mm. by 16 mm., shall be used to contain the test samples.
              (2) Oven. A gravity convection air oven, capable of maintaining the specified evaporation temperature constant within ±2 °F., shall be used in the test.
              (3) Pipe cleaner. An ordinary smoker's pipe cleaner (U.S. Tobacco Co., Dill's or equivalent) shall be used in the test procedure, described in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Test procedures. (1) Three 30-milliliter samples of the fluid shall be placed in uncovered Petri dishes. Two of these samples shall be inserted in the oven, that shall have been heated to a temperature of 150 °F., ±2 °F., which shall be maintained throughout this test. The third sample shall remain at room temperature.
              (2) An electrically operated cycling device, such as an automobile windshield wiper mechanism, shall be oscillated in a horizontal plane, 25 ±2 cycles per minute. A pipe cleaner shall be attached to the device so that it will enter and leave a flame of a standard (Bunsen or equivalent) laboratory burner, which is adjusted to provide a nonluminous flame approximately 4 inches in height without forming a sharp inner cone. The cycling device shall be so arranged that when a 2-inch length of pipe cleaner is attached thereto the exposed end shall describe an arc with a radius of 4 inches ±1/8 inch. The cycling device shall be so arranged that when the 2-inch length of pipe cleaner is attached thereto, its midpoint shall be in the center of the flame at one extreme end of the cycle.
              (3) Each of five 2-inch lengths of pipe cleaner shall be soaked separately for a period of 2 minutes in the test sample that remained at room temperature. Each pipe cleaner shall then be removed from the test sample and permitted to drain freely until all excess fluid is expelled from it. Each soaked pipe cleaner shall be attached to the cycling device, the mechanism started, and the pipe cleaner permitted to enter and leave the burner flame, as described in paragraph (c) (2) of this section, until a self-sustaining flame shall be observed on the pipe cleaner. The number of cycles necessary to obtain a self-sustaining flame shall be noted and averaged for each of the five soaked pipe cleaners.

              (4) After one test sample has remained in the oven for a period of 2 hours, the Petri dish containing it shall be removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature, after which 5 lengths of 2-inch pipe cleaner shall be soaked separately in the test sample for a period of 2 minutes. Then the test procedure stated in paragraph (c) (3) of this section shall be repeated.
              (5) After one test sample has remained in the oven for a period of 4 hours, the Petri dish containing it shall be removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature, after which 5 lengths of 2-inch pipe cleaner shall be soaked separately in the test sample for a period of 2 minutes. Then the test procedure stated in paragraph (c) (3) of this section shall be repeated.
              (d) Appraisal of tests. To be determined as fire resistant according to the test requirements of this section, the three following results shall be achieved:
              (1) The average number of cycles before attaining a self-sustaining flame in the test described in paragraph (c) (3) of this section shall be 24 or more.
              (2) The average number of cycles before attaining a self-sustaining flame in the test described in paragraph (c) (4) of this section shall be 18 or more.
              (3) The average number of cycles before attaining a self-sustaining flame in the test described in paragraph (c) (5) of this section shall be 12 or more.
            
            
              § 35.23
              Performance required for certification.
              To qualify as fire-resistant under the regulations of this part, a hydraulic fluid shall meet each performance requirement and stated in §§ 35.20(d), 35.21(d), and 35.22(d).

The flame arrester shall be of rugged construction to withstand the effects of repeated explosions within the exhaust system, and the material of construction shall resist deterioration in service. It shall be so mounted in the equipment assembly that it is protected from accidental external damage.
              (2) A spaced-plate flame arrester for the exhaust system shall meet the same requirements as flame arresters for the intake system (see § 36.23(b)(2)).
              (3) In lieu of a space-place flame arrester, an exhaust-gas cooling box or conditioner may be used as the exhaust flame arrester provided that explosion tests demonstrate that the cooling box will arrest flame. When used as a flame arrester the cooling box shall be equipped with a device to shut off automatically the fuel supply to the engine at a safe minimum water level. A cooling box used as a flame arrester shall withstand repeated explosion tests without permanent deformation. It shall be constructed of material, satisfactory to MSHA, that will resist deterioration in service.
              (c) Exhaust cooling system. (1) A cooling system shall be provided for the engine exhaust gas. The heat-dissipation capacity shall be capable of reducing the temperature of the undiluted exhaust gas to less than 170 °F. at the point of discharge from the cooling system under any condition of engine operation acceptable to MSHA. A device shall be provided that will automatically shut off the fuel supply to the engine immediately if the temperature of the exhaust gas exceeds 185 °F. at the point of discharge from the cooling system. Provision shall be made, acceptable to MSHA, to prevent restarting the engine after the fuel supply has been shut off automatically until the water supply in the cooling box has been replenished. When the cooling box is used as a flame arrester, one safety device may be accepted provided it controls a safe minimum water level in the cooling box and also prevents the final exhaust temperature from exceeding 185 °F.
              (2) Cooling shall be obtained by passing the exhaust gas through water or a dilute aqueous chemical solution held in a cooling box or conditioner, or by a spray of water or a dilute aqueous chemical solution that will enter the exhaust system near the outlet of the exhaust manifold, or a combination of the two methods. When a spray is used it shall be provided with a filtering device to protect the nozzle from clogging. Provisions shall be made for draining and cleaning all parts of the exhaust cooling system. Openings for draining and cleaning shall be closed and sealed or locked by a method satisfactory to MSHA.
              (3) The cooling system shall be constructed of corrosion-resistant metal suitable for the intended application.
              (4) The cooling system shall store enough water or aqueous solution to permit operation of the engine at one-third load factor for eight hours. The minimum quantity of usable water or aqueous solution available for cooling shall equal the consumption for one hour with the engine operating at maximum load and speed multiplied by 8 and this product divided by 3.
              (d) Surface temperature of engine and exhaust system. (1) The temperature of any external surface of the engine or exhaust system shall not exceed 400 °F. under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA. Water-jacketed components shall have integral jackets and provision shall be made for positive circulation of water in the jackets and to automatically shut off the engine when the temperature in the cooling jacket(s) exceeds 212 °F. Insulated coverings to control surface temperature are not acceptable.
              (2) When a spray is used to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas, it shall be located as near as practicable to the outlet of the exhaust manifold.
              (3) Exterior surfaces of the exhaust system shall be designed to minimize accumulation and lodgement of dust or combustible substances and to permit ready access for cleaning.
              (e) Tightness of exhaust system. All joints in the exhaust system shall be tight to prevent the flow of exhaust gas through them under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA. A tight system shall be obtained by the use of ground joints, or thin metal or metal-clad gaskets. All such joints shall be fitted with adequate through bolts and all gaskets shall be aligned and held firmly in position by the bolts or other suitable means. Such joints shall remain tight to prevent passage of flame or propagation of repeated internal explosions to a surrounding flammable mixture.
              (f) Dilution of exhaust gas. (1) Provision shall be made to dilute the exhaust gas with and before it is discharged into the surrounding atmosphere. The discharged exhaust gas shall be so diluted with air that the mixture shall not contain more than 0.5 percent, by volume, of carbon dioxide; 0.01 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide; 0.0025 percent, by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as equivalent nitrogen dioxide); or 0.0010 percent, by volume, of aldehydes (calculated as equivalent formaldehyde) under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA.
              (2) The final diluted exhaust mixture shall be discharged in such a manner that it is directed away from the operator's compartment and also away from the breathing zones of persons required to be alongside the equipment.
              (g) Pressure-gage connection.

              § 36.44
              Maximum allowable fuel:air ratio.
              (a) When an engine is delivered to MSHA with the fuel-injection system adjusted by the applicant and tests of the exhaust-gas composition (see § 36.43) show not more than 0.30 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide, the applicant's adjustment of the fuel-injection system shall be accepted. The maximum fuel:air ratio determined from the exhaust-gas composition shall be designated as the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio. The maximum liquid fuel rate (pounds per hour) that produces the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio shall be designated as the maximum allowable fuel rate for operating the equipment at elevations not exceeding 1,000 feet above sea level.

              (b) When the carbon monoxide content of the exhaust exceeds 0.30 percent, by volume, only near maximum power output, the maximum fuel:air ratio at which carbon monoxide does not exceed 0.30 percent shall be calculated and designated as the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio. The corresponding calculated liquid fuel rate shall be designated as the maximum allowable fuel rate at elevations not exceeding 1,000 feet above sea level.
              
              
                Note:
                The applicant may be requested to adjust the liquid fuel rate during tests to determine the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio.
              
              
              
              (c) The maximum allowable fuel:air ratio and maximum liquid fuel rates shall be used to calculate a liquid fuel rate-altitude table that shall govern the liquid fuel rate of engines operated at elevations exceeding 1,000 feet above sea level.
            
            
              § 36.45
              Quantity of ventilating air.
              (a) Results of the engine tests shall be used to calculate ventilation (cubic feet of air per minute) that shall be supplied by positive air movement when the permissible mobile diesel-powered transportation equipment is used underground. This quantity shall be stamped on the approval plate. The quantity so determined shall apply when only one machine is operated.

              (b) Determination of the ventilation rate shall be based upon dilution of the exhaust gas with normal air. The most undesirable and hazardous condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA shall be used in the calculations. The concentration of any of the following individual constituents in the diluted mixture shall not exceed:
              
              
                0.25 percent, by volume, of carbon dioxide (CO2).

                0.00125 percent, by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as equivalent nitrogen dioxide, NO2).
              
              
              The oxygen (O2) content of the diluted mixture shall be not less than 20 percent, by volume. The maximum quantity of normal air to produce the above dilution shall be designated the ventilation rate.
              
              
                Note:
                This ventilation rate will provide a factor of safety for exposure of persons to air mixtures containing harmful or objectionable gases and for minor variations in engine performance.
              
            
            
              § 36.46
              Explosion tests of intake and exhaust systems.
              (a) Explosion tests to determine the strength of the intake and exhaust systems to withstand internal explosions and the adequacy of the flame arresters to prevent the propagation of an explosion shall be made with the systems connected to the engine or the systems simulated as connected to the engine. The system shall be filled with and surrounded by an explosive natural gas-air mixture. The mixture within the intake and exhaust systems shall be ignited by suitable means and the internal pressure developed by the resultant explosion shall be determined. Tests shall be conducted with the ignition source in several different locations to determine the maximum pressure developed by an internal explosion.
              (b) Explosion tests shall be made with the engine at rest and with the flammable natural gas-air mixtures in the intake and exhaust systems. In other tests with the flammable mixture in motion, the engine shall be driven (externally) at speeds prescribed by MSHA but no liquid fuel shall be supplied to the injection valves.
              (c) The temperature of the flame arresters in the intake or exhaust systems shall not exceed 212 °F. when an explosion test is conducted. Any water-spray cooling for the exhaust system shall not be operated and water shall not be present in the exhaust cooling boxes except when water is the cooling agent for a cooling box designed to act as a flame arrester, in which case MSHA will prescribe the test conditions.
              (d) The explosion tests of the intake and exhaust systems shall not result in:
              (1) Discharge of visible flame from any joint or opening.
              (2) Ignition of surrounding flammable gas-air mixture.
              (3) Development of dangerous afterburning. 4

              § 36.47
              Tests of exhaust-gas cooling system.

              (a) The adequacy of the exhaust-gas cooling system and its components shall be determined with the engine operating at the maximum allowable liquid fuel rate and governed speed with 0.5 ±0.1 percent, by volume, of natural gas in the intake air mixture. All parts of the engine and exhaust-gas cooling system shall be at their respective equilibrium temperatures. The cooling spray, if any, shall be operated, and all compartments designed to hold cooling water shall be filled with the quantity of water recommended by the applicant. No cooling air shall be circulated over the engine or components in the cooling system during the test.
              (b) Determinations shall be made during the test to establish the cooling performance of the system, the cooling water consumption, high-water level when the system sprays excess water, and low-water level when the cooling system fails.
              (c) The final exhaust-gas temperature at discharge from the cooling system, and before the exhaust gas is diluted with air, shall not exceed 170 °F. or the temperature of adiabatic saturation, if this temperature is lower.
              (d) Water consumed in cooling the exhaust gas under the test conditions shall not exceed by more than 15 percent that required for adiabatic saturation of the exhaust-gas at the final temperature. Water in excess of that required for adiabatic saturation shall be considered as entrained water. Enough water shall be available in the cooling system or in reserve supply compartments for sustained satisfactory operation for at least 22/3 hours under the test conditions.
              
                Note:
                This amount is enough to cool the exhaust for an 8-hour shift at one-third load factor.
              
              (e) The adequacy of the automatic fuel shutoff actuated by the temperature of the final exhaust shall be determined with the engine operating under test conditions by withdrawing water until the cooling system fails to function. The final exhaust-gas temperature at which the liquid fuel to the engine is automatically shut off shall be noted. This temperaure shall not exceed 185 °F.

              (f) Following the automatic fuel shutoff test in paragraph (e) of this section, the temperature of the control point shall be allowed to fall to 170 °F. At this temperature and with the water replenished in the cooling system, it shall be possible to start the engine.
              
              
                Note:
                If the cooling system includes a reserve supply water tank, the line or lines connecting it to the cooling compartment may require a suitable flame arrester.
              
              
              (g) The effectiveness of the automatic engine shut-off, which will operate when the water in the cooling jacket(s) exceeds 212 °F., shall be determined by causing the jacket temperature to exceed 212 °F.

              (a) The surface temperatures of the engine, exhaust cooling system, and other components subject to heating by engine operation shall be determined with the engine operated as prescribed by MSHA. All parts of the engine, cooling system, and other components shall have reached their respective equilibrium temperatures. The exhaust cooling system shall be operated, but air shall not be circulated over the engine or components. Surface temperatures shall be measured at various places prescribed by MSHA to determine where maximum temperatures develop.

              (b) The temperature of any surface shall not exceed 400 °F.
              
              
                Note to § 36.48:
                The engine may be operated under test conditions prescribed by MSHA while completely surrounded by a flammable mixture. MSHA reserves the right to apply combustible materials to any surface for test. Operation under such conditions shall not ignite the flammable mixture.

              The performance and adequacy of the exhaust-gas dilution system shall be determined in tests of the complete equipment. The engine, at temperature equilibrium, shall be operated in normal air as prescribed by MSHA. Samples of the undiluted exhaust gas and of the diluted exhaust gas, at location(s) prescribed by MSHA, shall be considered with the data obtained from the engine test (see § 36.43) to determine that the concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and aldehydes in the diluted exhaust shall be below the required concentrations specified in § 36.25(f)(1).

              As used in this part:
              (a) Operator means any owner, lessee, or other person who operates, controls, or supervises a coal or other mine or any designated independent contractor performing services or construction at such mine.
              (b) Person means any individual, sole proprietor, partnership, association, corporation, firm, subsidiary of a corporation, or other organization.
              (c) Coal or other mine means (a) an area of land from which minerals are extracted in nonliquid form or, if in liquid form, are extracted with workers underground, (b) private ways and roads appurtenant to such area, and (c) lands, excavations, underground passageways, shafts, slopes, tunnels and workings, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools, or other property including impoundments, retention dams, and tailings ponds, on the surface or underground, used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting such minerals from their natural deposits in nonliquid form, or if in liquid form, with workers underground, or used in, or to be used in, the milling of such minerals, or the work of preparing coal or other minerals, and includes custom coal preparation facilities. In making a determination of what constitutes mineral milling for purposes of this act, the Secretary shall give due consideration to the convenience of administration resulting from the delegation to one Assistant Secretary of all authority with respect to the health and safety of miners employed at one physical establishment.

              (e) If the operator is any organization other than a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, the operator shall state: (1) The nature and type, or legal identity of the organization; (2) the name and address of the mine and the Federal mine identification number; (3) the name and address of the person at the mine in charge of health and safety; (4) the name and address of the person with overall responsibility for a health and safety program at all of the operator's mines, if the operator is not directly involved in the daily operation of the mine; (5) the Federal mine identification numbers of all other mines in which the organization has a 20 percent or greater ownership interest; (6) the full name, address of record and telephone number of the organization; (7) the name and address of each individual who has an ownership interest in the organization; (8) the name and address of the principal organization officials or members; and (9) the Federal mine identification numbers of all other mines in which any official or member has a 20 percent or greater ownership interest.

              Failure of the operator to notify the Mine Safety and Health Administration, in writing, of the legal identity of the operator or any changes thereof within the time required under this part will be considered to be a violation of section 109(d) of the Act and shall be subject to penalties as provided in section 110 of the Act.

              Legal identity report.
              Each operator of a coal or other mine shall file notification of legal identity and every change thereof with the appropriate district manager of the Mine Safety and Health Administration by properly completing, mailing, or otherwise delivering form 2000-7 “legal identity report” which shall be provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration for this purpose.

              Address of record and telephone number.
              The address of record and telephone number required under this part shall be considered the operator's official address and telephone number for purposes of the Act. Service of documents upon the operator may be proved by a post office return receipt showing that the documents could not be delivered to such operator at the address of record because the operator had moved without leaving a forwarding address or because delivery was not accepted at that address, or because no such address existed. However, operators may request service by delivery to another appropriate address provided by the operator. The telephone number required under this part will be used in connection with proposed civil penalty assessments as provided in 30 CFR part 100.

The notice shall be reduced to writing and signed by the miners' representative or miner, and a copy that does not reveal the name of the person giving the notice must be served on the operator no later than at the time of the inspection. If the Secretary determines that a violation or danger does not exist, he must so notify the miners' representative or miner in writing.
              (b) Under section 103(g)(2) of the Act, a representative of miners or, if there is no such representative, a miner, may notify in writing an authorized representative of the Secretary who is on mine premises prior to or during an inspection, of any violation or imminent danger which he or she has reason to believe exists in the mine. There shall be procedures for the informal review of any refusal by the Secretary's authorized representative to issue a citation with respect to such alleged violation or danger, including notification to the miners' representative or miner of the reasons for his disposition of the case.

              (a) A representative of miners or, where there is no such representative, a miner, who has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the act or a mandatory health or safety standard exists, or that an imminent danger exists, may obtain a special inspection by giving notice to the Secretary or any authorized representative of the Secretary of such violation or danger.
              (b) Any such notice shall set forth the alleged violation or imminent danger and the location of such violation or danger and shall be reduced to a writing signed by the representative of miners or miner giving such notice.

              (c) A copy of such written notice shall be provided to the operator or his agent by the Secretary or his authorized representative no later than the time that the inspection begins. In addition, if the notice indicates that an imminent danger exists, the operator or his agent shall be notified as quickly as possible of the alleged danger. The name of the person giving such notice and the names of any individual miners referred to therein shall not appear in the copy of the written notice or in a notification provided to the operator.
            
            
              § 43.5
              Action by the Secretary.
              (a) As soon as possible after the receipt of a notice of alleged violation or imminent danger under this subpart, the Secretary or his authorized representative shall make a special inspection to determine if a citation or withdrawal order should be issued, unless on the face of the notice, the condition complained of, even if it were found to exist, would clearly not constitute a violation or imminent danger.
              (b) Where the Secretary or his authorized representative makes a special inspection under this subpart and finds a violation or imminent danger, a citation or withdrawal order, as appropriate, shall be issued.
            
            
              § 43.6
              Notice of negative finding.
              (a) If it is determined that a special inspection is not warranted, a written notice of negative finding shall be issued as soon as possible following such determination.
              (b) If it is determined that an inspection is warranted and upon such inspection it is determined that neither a citation nor a withdrawal order should be issued for the alleged violation or imminent danger, a written notice of negative finding shall be issued by the authorized representative of the Secretary prior to leaving the mine premises.
              (c) Any notice of negative finding issued under this part shall be issued to the representative of miners or miner seeking the special inspection and a copy shall be served upon the operator.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Informal Review
            
              § 43.7
              Informal review upon written notice given to an inspector on the mine premises.
              (a) A representative of miners or, where there is no such representative, a miner, who has reason to believe that a violation of the Act or a mandatory health or safety standard exists, or an imminent danger exists, may notify an authorized representative of the Secretary in writing prior to or during an inspection conducted by such representative of any violation of the Act or mandatory health or safety standard or of any imminent danger which he or she has reason to believe exists in the mine being inspected. Where the authorized representative or the Secretary refuses to issue a citation or order with respect to such alleged violation or imminent danger, the representative of miners or miner may obtain review of such refusal in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
              (b) A request for informal review shall be sent in writing to the appropriate district manager within 10 days of the date of the refusal to issue a citation or order and shall be accompanied by any supporting information the person requesting review wishes to submit.
              (c) After receipt of the request for informal review, the district manager or his agent may hold, at his or her discretion, an informal conference where the person requesting review can present his views.
              (d) After review of all written and oral statements submitted, the district manager may either affirm the refusal to issue a citation or order or may direct that a new inspection be conducted with respect to the alleged violation or imminent danger. The district manager shall furnish the person requesting review with a written statement of the reasons for his or her final disposition of the request as soon thereafter as possible. A copy of such statement shall be furnished the operator. The district manager's determination in the matter shall be final.
            
            
              § 43.8
              Informal review upon issuance of a notice of negative finding.

              Standard of evaluation of petitions; effect of petitions granted.

              (1) An alternative method of achieving the result of the standard exists that will at all times guarantee no less than the same measure of protection afforded by the standard, or
              (2) Application of the standard will result in a diminution of safety to the miners.
              (b) Except as may be provided in § 44.16 for relief to give effect to a proposed decision and order, a decision of an Administrator or an administrative law judge granting or denying a petition for modification shall not be effective until time for appeal has expired under § 44.14 or § 44.33, as appropriate.

              (c) All petitions for modification granted pursuant to this part shall have only future effect: Provided, That the granting of the modification under this part shall be considered as a factor in the resolution of any enforcement action previously initiated for claimed violation of the subsequently modified mandatory safety standard. Orders granting petitions for modification may contain special terms and conditions to assure adequate protection to miners. The modification, together with any conditions, shall have the same effect as a mandatory safety standard.

              § 44.13
              Proposed decision.
              (a) Upon receipt of a petition for modification, the Mine Safety and Health Administration shall cause an investigation to be made as to the merits of the petition. Any party may request that the investigation of the petition for modification be expedited, or that the time period for investigating the petition be extended. Such requests shall be granted in the discretion of the Administrator upon good cause shown.
              (b) As soon as is practicable after the investigation is completed, the appropriate Administrator shall make a proposed decision and order, which shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. The proposed decision shall become final upon the 30th day after service thereof, unless a request for hearing has been filed with the appropriate Administrator, as provided in § 44.14 of this part.
              (c) Service of the proposed decision is complete upon mailing.

              § 44.14
              Request for hearing.
              A request for hearing filed in accordance with § 44.13 of this part must be filed within 30 days after service of the proposed decision and shall include:
              (a) A concise summary of position on the issues of fact or law desired to be raised by the party requesting the hearing, including specific objections to the proposed decision. A party other than petitioner who has requested a hearing shall also comment upon all issues of fact or law presented in the petition, and
              (b) An indication of a desired hearing site.
              (c) Partial appeal. (1) If the Administrator has issued a proposed decision and order granting the requested modification, a request for hearing on the proposed decision and order may be made by any party based upon objection to one or more of the terms and conditions of the Administrator's proposed decision and order. If such a request for hearing is made, the request should specify which of the terms and conditions should be the subject of the hearing.
              (2) During the pendency of the partial appeal, the proposed decision and order of the Administrator will become final on the 30th day after service thereof, unless a request for hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section by any other party. The decision and order will remain in effect as proposed by the Administrator until the terms and conditions for which the hearing was requested are modified, affirmed, or set aside by a final order of the presiding administrative law judge or the Assistant Secretary. The presiding administrative law judge shall take such action upon a determination of whether—
              (i) The terms and conditions for which the hearing was requested are necessary to ensure that the alternative method of achieving the result of the standard will at all times guarantee to the miners at the mine at least the same measure of protection afforded to the miners at the mine by such standard; or
              (ii) In the case of a petition involving a finding by the Administrator of a diminution of safety to the miners caused by application of the standard at the mine, whether the terms and conditions for which the hearing was requested are necessary to provide equivalent protection to the miners at the mine from the hazard against which the standard is directed.

              § 44.16
              Application for temporary relief; relief to give effect to the proposed decision and order.
              (a) Time for filing. An application for temporary relief from enforcement of a mandatory standard may be filed at any time before a proposed decision and order is issued on a petition for modification and shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding.
              (b) With whom filed. The application shall be filed with and decided by the appropriate Administrator.
              (c) Investigation and decision. Upon receipt of an application for temporary relief, the Administrator shall cause an investigation to be made as to the merits of the application. As soon thereafter as practicable, but in no event greater than 60 days from filing of the application, the Administrator shall issue a decision. If the Administrator does not issue a decision within 60 days of filing of the application, the application shall be deemed to be denied.
              (d) Contents of application. An application for temporary relief shall comply with applicable general requirements of this part, state the specific relief requested, and include specific evidence showing how the applicant meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (e) Criteria. Before temporary relief is granted, the applicant must clearly show that—
              (1) The application was filed in good faith;
              (2) The requested relief will not adversely affect the health or safety of miners in the affected mine;
              (3) An identifiable hazard to miners exists in the mine which is caused by application of the standard at the mine;
              (4) Other means will be used to reasonably address the hazard against which the original standard was designed to protect; and
              (5) Compliance with the standard while the petition for modification is pending will expose miners to the identifiable hazard upon which the application is based.
              (f) Response. All parties to the proceeding in which an application for temporary relief has been filed shall have 15 days from receipt of the application to file a written response with the Administrator.
              (g) Evidence. An application for temporary relief or a response to such an application may be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary matter.
              (h) Findings. Temporary relief may be granted by the Administrator upon a finding that application of the standard at the mine will result in a diminution of safety to the miners at such mine.
              (i) Appeal to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges. If the application for temporary relief is granted by the Administrator, any other party may request a hearing within 15 days of the Administrator's decision. The request shall be addressed to the Administrator and shall be referred by the Administrator, along with the petition for modification, to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with § 44.15. The hearing and decision of the presiding administrative law judge shall be in accordance with subparts C through E of this part. After referral of the petition for modification and application for temporary relief, no further decision shall be rendered by the Administrator.
              (j) Duration of relief. An order granting temporary relief shall be effective until superseded by the Administrator's proposed decision and order, unless a hearing is requested in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. If such hearing is requested, the temporary relief shall remain in effect until modified, affirmed or set aside by the presiding administrative law judge. In no case, however, shall the Administrator's order remain in effect for more than one year, unless renewed or affirmed by the presiding administrative law judge.
              (k) Application for relief to give effect to the proposed decision and order. At any time following the proposed decision and order of the Administrator on the accompanying petition for modification, any party may request relief to give effect to the proposed decision and order until it becomes final.
              (l) An application for relief under paragraph (k) shall be filed with the Administrator and shall include a good faith representation that no party is expected to contest the granting of the petition for modification.
              (m) A decision to grant relief requested under paragraph (k) will take effect on the seventh day following the decision. If a request for hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed in accordance with § 44.14 prior to the seventh day following the granting of such relief, the relief will not become effective. If such request for hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed after relief becomes effective, the relief will expire immediately.

              (b) Disqualification. (1) When an administrative law judge deems himself disqualified to preside over a particular hearing, he shall withdraw therefrom by notice on the record directed to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
              (2) Any party who deems an administrative law judge for any reason to be disqualified to preside or continue to preside over a particular hearing, may file with the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Department of Labor a motion to be supported by affidavits setting forth the alleged grounds for disqualification.

              (c) Contumacious conduct; failure or refusal to appear or obey rulings of a presiding administrative law judge. (1) Contumacious conduct at any hearing before the administrative law judge shall be grounds for exclusion from the hearing.
              (2) If a witness or party refuses to answer a question after being directed to do so or refuses to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the administrative law judge may make such orders with regard to the refusal as are just and appropriate, including an order denying the application of a petitioner or regulating the contents of the record of the hearing.

The administrative law judge may, where appropriate, issue an order which recites the action taken at the conference, amendments allowed to any filed documents, and agreements made between the parties as to any of the matters considered. The order shall limit the issues for hearing to those not disposed of by admissions or agreements. Such an order controls the subsequent course of the hearing, unless modified at the hearing to prevent manifest injustice.

A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age, and the original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be filed with the administrative law judge. A witness may be required to attend a deposition or hearing at a place not more than 100 miles from the place of service.
              (b) If a party's written application for subpoena is submitted 3 working days or less before the hearing to which it relates, a subpoena shall issue at the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or presiding administrative law judge, as appropriate.
              (c) Any person served with a subpoena may move in writing to revoke or modify the subpoena. All motions to revoke or modify shall be served on the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. The administrative law judge shall revoke or modify the subpoena if in his opinion the evidence required to be produced does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings; the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence required to be produced; or if for any other reason, sufficent in law, the subpoena is found to be invalid or unreasonable. The administrative law judge shall make a simple statement of procedural or other grounds for the ruling on the motion to revoke or modify. The motion to revoke or modify, any answer filed thereto, and any ruling thereon shall become a part of the record.
              (d) Witnesses subpoened by any party shall be paid the same fees for attendance and mileage as are paid in the District Courts of the United States. The fees shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witness appears.

              Consent findings and rules or orders.
              (a) General. At any time after a request for hearing is filed in accordance with § 44.14, a reasonable opportunity may be afforded to permit negotiation by the parties of an agreement containing consent findings and a rule or order disposing of the whole or any part of the proceedings. Allowance of such opportunity and the duration thereof shall be in the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, if no administrative law judge has been assigned, or of the presiding administrative law judge. In deciding whether to afford such an opportunity, the administrative law judge shall consider the nature of the proceeding, requirements of the public interest, representations of the parties, and probability of an agreement which will result in a just disposition of the issues involved.
              (b) Contents. Any agreement containing consent findings and rule or order disposing of a proceeding shall also provide:
              (1) That the rule or order shall have the same effect as if made after a full hearing;

              (2) That the record on which any rule or order may be based shall consist of the petition and agreement, and all other pertinent information, including: any request for hearing on the petition; the investigation report; discovery; motions and requests, filed in written form and rulings thereon; any documents or papers filed in connection with prehearing conferences; and, if a hearing has been held, the transcript of testimony and any proposed findings, conclusions, rules or orders, and supporting reasons as may have been filed.
              (3) A waiver of further procedural steps before the administrative law judge and Assistant Secretary; and
              (4) A waiver of any right to challenge or contest the validity of the findings and rule or order made in accordance with the agreement.
              (c) Submission. On or before expiration of the time granted for negotiations, the parties or their counsel may:
              (1) Submit the proposed agreement to the Chief Administrative Law Judge or presiding administrative law judge, as appropriate, for his consideration; or
              (2) Inform the Chief Administrative Law Judge or presiding administrative law judge, as appropriate, that agreement cannot be reached.
              (d) Disposition. In the event an agreement containing consent findings and rule or order is submitted within the time allowed, the Chief Administrative Law Judge or presiding administrative law judge, as appropriate, may accept the agreement by issuing his decision based upon the agreed findings.

            Subpart D—Summary Decisions
            
              § 44.40
              Motion for summary decision.
              (a) Any party may, at least 20 days before the date fixed for any hearing under Subpart C of this part, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary decision on all or any part of the proceeding. Any other party may, within 10 days after service of the motion, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision. The administrative law judge may set the matter for argument and call for submission of briefs.
              (b) Filing of any documents under paragraph (a) of this section shall be with the administrative law judge, and copies of such documents shall be served in accordance with § 44.6 of this part.
              (c) Any affidavits submitted with the motion shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence in a proceeding subject to 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. When a motion for summary decision is made and supported as provided in this section, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of such pleading. Such response must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.
              (d) The administrative law judge may grant the motion if the pleadings, affidavits, material obtained by discovery or otherwise, or matters officially noticed show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and a party is entitled to summary decision. The administrative law judge may deny the motion whenever the moving party denies access to information by means of discovery to a party opposing the motion.
              (e) The denial of all or part of a motion for summary decision by the administrative law judge shall not be subject to interlocutory appeal to the Assistant Secretary unless the administrative law judge certifies in writing that (1) the ruling involves an important question of law or policy as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion, and (2) an immediate appeal from the ruling may materially advance termination of the proceeding. The allowance of an interlocutory appeal shall not stay the proceedings before the administrative law judge unless ordered by the Assistant Secretary.
            
            
              § 44.41
              Summary decision.
              (a) No genuine issue of material fact. (1) Where no genuine issue of a material fact is found to have been raised, the administrative law judge may issue an initial decision to become final 30 days after service thereof, unless, within such time, any party has filed an appeal with the Assistant Secretary. Thereafter, the Assistant Secretary, after consideration of the entire record, may issue a final decision.
              (2) An initial decision and a final decision made under this paragraph shall include a statement of—
              (i) Findings and conclusions, and the reasons therefor, on all issues presented; and

              (ii) Any terms and conditions of the rule or order.
              
              (3) A copy of an initial decision and final decision under this paragraph shall be served on each party.
              (b) Hearings on issues of fact. Where a genuine question of material fact is raised, the administrative law judge shall, and in any other case may, set the case for an evidentiary hearing in accordance with Subpart C of this part.

              § 44.50
              Effect of appeal on initial decision.
              Except as provided in § 44.14(c), a proposed decision and order of an Administrator is not operative pending appeal to an administrative law judge, and a decision of an administrative law judge is not operative pending appeal to the Assistant Secretary.

              § 44.51
              Finality for purposes of judicial review.
              Only a decision by the Assistant Secretary shall be deemed final agency action for purposes of judicial review. A decision by an Administrator or administrative law judge which becomes final for lack of appeal is not deemed final agency action for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.
            
            
              § 44.52
              Revocation of modification.
              (a) Petition for revocation. Any party to a proceeding under this part in which a petition for modification of a mandatory safety standard was granted by an Administrator, administratior law judge, or the Assistant Secretary may petition that the modification be revoked. Such petition shall be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge for disposition.
              (b) Revocation by the Administrator. The appropriate Administrator may propose to revoke a modification previously granted by the Administrator, an administrative law judge, or the Assistant Secretary, by issuing a proposed decision and order revoking the modification. Such proposed revocation and a statement of reasons supporting the proposal must be served upon all parties to the proceeding, and shall become final on the 30th day after service thereof unless a hearing is requested in accordance with § 44.14.
              (c) Revocation of a granted modification must be based upon a change in circumstances or because findings which originally supported the modification are no longer valid.
              (d) Disposition of the revocation shall be subject to all procedures of subparts C through E of this part.

              § 44.53
              Amended modification.
              (a) The Administrator may propose to revise the terms and conditions of a granted modification by issuing an amended proposed decision and order, along with a statement of reasons for the amended proposed decision and order, when one or both of the following occurs:
              (1) A change in circumstances which originally supported the terms and conditions of the modification.
              (2) The Administrator determines that findings which originally supported the terms and conditions of the modification are no longer valid.
              (b) The Administrator's amended proposed decision and order shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding and shall become final upon the 30th day after service thereof, unless a request for hearing on the proposed amendments is filed under § 44.14. If a request for hearing is filed, the amended proposed decision and order shall be subject to all procedures of subparts C through E of this part as if it were a proposed decision and order of the Administrator issued in accordance with § 44.13. The original modification shall remain in effect until superseded by a final amended modification.

              (c) In cases where the original decision and order was based upon an alternative method of achieving the result of the standard, the amended decision and order shall at all times provide to miners at the mine at least the same measure of protection afforded to the miners at the mine by such standard. In cases where the original decision and order was based upon a diminution of safety to the miners resulting from application of the standard at such time, the amended decision and order shall not reduce the protection afforded miners by the original decision and order.

Service of documents upon independent contractors may be proved by a Post Office return receipt showing that the documents were delivered to the address of record or that the documents could not be delivered to the address of record because the independent contractor is no longer at that address and has established no forwarding address; because delivery was not accepted at that address; or because no such address exists. Independent contractors may request service by delivery to another appropriate address of record provided by the independent contractor. The telephone number required under this part will be used in connection with the proposed penalty assessment procedures in 30 CFR part 100.

              (a) Identifies the chemicals at the mine,
              (b) Determines which chemicals are hazardous,
              (c) Establishes a HazCom program, and
              (d) Informs each miner who can be exposed, and other on-site operators whose miners can be exposed, about chemical hazards and appropriate protective measures.
              (e) As of September 23, 2002, all mines employing six or more miners are required to comply with this part.
              (f) As of March 21, 2003, all mines employing five or fewer miners are required to comply with this part.
            
            
              § 47.2
              Operators and chemicals covered; initial miner training.
              (a) This part applies to any operator producing or using a hazardous chemical to which a miner can be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency. (Subpart J of this part lists exemptions from coverage.)

              (b) Operators of mines which employ six or more miners must instruct each miner with information about the physical and health hazards of chemicals in the miner's work area, the protective measures a miner can take against these hazards, and the contents of the mine's HazCom program by September 23, 2002. Operators of mines that employ five or fewer miners must instruct each miner with information about the physical and health hazards of chemicals in the miner's work area, the protective measures a miner can take against these hazards, and the contents of the mine's HazCom program by March 21, 2003.

              (4) May provide that the exposed miner, the miner's designated representative, or the health professional inform the operator who provided the trade secret chemical identity prior to or at the same time as its disclosure to MSHA; and
              (5) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty bond.
              (b) Nothing in this subpart precludes the parties from pursuing non-contractual remedies to the extent permitted by law.
            
            
              § 47.86
              Denial of a written request for disclosure.
              To deny a written request for disclosure of the identity of a trade secret chemical, the operator must—
              (a) Put the denial in writing,
              (1) Including evidence to substantiate the claim that the chemical's identity is a trade secret,
              (2) Stating the specific reasons why the request is being denied, and
              (3) Explaining how alternative information will satisfy the specific medical or occupational health need without revealing the chemical's identity.
              (b) Provide the denial to the health professional, miner, or designated representative within 30 days of the request.

              Review of denial.
              (a) The health professional, miner, or designated representative may refer the written denial to MSHA for review. The request for review must include a copy of—
              (1) The request for disclosure of the identity of the trade secret chemical,
              (2) The confidentiality agreement, and
              (3) The operator's written denial.
              (b) If MSHA determines that the identity of the trade secret chemical should have been disclosed, the operator will be subject to citation by MSHA.
              (c) If MSHA determines that the confidentiality agreement would not sufficiently protect against unauthorized disclosure of the trade secret, MSHA may impose additional conditions to ensure that the occupational health services are provided without an undue risk of harm to the operator.
              (d) If the operator contests a citation for a failure to release the identity of a trade secret chemical, the matter will be adjudicated by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. The Administrative Law Judge may review the citation and supporting documentation “in camera” or issue appropriate orders to protect the trade secret.

              (b) Each mine rescue team shall consist of five members and one alternate, who are fully qualified, trained, and equipped for providing emergency mine rescue service.

              (c) To be considered for membership on a mine rescue team, each person must have been employed in an underground mine for a minimum of one year within the past five years. For the purpose of mine rescue work only, miners who are employed on the surface but work regularly underground shall meet the experience requirement. The underground experience requirement is waived for those miners on a mine rescue team on the effective date of this rule.
              (d) Each operator shall arrange, in advance, ground transportation for rescue teams and equipment to the mine or mines served.
              (e) Upon the effective date of this part, the required rescue capability shall be present at all existing underground mines, upon initial excavation of a new underground mine entrance, or the re-opening of an existing underground mine.
              (f) Except where alternative compliance is permitted under § 49.3 or § 49.4, no mine served by a mine rescue team shall be located more than two hours ground travel time from the mine rescue station with which the rescue team is associated.
              (g) As used in this part, mine rescue teams shall be considered available where teams are capable presenting themselves at the mine site(s) within a reasonable time after notification of an occurrence which might require their services. Rescue team members will be considered available even though performing regular work duties or in an off-duty capacity. The requirement that mine rescue teams be available shall not apply when teams are participating in mine rescue contests or providing services to another mine.
              (h) Each operator of an underground mine who provides rescue teams under this section shall send the District Manager a statement describing the mine's method of compliance with this part. The statement shall disclose whether the operator has independently provided mine rescue teams or entered into an agreement for the services of mine rescue teams. The name of the provider and the location of the services shall be included in the statement. A copy of the statement shall be posted at the mine for the miners' information. Where a miners' representative has been designated, the operator shall also provide the representative with a copy of the statement.

              (5) The operator's established escape and evacuation plan;
              (6) A statement by the operator evaluating the usefulness of additional refuge chambers to supplement those which may exist;
              (7) A statement by the operator as to the number of miners willing to serve on a mine rescue team;
              (8) The operator's alternative plan for assuring that a suitable mine rescue capability is provided at all times when miners are underground; and
              (9) Other relevant information about the operator's mine which may be requested by the District Manager.
              (d) A copy of the operator's application shall be posted at the mine. Where a miners' representative has been designated, the operator shall also provide the representative with a copy of the application.

              (e) In determining whether to approve an application for alternative compliance, the District Manager shall consider:
              
              (1) The individual circumstances of the small and remote mine;
              (2) Comments submitted by, or on behalf of, any affected miner; and
              (3) Whether the alternative mine rescue plan provides a suitable rescue capability at the operator's mine.
              (f) Where alternative compliance is approved by MSHA, the operator shall adopt the alternative plan and post a copy of the approved plan (with appropriate MSHA mine emergency telephone numbers) at the mine for the miners' information.

              Purpose and scope.

              This part 50 implements sections 103(e) and 111 of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and sections 4 and 13 of the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act, 30 U.S.C. 721 et seq., and applies to operators of coal, metal, and nonmetallic mines. It requires operators to immediately notify the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of accidents, requires operators to investigate accidents, and restricts disturbance of accident related areas. This part also requires operators to file reports pertaining to accidents, occupational injuries and occupational illnesses, as well as employment and coal production data, with MSHA, and requires operators to maintain copies of reports at relevant mine offices. The purpose of this part is to implement MSHA's authority to investigate, and to obtain and utilize information pertaining to, accidents, injuries, and illnesses occurring or originating in mines. In utilizing information received under part 50, MSHA will develop rates of injury occurrence (incident rates or IR), on the basis of 200,000 hours of employee exposure (equivalent to 100 employees working 2,000 hours per year). The incidence rate for a particular injury category will be based on the formula:
              
              IR = (number of cases × 200,000) divided by hours of employee exposure.
              
              MSHA will develop data respecting injury severity using days away from work or days of restricted work activity and the 200,000 hour base as criteria. The severity measure (SM) for a particular injury category will be based on the formula:
              
              SM = (sum of days × 200,000) divided by hours of employee exposure.

              Preparation and submission of MSHA Report Form 7000-1—Mine Accident, Injury, and Illness Report.

              (a) Each operator shall maintain at the mine office a supply of MSHA Mine Accident, Injury, and Illness Report Form 7000-1. These may be obtained from the MSHA District Office. Each operator shall report each accident, occupational injury, or occupational illness at the mine. The principal officer in charge of health and safety at the mine or the supervisor of the mine area in which an accident or occupational injury occurs, or an occupational illness may have originated, shall complete or review the form in accordance with the instructions and criteria in §§ 50.20-1 through 50.20-7. If an occupational illness is diagnosed as being one of those listed in § 50.20-6(b)(7), the operator must report it under this part. The operator shall mail completed forms to MSHA within ten working days after an accident or occupational injury occurs or an occupational illness is diagnosed. When an accident specified in § 50.10 occurs, which does not involve an occupational injury, sections A, B, and items 5 through 12 of section C of Form 7000-1 shall be completed and mailed to MSHA in accordance with the instructions in § 50.20-1 and criteria contained in §§ 50.20-4 through 50.20-6.
              (b) Each operator shall report each occupational injury or occupational illness on one set of forms.

              § 50.20-2
              Criteria—“Transfer to another job.”
              “Transfer to another job” means transfers, either temporary, or permanent, which are occasioned by a work-related injury or illness. Permanent or temporary transfers to remove miners from further exposure to health hazards are considered preventative in nature and are not required to be reported. Controlling the amount of exposure to radiation during some period of time is one example. Transfer of a coal miner to a less dusty area of a mine when the miner elects to exercise rights under Section 203(b) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 is another example.
            
            
              § 50.20-3
              Criteria—Differences between medical treatment and first aid.

              (a) Medical treatment includes, but is not limited to, the suturing of any wound, treatment of fractures, application of a cast or other professional means of immobilizing an injured part of the body, treatment of infection arising out of an injury, treatment of bruise by the drainage of blood, surgical removal of dead or damaged skin (debridement), amputation or permanent loss of use of any part of the body, treatment of second and third degree burns. Procedures which are diagnostic in nature are not considered by themselves to constitute medical treatments. Visits to a physician, physical examinations, X-ray examinations, and hospitalization for observations, where no evidence of injury or illness is found and no medical treatment given, do not in themselves constitute medical treatment. Procedures which are preventive in nature also are not considered by themselves to constitute medical treatment. Tetanus and flu shots are considered preventative in nature. First aid includes any one-time treatment, and follow-up visit for the purpose of observation, of minor injuries such as, cuts, scratches, first degree burns and splinters. Ointments, salves, antiseptics, and dressings to minor injuries are considered to be first aid.
              (1) Abrasion. (i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning a wound, soaking, applying antiseptic and nonprescription medication and bandages on the first visit and follow-up visits limited to observation including changing dressing and bandages. Additional cleaning and application of antiseptic constitutes first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.
              (ii) Medical treatment includes examination for removal of imbedded foreign material, multiple soakings, whirlpool treatment, treatment of infection, or other professional treatments and any treatment involving more than a minor spot-type injury. Treatment of abrasions occurring to greater than full skin depth is considered medical treatment.
              (2) Bruises. (i) First aid treatment is limited to a single soaking or application of cold compresses, and follow-up visits if they are limited only to observation.
              (ii) Medical treatment includes multiple soakings, draining of collected blood, or other treatment beyond observation.
              (3) Burns, Thermal and Chemical (resulting in destruction of tissue by direct contact). (i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning or flushing the surface, soaking, applying cold compresses, antiseptics or nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit, and follow-up visits restricted to observation, changing bandages, or additional cleaning. Most first degree burns are amenable to first aid treatment.
              (ii) Medical treatment includes a series of treatments including soaks, whirlpool, skin grafts, and surgical debridement (cutting away dead skin). Most second and third degree burns require medical treatment.
              (4) Cuts and Lacerations. (i) First aid treatment is the same as for abrasions except the application of butterfly closures for cosmetic purposes only can be considered first aid.
              (ii) Medical treatment includes the application of butterfly closures for non-cosmetic purposes, sutures, (stitches), surgical debridement, treatment of infection, or other professional treatment.
              (5) Eye Injuries. (i) First aid treatment is limited to irrigation, removal of foreign material not imbedded in eye, and application of nonprescription medications. A precautionary visit (special examination) to a physician is considered as first aid if treatment is limited to above items, and follow-up visits if they are limited to observation only.
              (ii) Medical treatment cases involve removal of imbedded foreign objects, use of prescription medications, or other professional treatment.
              (6) Inhalation of Toxic or Corrosive Gases. (i) First aid treatment is limited to removal of the miner to fresh air or the one-time administration of oxygen for several minutes.
              (ii) Medical treatment consists of any professional treatment beyond that mentioned under first aid and all cases involving loss of consciousness.
              (7) Foreign Objects. (i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning the wound, removal of any foreign object by tweezers or other simple techniques, application of antiseptics and nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit. Follow-up visits are limited to observation including changing of bandages. Additional cleaning and applications of antiseptic constitute first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.
              (ii) Medical treatment consists of removal of any foreign object by physician due to depth of imbedment, size or shape of object, or location of wound. Treatment for infection, treatment of a reaction to tetanus booster, or other professional treatment, is considered medical treatment.
              (8) Sprains and Strains. (i) First aid treatment is limited to soaking, application of cold compresses, and use of elastic bandages on the first visit. Follow-up visits for observation, including reapplying bandage, are first aid.
              (ii) Medical treatment includes a series of hot and cold soaks, use of whirlpools, diathermy treatment, or other professional treatment.

              § 50.30-1
              General instructions for completing MSHA Form 7000-2.
              (a) MSHA I.D. Number is the 7-digit number assigned to the mine operation by MSHA. Any questions regarding the appropriate I.D. number to use should be directed to your local MSHA District Office.
              (b) Calendar Quarter: First quarter is January, February, and March. Second quarter is April, May, and June. Third quarter is July, August, and September. Fourth quarter is October, November, and December.
              (c) County is the name of the county, borough, or independent city in which the operation is located.
              (d) Operation Name is the specific name of the mine or plant to which the MSHA I.D. number was assigned and for which the quarterly employment report is being submitted.
              (e) Company Name is the name of the operating company that this report pertains to.
              (f) Mailing Address is the address of the mine office where the quarterly employment report is to be retained. This should be as near the operation as possible.
              (g) Employment, Employee Hours, and Coal Production—(1) Operation Sub-Unit: (i) Underground Mine: Report data for your underground workers on the first line. If you have personnel working at the surface of your underground mine, report data for those persons on the second line;
              (ii) Surface Mine (Including Shops and Yards): Report on the appropriate line, employment and coal production for the mining operation. For surface mining sub-units 03, 04, 05 and 06, include all work associated with shops and yards;

              (iii) Mill Operations, Preparation Plants, Breakers: Report data on all persons employed at your milling (crushing, sizing, grinding, concentrating, etc.) operation, preparation plant, or breaker, including those working in associated shops and yards. (Do not include personnel reported in shops and yards associated with other sub-units.);
              (iv) Office: Include in this category employees who work principally at the mine or preparation facility office.
              (2) Average number of persons working during quarter: Show the average number of employees on the payroll during all active periods in the quarter. Include all classes of employees (supervisory, professional, technical proprietors, owners, operators, partners, and service personnel) on your payroll, full or part-time, Report Each Employee Under One Activity Only. For example: If one or more persons work both in the mine and the mill, report these employees under the activity where they spend most of their time. If necessary, estimate for the major activity. The average number may be computed by adding together the number of employees working during each pay period and then dividing by the number of pay periods. Do not include pay periods where no one worked. For example, during the quarter you had 5 pay periods where employees worked. The number of employees in each pay period was 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively. To compute the average, add the number of employees working each pay period (10 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 64). Then divide by the number of pay periods (64 divided by 5 = 12.8). Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 13 as the average number of persons working.
              (3) Total employee-hours worked during the quarter: Show the total hours worked by all employees during the quarter covered. Include all time where the employee was actually on duty, but exclude vacation, holiday, sick leave, and all other off-duty time, even though paid for. Make certain that each overtime hour is reported as one hour, and not as the overtime pay multiple for an hour of work. The hours reported should be obtained from payroll or other time records. If actual hours are not available, they may be estimated on the basis of scheduled hours. Make certain not to include hours paid but not worked.
              (4) Production of clean coal (short tons): This section is to be compiled only by operators of underground or surface mines, but not by operators of central or independent coal preparation plants or operators of metal or nonmetal mines. Enter the total production of clean coal from the mine. This must include coal shipped from the mine and coal used for fuel at the mine, but exclude refuse and coal produced at another mine and purchased for use at the mine.
              (h) Other Reportable Data. Indicate the number of reportable injuries or illnesses occurring at your operation during the quarter covered by this report. Show the name, title, and telephone number of the person to be contacted regarding this report, and show the date that this report was completed.

                Exposure limits for airborne contaminants.
                Except as permitted by § 56.5005—

                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the exposure to airborne contaminants shall not exceed, on the basis of a time weighted average, the threshold limit values adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, as set forth and explained in the 1973 edition of the Conference's publication, entitled “TLV's Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances in Workroom Air Adopted by ACGIH for 1973,” pages 1 through 54, which are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. This publication may be obtained from the American Conference of Governmental industrial Hygienists by writing to 1330 Kemper Meadow Drive, Attn: Customer Service, Cincinnati, OH 45240; http://www.acgih.org”, or may be examined in any Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health District Office of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Excursions above the listed thresholds shall not be of a greater magnitude than is characterized as permissible by the Conference.
                (b) Asbestos standard—(1) Definitions. Asbestos is a generic term for a number of asbestiform hydrated silicates that, when crushed or processed, separate into flexible fibers made up of fibrils.
                
                  Asbestos means chrysotile, cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos (amosite), crocidolite, anthophylite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite asbestos.
                
                  Asbestos fiber means a fiber of asbestos that meets the criteria of a fiber.
                
                  Fiber means a particle longer than 5 micrometers (µm) with a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 3-to-1.
                
                (2) Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)—(i) Full-shift limit. A miner's personal exposure to asbestos shall not exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average full-shift airborne concentration of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc).
                (ii) Excursion limit. No miner shall be exposed at any time to airborne concentrations of asbestos in excess of 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes.
                (3) Measurement of airborne asbestos fiber concentration. Potential asbestos fiber concentration shall be determined by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) using the OSHA Reference Method in OSHA's asbestos standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1001, Appendix A, or a method at least equivalent to that method in identifying a potential asbestos exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit.

                (3) Service brake tests shall be conducted under the direction of the mine operator in cooperation with an according to the instructions provided by the MSHA inspector as follows:
                (i) Equipment capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour shall be tested with a typical load for that particular piece of equipment. Front-end loaders shall be tested with the loader bucket empty. Equipment shall not be tested when carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives.
                (ii) The approach shall be sufficient length to allow the equipment operator to reach and maintain a constant speed between 10 and 20 miles per hour prior to entering the 100 foot measured area. The constant speed shall be maintained up to the point when the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the brakes. The roadway shall be wide enought to accommodate the size of the equipment being tested. The ground shall be generally level, packed, and dry in the braking portion of the test course. Ground moisture may be present to the extent that it does not adversely affect the braking surface.
                (iii) Braking is to be performed using only those braking systems, including auxiliary retarders, which are designed to bring the equipment to a stop under normal operating conditions. Parking or emergency (secondary) brakes are not to be actuated during the test.
                (iv) The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriate for the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which is designed for the power train to be disengaged during braking.
                (v) Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximum of 20 miles per hour.
                (vi) Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stopped position.
                (4) Test results shall be evaluated as follows:
                (i) If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does not exceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be considered valid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateral motion during the braking portion of the test.
                (ii) If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initial test run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additional test runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment does not exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additional tests.
                (5) Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipment is not capable or traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake tests will not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will rely upon other available evidence to determine whether the service brake system meets the performance requirement of this standard.

                (a) Shaft mines shall be provided with at least one of the following means to control the spread of fire, smoke, and toxic gases underground in the event of a fire: control doors, reversal of mechanical ventilation, or effective evacuation procedures. Under this standard, “shaft mine” means a mine in which any designated escapeway includes a mechanical hoisting device or a ladder ascent.
                (1) Control doors. If used as an alternative, control doors shall be—
                (i) Installed at or near shaft stations of intake shafts and any shaft designated as an escapeway under § 57.11053 or at other locations that provide equivalent protection;
                (ii) Constructed and maintained according to Table C-3;
                (iii) Provided with a means of remote closure at landings of timbered intake shafts unless a person specifically designated to close each door in the event of a fire can reach the door within three minutes;
                (iv) Closed or opened only according to predetermined conditions and procedures;
                (v) Constructed so that once closed they will not reopen as a result of a differential in air pressure;
                (vi) Constructed so that they can be opened from either side by one person, or be provided with a personnel door that can be opened from either side; and
                (vii) Clear of obstructions.
                (2) Mechanical ventilation reversal. If used as an alternative, reversal of mechanical ventilation shall—
                (i) Provide at all times at least the same degree of protection to persons underground as would be afforded by the installation of control doors;
                (ii) Be accomplished by a main fan. If the main fan is located underground—
                (A) The cable or conductors supplying power to the fan shall be routed through areas free of fire hazards; or
                (B) The main fan shall be equipped with a second, independent power cable or set of conductors from the surface. The power cable or conductors shall be located so that an underground fire disrupting power in one cable or set of conductors will not affect the other; or
                (C) A second fan capable of accomplishing ventilation reversal shall be available for use in the event of failure of the main fan;
                (iii) Provide rapid air reversal that allows persons underground time to exit in fresh air by the second escapeway or find a place of refuge; and
                (iv) Be done according to predetermined conditions and procedures.
                (3) Evacuation. If used as an alternative, effective evacuation shall be demonstrated by actual evacuation of all persons underground to the surface in ten minutes or less through routes that will not expose persons to heat, smoke, or toxic fumes in the event of a fire.
                (b) If the destruction of any bulkhead on an inactive level would allow fire contaminants to reach an escapeway, that bulkhead shall be constructed and maintained to provide at least the same protection as required for control doors under Table C-3.

                § 57.4761
                Underground shops.
                To confine or prevent the spread of toxic gases from a fire originating in an underground shop where maintenance work is routinely done on mobile equipment, one of the following measures shall be taken: use of control doors or bulkheads, routing of the mine shop air directly to an exhaust system, reversal of mechanical ventilation, or use of an automatic fire suppression system in conjunction with an alternate escape route. The alternative used shall at all times provide at least the same degree of safety as control doors or bulkheads.
                (a) Control doors or bulkheads. If used as an alternative, control doors or bulkheads shall meet the following requirements:
                (1) Each control door or bulkhead shall be constructed to serve as a barrier to fire, the effects of fire, and air leakage at each opening to the shop.
                (2) Each control door shall be—
                (i) Constructed so that, once closed, it will not reopen as a result of a differential in air pressure;
                (ii) Constructed so that it can be opened from either side by one person or be provided with a personnel door that can be opened from either side;
                (iii) Clear of obstructions; and
                (iv) Provided with a means of remote or automatic closure unless a person specifically designated to close the door in the event of a fire can reach the door within three minutes.
                (3) If located 20 feet or more from exposed timber or other combustible material, the control doors or bulkheads shall provide protection at least equivalent to a door constructed of no less than one-quarter inch of plate steel with channel or angle-iron reinforcement to minimize warpage. The framework assembly of the door and the surrounding bulkhead, if any, shall be at least equivalent to the door in fire and air-leakage resistance, and in physical strength.
                (4) If located less than 20 feet from exposed timber or other combustibles, the control door or bulkhead shall provide protection at least equivalent to a door constructed of two layers of wood, each a minimum of three-quarters of an inch in thickness. The wood-grain of one layer shall be perpendicular to the wood-grain of the other layer. The wood construction shall be covered on all sides and edges with no less than 24-gauge sheet steel. The framework assembly of the door and the surrounding bulkhead, if any, shall be at least equivalent to the door in fire and air-leakage resistance, and in physical strength. Roll-down steel doors with a fire-resistance rating of 11/2 hours or greater, but without an insulation core, are acceptable provided that an automatic sprinkler or deluge system is installed that provides even coverage of the door on both sides.
                (b) Routing air to exhaust system. If used as an alternative, routing the mine shop exhaust air directly to an exhaust system shall be done so that no person would be exposed to toxic gases in the event of a shop fire.
                
                (c) Mechanical ventilation reversal. If used as an alternative, reversal of mechanical ventilation shall—
                (1) Be accomplished by a main fan. If the main fan is located underground:
                (i) The cable or conductors supplying power to the fan shall be routed through areas free of fire hazards; or
                (ii) The main fan shall be equipped with a second, independent power cable or set of conductors from the surface. The power cable or conductors shall be located so that an underground fire disrupting power in one cable or set of conductors will not affect the other; or
                (iii) A second fan capable of accomplishing ventilation reversal shall be available for use in the event of failure of the main fan;
                (2) Provide rapid air reversal that allows persons underground time to exit in fresh air by the second escapeway or find a place of refuge; and
                (3) Be done according to predetermined conditions and procedures.
                (d) Automatic fire suppression system and escape route. If used as an alternative, the automatic fire suppression system and alternate escape route shall meet the following requirements:
                (1) The suppression system shall be—
                (i) Located in the shop area;
                (ii) The appropriate size and type for the particular fire hazards involved; and
                (iii) Inspected at weekly intervals and properly maintained.
                (2) The escape route shall bypass the shop area so that the route will not be affected by a fire in the shop area.

                Exposure limits for airborne contaminants.
                Except as permitted by § 57.5005—

                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), the exposure to airborne contaminants shall not exceed, on the basis of a time weighted average, the threshold limit values adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, as set forth and explained in the 1973 edition of the Conference's publication, entitled “TLV's Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances in Workroom Air Adopted by ACGIH for 1973,” pages 1 through 54, which are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. This publication may be obtained from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists by writing to 1330 Kemper Meadow Drive, Attn: Customer Service, Cincinnati, OH 45240, http://www.acgih.org, or may be examined in any Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health District Office of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Excursions above the listed thresholds shall not be of a greater magnitude than is characterized as permissible by the Conference.
                (b) Asbestos standard—(1) Definitions. Asbestos is a generic term for a number of asbestiform hydrated silicates that, when crushed or processed, separate into flexible fibers made up of fibrils.
                
                  Asbestos means chrysotile, cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos (amosite), crocidolite, anthophylite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite asbestos.
                
                  Asbestos fiber means a fiber of asbestos that meets the criteria of a fiber.
                
                  Fiber means a particle longer than 5 micrometers (µm) with a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 3-to-1.
                (2) Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)—(i) Full-shift limit. A miner's personal exposure to asbestos shall not exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average full-shift airborne concentration of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc).
                (ii) Excursion limit. No miner shall be exposed at any time to airborne concentrations of asbestos in excess of 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes.
                (3) Measurement of airborne asbestos fiber concentration. Potential asbestos fiber concentration shall be determined by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) using the OSHA Reference Method in OSHA's asbestos standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1001, Appendix A, or a method at least equivalent to that method in identifying a potential asbestos exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit. When PCM results indicate a potential exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit, samples shall be further analyzed using transmission electron microscopy according to NIOSH Method 7402 or a method at least equivalent to that method.
                (c) Employees shall be withdrawn from areas where there is present an airborne contaminant given a “C” designation by the Conference and the concentration exceeds the threshold limit value listed for that contaminant.

                § 57.5005
                Control of exposure to airborne contaminants.
                Control of employee exposure to harmful airborne contaminants shall be, insofar as feasible, by prevention of contamination, removal by exhaust ventilation, or by dilution with uncontaminated air. However, where accepted engineering control measures have not been developed or when necessary by the nature of work involved (for example, while establishing controls or occasional entry into hazardous atmospheres to perform maintenance or investigation), employees may work for reasonable periods of time in concentrations of airborne contaminants exceeding permissible levels if they are protected by appropriate respiratory protective equipment. Whenever respiratory protective equipment is used a program for selection, maintenance, training, fitting, supervision, cleaning, and use shall meet the following minimum requirements:
                (a) Respirators approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 which are applicable and suitable for the purpose intended shall be furnished and miners shall use the protective equipment in accordance with training and instruction.

                (b) A respirator program consistent with the requirements of ANSI Z88.2-1969, published by the American National Standards Institute and entitled “American National Standards Practices for Respiratory Protection ANSI Z88.2-1969,” approved August 11, 1969, which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.

The mine operator may request that the required exhaust mine air sampling be done by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. If concentrations of radon daughters in excess of 0.1 WL are found in an exhaust air sample, thereafter—
                (1) Where uranium is mined—radon daughter concentrations representative of worker's breathing zone shall be determined at least every two weeks at random times in all active working areas such as stopes, drift headings, travelways, haulageways, shops, stations, lunch rooms, magazines, and any other place or location where persons work, travel, or congregate. However, if concentrations of radon daughters are found in excess of 0.3 WL in an active working area, radon daughter concentrations thereafter shall be determined weekly in that working area until such time as the weekly determinations in that area have been 0.3 WL or less for 5 consecutive weeks.

                (2) Where uranium is not mined—when radon daughter concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 WL are found in an active working area, radon daughter concentration measurements representative of worker's breathing zone shall be determined at least every 3 months at random times until such time as the radon daughter concentrations in that area are below 0.1 WL, and annually thereafter. If concentrations of radon daughters are found in excess of 0.3 WL in an active working area radon daughter concentrations thereafter shall be determined at least weekly in that working area until such time as the weekly determinations in that area have been 0.3 WL or less for 5 consecutive weeks.
                (b) If concentrations of radon daughters less than 0.1 WL are found in an exhaust mine air sample, thereafter:
                (1) Where uranium is mined—at least one sample shall be taken in the exhaust mine air monthly.
                (2) Where uranium is not mined—no further exhaust mine air sampling is required.
                (c) The sample date, locations, and results obtained under (a) and (b) above shall be recorded and retained at the mine site or nearest mine office for at least two years and shall be made available for inspection by the Secretary or his authorized representative.

                Exposure records.
                (a) The operator shall calculate and record complete individual exposures to concentrations of radon daughters as follows:
                (1) Where uranium is mined—the complete individual exposures of all mine personnel working underground shall be calculated and recorded. These records shall include the individual's time in each active working area such as stopes, drift headings, travelways, haulageways, shops, stations, lunch rooms, magazines and any other place or location where persons work, travel or congregate, and the concentration of airborne radon daughters for each active working area.
                (2) Where uranium is not mined—the complete individual exposure of all mine personnel working in active working areas with radon daughter concentrations in excess of 0.3 WL shall be calculated and recorded. These records shall include the individual's time in each active working area and the concentrations of airborne radon daughters for each active working area. The operator may discontinue calculating and recording the individual exposures of any personnel assigned to work in active working areas where radon daughter concentrations have been reduced to 0.3 WL or less for 5 consecutive weeks provided that such exposure calculation and recordation shall not be discontinued with respect to any person who has accumulated more exposure than 1/12 (one-twelfth) of a WLM times the number of months for which exposures have been calculated and recorded in the calendar year in which the exposure calculation and recordation is proposed to be discontinued.
                (b) The operator shall maintain the form entitled “Record of Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters” (Form 4000-9), or equivalent forms that are acceptable to the Administrator, Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health, Mine Safety and Health Administration, on which there shall be recorded the specific information required by the form with respect to each person's time-weighted current and cumulative exposure to concentrations of radon daughters.
                (1) The form entitled “Record of Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters” (Form 4000-9), shall consist of an original of each form for the operator's records which shall be available for examination by the Secretary or his authorized representative.
                (2) On or before February 15 of each calendar year, or within 45 days after the shutdown of mining operations for the calendar year, each mine operator shall submit to the Mine Safety and Health Administration a copy of the “Record of Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters” (Form 4000-9), or acceptable equivalent form, showing the data required by the form for all personnel for whom calculation and recording of exposure was required during the previous calendar year.

                (3) Errors detected by the operator shall be corrected on any forms kept by the operator and a corrected copy of any forms submitted to the Mine Safety and Health Administration shall be submitted to the Mine Safety and Health Administration within 60 days of detection and shall identify the errors and indicate the date the corrections are made.

                (4) The operator's records of individual exposure to concentrations of radon daughters and copies of “Record of Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters” (Form 4000-9) or acceptable equivalent form or true legible facsimiles thereof (microfilm or other), shall be retained at the mine or nearest mine office for a period as specified in paragraph 9.8, ANSI N13.8-1973, or shall be submitted to the Mine Safety and Health Administration. These records, if retained by the operator, shall be open for inspection by the Secretary of Labor, his authorized representative, and authorized representatives of the official mine inspection agency of the State in which the mine is located. Paragraph 9.8, ANSI N13.8-1973, is incorporated by reference and made a part of this standard. ANSI N13.8-1973 may be examined at any Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health District Office of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and may be obtained from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., at 25 W. 43rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10036; http://www.ansi.org.
                
                (5) Upon written request from a person who is a subject of these records, a statement of the year-to-date and cumulative exposure applicable to that person shall be provided to the person or to whomever such person designates.
                (6) The blank form entitled “Record of Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters” (Form 4000-9) may be obtained on request from any MSHA Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health district office.
                
                  Note:
                  To calculate an individual's exposure to WLM for a given period of time, multiply the total exposure time (hours to the nearest half-hour) in an active working area by the average concentration of airborne radon daughters for the applicable active working area (average working level calculated to the nearest hundredth working level) and divide the product by the constant 173 hours per month.
                  An average airborne radon daughter concentration for a designated active working area shall be determined by averaging all sampling results for that working area during the time that persons are present. Any sample taken by Federal or State mine inspectors, which represents exposure to miners and reported to the operator within three days of being taken, shall be included in the average concentration; except that if the mine operator samples simultaneously with the inspector, he may use his own sample results.

                § 57.5060
                Limit on exposure to diesel particulate matter.

                (a) A miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 308 micrograms of elemental carbon per cubic meter of air (308EC µg/m3). [This interim permissible exposure limit (PEL) remains in effect until the final DPM exposure limit becomes effective. When the final DPM exposure limit becomes effective, MSHA will publish a document in the Federal Register.]

                (b)(1) Effective May 20, 2006, a miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 308 micrograms of elemental carbon per cubic meter of air (308EC µg/m3).

                (2) Effective January 20, 2007, a miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 350 micrograms of total carbon per cubic meter of air (350TC µg/m3).

                (3) Effective May 20, 2008, a miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 160 micrograms of total carbon per cubic meter of air (160TC µg/m3).
                (c)(1) If a mine requires additional time to come into compliance with the final DPM limit established in § 57.5060 (b) due to technological or economic constraints, the operator of the mine may file an application with the District Manager for a special extension.
                (2) The mine operator must certify on the application that the operator has posted one copy of the application at the mine site for at least 30 days prior to the date of application, and has provided another copy to the authorized representative of miners.
                (3) No approval of a special extension shall exceed a period of one year from the date of approval. Mine operators may file for additional special extensions provided each extension does not exceed a period of one year. An application must include the following information:
                (i) Documentation supporting that controls are technologically or economically infeasible at this time to reduce the miner's exposure to the final DPM limit.
                (ii) The most recent DPM monitoring results.
                (iii) The actions the operator will take during the extension to minimize exposure of miners to DPM.

                (4) A mine operator must comply with the terms of any approved application for a special extension, post a copy of the approved application for a special extension at the mine site for the duration of the special extension period, and provide a copy of the approved application to the authorized representative of miners.
                (d) The mine operator must install, use, and maintain feasible engineering and administrative controls to reduce a miner's exposure to or below the applicable DPM PEL established in this section. When controls do not reduce a miner's DPM exposure to the PEL, controls are infeasible, or controls do not produce significant reductions in DPM exposures, controls must be used to reduce the miner's exposure to as low a level as feasible and must be supplemented with respiratory protection in accordance with § 57.5005(a), (b), and paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.
                (1) Air purifying respirators must be equipped with the following:
                (i) Filters certified by NIOSH under 30 CFR part 11 (appearing in the July 1, 1994 edition of 30 CFR, parts 1 to 199) as a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter;
                (ii) Filters certified by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 as 99.97% efficient; or
                (iii) Filters certified by NIOSH for DPM.
                (2) Non-powered, negative-pressure, air purifying, particulate-filter respirators shall use an R- or P-series filter or any filter certified by NIOSH for DPM. An R-series filter shall not be used for longer than one work shift.
                (3) The mine operator must provide a confidential medical evaluation by a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP), at no cost to the miner, to determine the miner's ability to use a respirator before the miner is required to be fit tested or to use a respirator at the mine. If the PLHCP determines that the miner cannot wear a negative pressure respirator, the mine operator must make certain that the PLHCP evaluates the miner's ability to wear a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR).
                (4) The mine operator must provide the miner with an opportunity to discuss their evaluation results with the PLHCP before the PLHCP submits the written determination to the mine operator regarding the miner's ability to wear a respirator. If the miner disagrees with the evaluation results of the PLHCP, the miner may submit within 30 days additional evidence of his or her medical condition to the PLHCP.
                (5) The mine operator must obtain a written determination from the PLHCP regarding the miner's ability to wear a respirator, and the mine operator must assure that the PLHCP provides a copy of the determination to the miner.
                (6) The miner must be reevaluated when the mine operator has reason to believe that conditions have changed which could adversely affect the miner's ability to wear the respirator.
                (7) Upon written notification that the PLHCP has determined that the miner is unable to wear a respirator, including a PAPR, the miner must be transferred to work in an existing position in an area of the same mine where respiratory protection is not required. The miner must be transferred within 30 days of the final determination by the PLHCP.
                (i) The miner must continue to receive compensation at no less than the regular rate of pay in the classification held by that miner immediately prior to the transfer.
                (ii) Increases in wages of the transferred miner must be based upon the new work classification.
                (8) The mine operator must maintain a record of the identity of the PLHCP and the most recent written determination of each miner's ability to wear a respirator for the duration of the miner's employment plus six months.
                (e) Rotation of miners shall not be considered an acceptable administrative control used for compliance with the DPM standard.

                (1) The operator must maintain any approved engine in approved condition;
                (2) The operator must maintain the emission related components of any non-approved engine to manufacturer specifications; and
                (3) The operator must maintain any emission or particulate control device installed on the equipment in effective operating condition.

                (b)(1) A mine operator must authorize each miner operating diesel-powered equipment underground to affix a visible and dated tag to the equipment when the miner notes evidence that the equipment may require maintenance in order to comply with the maintenance standards of paragraph (a) of this section. The term evidence means visible smoke or odor that is unusual for that piece of equipment under normal operating procedures, or obvious or visible defects in the exhaust emissions control system or in the engine affecting emissions.

                (2) A mine operator must ensure that any equipment tagged pursuant to this section is promptly examined by a person authorized to maintain diesel equipment, and that the affixed tag not be removed until the examination has been completed. The term promptly means before the end of the next shift during which a qualified mechanic is scheduled to work.
                (3) A mine operator must retain a log of any equipment tagged pursuant to this section. The log must include the date the equipment is tagged, the date the equipment is examined, the name of the person examining the equipment, and any action taken as a result of the examination. The operator must retain the information in the log for one year after the date the tagged equipment was examined.
                (c) Persons authorized by a mine operator to maintain diesel equipment covered by paragraph (a) of this section must be qualified, by virtue of training or experience, to ensure that the maintenance standards of paragraph (a) of this section are observed. An operator must retain appropriate evidence of the competence of any person to perform specific maintenance tasks in compliance with those standards for one year after the date of any maintenance, and upon request must provide the documentation to the authorized representative of the Secretary.

                (3) Service brake tests shall be conducted under the direction of the mine operator in cooperation with and according to the instructions provided by the MSHA inspector as follows:
                (i) Equipment capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour shall be tested with a typical load for that particular piece of equipment. Front-end loaders shall be tested with the loader bucket empty. Equipment shall not be tested when carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives.
                (ii) The approach shall be of sufficient length to allow the equipment operator to reach and maintain a constant speed between 10 and 20 miles per hour prior to entering the 100 foot measured area. The constant speed shall be maintained up to the point when the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the brakes. The roadway shall be wide enough to accommodate the size of the equipment being tested. The ground shall be generally level, packed, and dry in the braking portion of the test course. Ground moisture may be present to the extent that it does not adversely affect the braking surface.
                (iii) Braking is to be performed using only those braking systems, including auxiliary retarders, which are designed to bring the equipment to a stop under normal operating conditions. Parking or emergency (secondary) brakes are not to be actuated during the test.
                (iv) The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriate for the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which is designed for the power train to be disengaged during braking.

                (v) Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximum of 20 miles per hour.
                
                (vi) Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stopped position.
                (4) Test results shall be evaluated as follows:
                (i) If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does not exceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be considered valid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateral motion during the braking portion of the test.
                (ii) If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initial test run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additional test runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment does not exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additional tests.
                (5) Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipment is not capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake tests will not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will rely upon other available evidence to determine whether the service brake system meets the performance requirements of this standard.

            § 62.100
            Purpose and scope; effective date.
            The purpose of these standards is to prevent the occurrence and reduce the progression of occupational noise-induced hearing loss among miners. This part sets forth mandatory health standards for each surface and underground metal, nonmetal, and coal mine subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The provisions of this part become effective September 13, 2000.
          
          
            § 62.101
            Definitions.
            The following definitions apply in this part:
            
              Access. The right to examine and copy records.
            
              Action level. An 8-hour time-weighted average sound level (TWA8) of 85 dBA, or equivalently a dose of 50%, integrating all sound levels from 80 dBA to at least 130 dBA.
            
              Audiologist. A professional, specializing in the study and rehabilitation of hearing, who is certified by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) or licensed by a state board of examiners.
            
              Baseline audiogram. The audiogram recorded in accordance with § 62.170(a) of this part against which subsequent audiograms are compared to determine the extent of hearing loss.
            
              Criterion level. The sound level which if constantly applied for 8 hours results in a dose of 100% of that permitted by the standard.
            
              Decibel (dB). A unit of measure of sound pressure levels, defined in one of two ways, depending upon the use:
            (1) For measuring sound pressure levels, the decibel is 20 times the common logarithm of the ratio of the measured sound pressure to the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals (µPa), which is the threshold of normal hearing sensitivity at 1000 Hertz (Hz).
            (2) For measuring hearing threshold levels, the decibel is the difference between audiometric zero (reference pressure equal to 0 hearing threshold level) and the threshold of hearing of the individual being tested at each test frequency.
            
              Dual Hearing Protection Level. A TWA8 of 105 dBA, or equivalently, a dose of 800% of that permitted by the standard, integrating all sound levels from 90 dBA to at least 140 dBA.
            
              Exchange rate. The amount of increase in sound level, in decibels, which would require halving of the allowable exposure time to maintain the same noise dose. For the purposes of this part, the exchange rate is 5 decibels (5 dB).
            
              Hearing protector. Any device or material, capable of being worn on the head or in the ear canal, sold wholly or in part on the basis of its ability to reduce the level of sound entering the ear, and which has a scientifically accepted indicator of noise reduction value.
            
              Hertz (Hz). Unit of measurement of frequency numerically equal to cycles per second.
            
              Medical pathology. A condition or disease affecting the ear.
            
              Miner's designee. Any individual or organization to whom a miner gives written authorization to exercise a right of access to records.
            
              Qualified technician. A technician who has been certified by the Council for Accreditation in Occupational Hearing Conservation (CAOHC), or by another recognized organization offering equivalent certification.
            
              Permissible exposure level. A TWA8 of 90 dBA or equivalently a dose of 100% of that permitted by the standard, integrating all sound levels from 90 dBA to at least 140 dBA.
            
              Reportable hearing loss. A change in hearing sensitivity for the worse, relative to the miner's baseline audiogram, or the miner's revised baseline audiogram where one has been established in accordance with § 62.170(c)(2), of an average of 25 dB or more at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz in either ear.
            
              Revised baseline audiogram. An annual audiogram designated to be used in lieu of a miner's original baseline audiogram in measuring changes in hearing sensitivity as a result of the circumstances set forth in §§ 62.170(c)(1) or 62.170(c)(2) of this part.
            
              Sound level. The sound pressure level in decibels measured using the A-weighting network and a slow response, expressed in the unit dBA.
            
              Standard threshold shift. A change in hearing sensitivity for the worse relative to the miner's baseline audiogram, or relative to the most recent revised baseline audiogram where one has been established, of an average of 10 dB or more at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz in either ear.
            
              Time-weighted average-8 hour (TWA8). The sound level which, if constant over 8 hours, would result in the same noise dose as is measured.
          
          
            § 62.110
            Noise exposure assessment.
            (a) The mine operator must establish a system of monitoring that evaluates each miner's noise exposure sufficiently to determine continuing compliance with this part.

            (b) The mine operator must determine a miner's noise dose (D, in percent) by using a noise dosimeter or by computing the formula: D = 100(C1/T1 + C2/T2 + . . . . + Cn/Tn), where Cn is the total time the miner is exposed at a specified sound level, and Tn is the reference duration of exposure at that sound level shown in Table 62-1.

            (1) The mine operator must use Table 62-2 when converting from dose readings to equivalent TWA8 readings.
            (2) A miner's noise dose determination must:
            (i) Be made without adjustment for the use of any hearing protector;
            (ii) Integrate all sound levels over the appropriate range;
            (iii) Reflect the miner's full work shift;
            (iv) Use a 90-dB criterion level and a 5-dB exchange rate; and
            (v) Use the A-weighting and slow response instrument settings.
            (c) Observation of monitoring. The mine operator must provide affected miners and their representatives with an opportunity to observe noise exposure monitoring required by this section and must give prior notice of the date and time of intended exposure monitoring to affected miners and their representatives.
            (d) Miner notification. The mine operator must notify a miner of his or her exposure when the miner's exposure is determined to equal or exceed the action level, exceed the permissible exposure level, or exceed the dual hearing protection level, provided the mine operator has not notified the miner of an exposure at such level within the prior 12 months. The mine operator must base the notification on an exposure evaluation conducted either by the mine operator or by an authorized representative of the Secretary of Labor. The mine operator must notify the miner in writing within 15 calendar days of:
            (1) The exposure determination; and (2) the corrective action being taken.
            (e) The mine operator must maintain a copy of any such miner notification, or a list on which the relevant information about that miner's notice is recorded, for the duration of the affected miner's exposure at or above the action level and for at least 6 months thereafter.
          
          
            § 62.120
            Action level.

            If during any work shift a miner's noise exposure equals or exceeds the action level the mine operator must enroll the miner in a hearing conservation program that complies with § 62.150 of this part.
          
          
            § 62.130
            Permissible exposure level.
            (a) The mine operator must assure that no miner is exposed during any work shift to noise that exceeds the permissible exposure level. If during any work shift a miner's noise exposure exceeds the permissible exposure level, the mine operator must use all feasible engineering and administrative controls to reduce the miner's noise exposure to the permissible exposure level, and enroll the miner in a hearing conservation program that complies with § 62.150 of this part. When a mine operator uses administrative controls to reduce a miner's exposure, the mine operator must post the procedures for such controls on the mine bulletin board and provide a copy to the affected miner.
            (b) If a miner's noise exposure continues to exceed the permissible exposure level despite the use of all feasible engineering and administrative controls, the mine operator must continue to use the engineering and administrative controls to reduce the miner's noise exposure to as low a level as is feasible.
            (c) The mine operator must assure that no miner is exposed at any time to sound levels exceeding 115 dBA, as determined without adjustment for the use of any hearing protector.
          
          
            § 62.140
            Dual hearing protection level.
            If during any work shift a miner's noise exposure exceeds the dual hearing protection level, the mine operator must, in addition to the actions required for noise exposures that exceed the permissible exposure level, provide and ensure the concurrent use of both an ear plug and an ear muff type hearing protector. The following table sets out mine operator actions under MSHA's noise standard.

            § 62.160
            Hearing protectors.
            (a) A mine operator must provide a hearing protector to a miner whose noise exposure equals or exceeds the action level under § 62.120 of this part. In addition, the mine operator must:
            (1) Train the miner in accordance with § 62.180 of this part;
            (2) Allow the miner to choose a hearing protector from at least two muff types and two plug types, and in the event dual hearing protectors are required, to choose one of each type;
            (3) Ensure that the hearing protector is in good condition and is fitted and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions;

            (4) Provide the hearing protector and necessary replacements at no cost to the miner; and
            
            (5) Allow the miner to choose a different hearing protector(s), if wearing the selected hearing protector(s) is subsequently precluded due to medical pathology of the ear.
            (b) The mine operator must ensure, after satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, that a miner wears a hearing protector whenever the miner's noise exposure exceeds the permissible exposure level before the implementation of engineering and administrative controls, or if the miner's noise exposure continues to exceed the permissible exposure level despite the use of all feasible engineering and administrative controls.
            (c) The mine operator must ensure, after satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, that a miner wears a hearing protector when the miner's noise exposure is at or above the action level, if:
            (1) The miner has incurred a standard threshold shift; or
            (2) More than 6 months will pass before the miner can take a baseline audiogram.

            The mine operator must provide audiometric tests to satisfy the requirements of this part at no cost to the miner. A physician or an audiologist, or a qualified technician under the direction or supervision of a physician or an audiologist must conduct the tests.
            (a) Baseline audiogram. The mine operator must offer miners the opportunity for audiometric testing of the miner's hearing sensitivity for the purpose of establishing a valid baseline audiogram to compare with subsequent annual audiograms. The mine operator may use an existing audiogram of the miner's hearing sensitivity as the baseline audiogram if it meets the audiometric testing requirements of § 62.171 of this part.
            (1) The mine operator must offer and provide within 6 months of enrolling the miner in a hearing conservation program, audiometric testing which results in a valid baseline audiogram, or offer and provide the testing within 12 months where the operator uses mobile test vans to do the testing.
            (2) The mine operator must notify the miner to avoid high levels of noise for at least 14 hours immediately preceding the baseline audiogram. The mine operator must not expose the miner to workplace noise for the 14-hour quiet period before conducting the audiometric testing to determine a baseline audiogram. The operator may substitute the use of hearing protectors for this quiet period.
            (3) The mine operator must not establish a new baseline audiogram or a new revised baseline audiogram, where one has been established, due to changes in enrollment status in the hearing conservation program. The mine operator may establish a new baseline or revised baseline audiogram for a miner who is away from the mine for more than 6 consecutive months.
            (b) Annual audiogram. After the baseline audiogram is established, the mine operator must continue to offer subsequent audiometric tests at intervals not exceeding 12 months for as long as the miner remains in the hearing conservation program.
            (c) Revised baseline audiogram. An annual audiogram must be deemed to be a revised baseline audiogram when, in the judgment of the physician or audiologist:
            (1) A standard threshold shift revealed by the audiogram is permanent; or (2) The hearing threshold shown in the annual audiogram indicates significant improvement over the baseline audiogram.
          
          
            § 62.171
            Audiometric test procedures.
            (a) All audiometric testing under this part must be conducted in accordance with scientifically validated procedures. Audiometric tests must be pure tone, air conduction, hearing threshold examinations, with test frequencies including 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz. Each ear must be tested separately.
            (b) The mine operator must compile an audiometric test record for each miner tested. The record must include:
            (1) Name and job classification of the miner tested;

            (2) A copy of all of the miner's audiograms conducted under this part;
            
            (3) Evidence that the audiograms were conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;
            (4) Any exposure determination for the miner conducted in accordance with § 62.110 of this part; and
            (5) The results of follow-up examination(s), if any.
            (c) The operator must maintain audiometric test records for the duration of the affected miner's employment, plus at least 6 months, and make the records available for inspection by an authorized representative of the Secretary of Labor.
          
          
            § 62.172
            Evaluation of audiograms.
            (a) The mine operator must:
            (1) Inform persons evaluating audiograms of the requirements of this part and provide those persons with a copy of the miner's audiometric test records;
            (2) Have a physician or an audiologist, or a qualified technician who is under the direction or supervision of a physician or audiologist:
            (i) Determine if the audiogram is valid; and
            (ii) Determine if a standard threshold shift or a reportable hearing loss, as defined in this part, has occurred.
            (3) Instruct the physician, audiologist, or qualified technician not to reveal to the mine operator, without the written consent of the miner, any specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to the miner's hearing loss due to occupational noise or the wearing of hearing protectors; and
            (4) Obtain the results and the interpretation of the results of audiograms conducted under this part within 30 calendar days of conducting the audiogram.
            (b)(1) The mine operator must provide an audiometric retest within 30 calendar days of receiving a determination that an audiogram is invalid, provided any medical pathology has improved to the point that a valid audiogram may be obtained.
            (2) If an annual audiogram demonstrates that the miner has incurred a standard threshold shift or reportable hearing loss, the mine operator may provide one retest within 30 calendar days of receiving the results of the audiogram and may use the results of the retest as the annual audiogram.
            (c) In determining whether a standard threshold shift or reportable hearing loss has occurred, allowance may be made for the contribution of aging (presbycusis) to the change in hearing level. The baseline, or the revised baseline as appropriate, and the annual audiograms used in making the determination should be adjusted according to the following procedure:
            (1) Determine from Tables 62-3 or 62-4 the age correction values for the miner by:
            (i) Finding the age at which the baseline audiogram or revised baseline audiogram, as appropriate, was taken, and recording the corresponding values of age corrections at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz;
            (ii) Finding the age at which the most recent annual audiogram was obtained and recording the corresponding values of age corrections at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz; and
            (iii) Subtracting the values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section from the values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The differences calculated represent that portion of the change in hearing that may be due to aging.
            (2) Subtract the values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section from the hearing threshold levels found in the annual audiogram to obtain the adjusted annual audiogram hearing threshold levels.
            (3) Subtract the hearing threshold levels in the baseline audiogram or revised baseline audiogram from the adjusted annual audiogram hearing threshold levels determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the age-corrected threshold shifts.
          
          
            § 62.173
            Follow-up evaluation when an audiogram is invalid.

            (a) If a valid audiogram cannot be obtained due to a suspected medical pathology of the ear that the physician or audiologist believes was caused or aggravated by the miner's occupational exposure to noise or the wearing of hearing protectors, the mine operator must refer the miner for a clinical-audiological evaluation or an otological examination, as appropriate, at no cost to the miner.
            (b) If a valid audiogram cannot be obtained due to a suspected medical pathology of the ear that the physician or audiologist concludes is unrelated to the miner's occupational exposure to noise or the wearing of hearing protectors, the mine operator must instruct the physician or audiologist to inform the miner of the need for an otological examination.
            (c) The mine operator must instruct the physician, audiologist, or qualified technician not to reveal to the mine operator, without the written consent of the miner, any specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to the miner's occupational exposure to noise or the wearing of hearing protectors.
          
          
            § 62.174
            Follow-up corrective measures when a standard threshold shift is detected.
            The mine operator must, within 30 calendar days of receiving evidence or confirmation of a standard threshold shift, unless a physician or audiologist determines the standard threshold shift is neither work-related nor aggravated by occupational noise exposure:
            (a) Retrain the miner, including the instruction required by § 62.180 of this part;
            (b) Provide the miner with the opportunity to select a hearing protector, or a different hearing protector if the miner has previously selected a hearing protector, from among those offered by the mine operator in accordance with § 62.160 of this part; and
            (c) Review the effectiveness of any engineering and administrative controls to identify and correct any deficiencies.
          
          
            § 62.175
            Notification of results; reporting requirements.
            (a) The mine operator must, within 10 working days of receiving the results of an audiogram, or receiving the results of a follow-up evaluation required under § 62.173 of this part, notify the miner in writing of:
            (1) The results and interpretation of the audiometric test, including any finding of a standard threshold shift or reportable hearing loss; and
            (2) The need and reasons for any further testing or evaluation, if applicable.
            (b) When evaluation of the audiogram shows that a miner has incurred a reportable hearing loss as defined in this part, the mine operator must report such loss to MSHA as a noise-induced hearing loss in accordance with part 50 of this title, unless a physician or audiologist has determined that the loss is neither work-related nor aggravated by occupational noise exposure.
          
          
            § 62.180
            Training.
            (a) The mine operator must, within 30 days of a miner's enrollment into a hearing conservation program, provide the miner with training. The mine operator must give training every 12 months thereafter if the miner's noise exposure continues to equal or exceed the action level. Training must include:
            (1) The effects of noise on hearing;
            (2) The purpose and value of wearing hearing protectors;
            (3) The advantages and disadvantages of the hearing protectors to be offered;
            (4) The various types of hearing protectors offered by the mine operator and the care, fitting, and use of each type;
            (5) The general requirements of this part;
            (6) The mine operator's and miner's respective tasks in maintaining mine noise controls; and
            (7) The purpose and value of audiometric testing and a summary of the procedures.
            (b) The mine operator must certify the date and type of training given each miner, and maintain the miner's most recent certification for as long as the miner is enrolled in the hearing conservation program and for at least 6 months thereafter.
          
          
            § 62.190
            Records.

            (a) The authorized representatives of the Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services must have access to all records required under this part. Upon written request, the mine operator must provide, within 15 calendar days of the request, access to records to:
            
            (1) The miner, or with the miner's written consent, the miner's designee, for all records that the mine operator must maintain for that individual miner under this part;
            (2) Any representative of miners designated under part 40 of this title, to training certifications compiled under § 62.180(b) of this part and to any notice of exposure determination under § 62.110(d) of this part, for the miners whom he or she represents; and
            (3) Any former miner, for records which indicate his or her own exposure.
            (b) When a person with access to records under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section requests a copy of a record, the mine operator must provide the first copy of such record at no cost to that person, and any additional copies requested by that person at reasonable cost.
            (c) Transfer of records. (1) The mine operator must transfer all records required to be maintained by this part, or a copy thereof, to a successor mine operator who must maintain the records for the time period required by this part.
            (2) The successor mine operator must use the baseline audiogram, or revised baseline audiogram, as appropriate, obtained by the original mine operator to determine the existence of a standard threshold shift or reportable hearing loss.

              § 70.100
              Respirable dust standards.
              (a) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed, as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration, at or below:
              (1) 2.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air (mg/m3).
              (2) 1.5 mg/m3 as of August 1, 2016.
              (b) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust within 200 feet outby the working faces of each section in the intake airways as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration at or below:
              (1) 1.0 mg/m3.
              (2) 0.5 mg/m3 as of August 1, 2016.
            
            
              § 70.101
              Respirable dust standard when quartz is present.
              (a) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable quartz dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed at or below 0.1 mg/m3 (100 micrograms per cubic meter or µg/m3) as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration.

              (b) When the equivalent concentration of respirable quartz dust exceeds 100 µg/m3, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings is exposed as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration at or below the applicable dust standard. The applicable dust standard is computed by dividing the percent of quartz into the number 10. The application of this formula shall not result in an applicable dust standard that exceeds the standard established by § 70.100(a).
              
              
                Example:
                Assume the sampled MMU or DA is on a 1.5-mg/m3 dust standard. Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent concentration of 1.12 mg/m3 contains 12.3% of quartz dust, which corresponds to a quartz concentration of 138 µg/m3. Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that MMU or DA shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.8 mg/m3 (10/12.3% = 0.8 mg/m3).

              § 70.201
              Sampling; general and technical requirements.
              (a) Only an approved coal mine dust personal sampler unit (CMDPSU) shall be used to take bimonthly samples of the concentration of respirable coal mine dust from the designated occupation (DO) in each MMU as required by this part until Janaury 31, 2016. On February 1, 2016, DOs in each MMU shall be sampled quarterly with an approved CPDM as required by this part and an approved CMDPSU shall not be used, unless notified by the Secretary to continue to use an approved CMDPSU to conduct quarterly sampling.
              (b) Only an approved CMDPSU shall be used to take bimonthly samples of the concentration of respirable coal mine dust from each designated area (DA) as required by this part until January 31, 2016. On February 1, 2016:
              (1) DAs associated with an MMU shall be redesignated as Other Designated Occupations (ODO). ODOs shall be sampled quarterly with an approved CPDM as required by this part and an approved CMDPSU shall not be used, unless notified by the Secretary to continue to use an approved CMDPSU to conduct quarterly sampling.

              (2) DAs identified by the operator under § 75.371(t) of this chapter shall be sampled quarterly with an approved CMDPSU as required by this part, unless the operator notifies the District Manager in writing that only an approved CPDM will be used for all DA sampling at the mine. The notification must be received at least 90 days before the beginning of the quarter in which CPDMs will be used to collect the DA samples.
              (c) Sampling devices shall be worn or carried directly to the MMU or DA to be sampled and from the MMU or DA sampled and shall be operated portal-to-portal. Sampling devices shall remain with the occupation or DA being sampled and shall be operational during the entire shift, which includes the total time spent in the MMU or DA and while traveling to and from the mining section or area being sampled. If the work shift to be sampled is longer than 12 hours and the sampling device is:
              (1) A CMDPSU, the operator shall switch-out the unit's sampling pump prior to the 13th-hour of operation.
              (2) A CPDM, the operator shall switch-out the CPDM with a fully charged device prior to the 13th-hour of operation.
              (d) If using a CMDPSU, one control filter shall be used for each shift of sampling. Each control filter shall:
              (1) Have the same pre-weight date (noted on the dust data card) as the filters used for sampling;
              (2) Remain plugged at all times;
              (3) Be used for the same amount of time, and exposed to the same temperature and handling conditions as the filters used for sampling;
              (4) Be kept with the exposed samples after sampling and in the same mailing container when transmitted to MSHA.
              (e) Records showing the length of each production shift for each MMU shall be made and retained for at least six months and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners, and submitted to the District Manager when requested in writing.
              (f) Upon request from the District Manager, the operator shall submit the date and time any respirable dust sampling required by this part will begin. This information shall be submitted at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled sampling.

              § 71.100
              Respirable dust standard.
              Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed, as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration, at or below:
              (a) 2.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air (mg/m3).
              (b) 1.5 mg/m3 as of August 1, 2016.
            
            
              § 71.101
              Respirable dust standard when quartz is present.
              (a) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable quartz dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed at or below 0.1 mg/m3 (100 micrograms per cubic meter or µg/m3) as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration.

              (b) When the equivalent concentration of respirable quartz dust exceeds 100 µg/m3, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings is exposed as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration at or below the applicable standard. The applicable standard is computed by dividing the percent of quartz into the number 10. The application of this formula shall not result in the applicable standard that exceeds the standard established by § 71.100(a) of this section.
              Example: Assume the sampled DWP is on a 1.5-mg/m3 dust standard. Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent concentration of 1.09 mg/m3 contains 16.7% of quartz dust, which corresponds to a quartz concentration of 182 µg/m3. Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that DWP shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.6 mg/m3 (10/16.7% = 0.6 mg/m3).

              Sampling; general and technical requirements.
              (a) Each operator shall take representative samples of the concentration of respirable dust in the active workings of the mine as required by this part only with an approved CMDPSU. On February 1, 2016, the operator may use an approved CPDM if the operator notifies the District Manager in writing that only an approved CPDM will be used for all DWP sampling at the mine. The notification must be received at least 90 days before the beginning of the quarter in which CPDMs will be used to collect the DWP samples.
              (b) Sampling devices shall be worn or carried directly to and from the DWP to be sampled. Sampling devices shall remain with the DWP and shall be operational during the entire shift, which includes the total time spent in the DWP and while traveling to and from the DWP being sampled. If the work shift to be sampled is longer than 12 hours and the sampling device is:
              (1) A CMDPSU, the operator shall switch-out the unit's sampling pump prior to the 13th-hour of operation.
              (2) A CPDM, the operator shall switch-out the CPDM with a fully charged device prior to the 13th-hour of operation.
              (c) If using a CMDPSU, one control filter shall be used for each shift of sampling. Each control filter shall:

              (c) If using a CPDM, the person certified in sampling shall monitor the dust concentrations and the sampling status conditions being reported by the sampling device at mid-shift or more frequently as specified in the approved respirable dust control plan, if applicable, to assure: The sampling device is in the proper location and operating properly; and the work environment of the occupation being sampled remains in compliance with the applicable standard at the end of the shift.
            
            
              § 71.206
              Quarterly sampling; designated work positions.
              (a) Each operator shall take one valid representative sample from the DWP during each quarterly period. The quarterly periods are:
              January 1-March 31
              April 1-June 30
              July 1-September 30
              October 1-December 31.
              (b) When the respirable dust standard is changed in accordance with § 71.101, the new applicable standard shall become effective 7 calendar days after the date of the notification of the change by MSHA.
              (c) Designated work position samples shall be collected at locations to measure respirable dust generation sources in the active workings. The specific work positions at each mine where DWP samples shall be collected include:
              (1) Each highwall drill operator (MSHA occupation code 384);
              (2) Bulldozer operators (MSHA occupation code 368); and
              (3) Other work positions designated by the District Manager for sampling in accordance with § 71.206(m).
              (d) Operators with multiple work positions specified in paragraph (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section shall sample the DWP exposed to the greatest respirable dust concentration in each work position performing the same activity or task at the same location at the mine and exposed to the same dust generation source. Each operator shall provide the District Manager with a list identifying the specific work positions where DWP samples will be collected for:
              (1) Active mines—by October 1, 2014.
              (2) New mines—Within 30 calendar days of mine opening.

              (e) Each DWP sample shall be taken on a normal work shift. If a normal work shift is not achieved, the respirable dust sample shall be transmitted to MSHA with a notation by the person certified in sampling on the back of the dust data card stating that the sample was not taken on a normal work shift. When a normal work shift is not achieved, the sample for that shift may be voided by MSHA. However, any sample, regardless of whether a normal work shift was achieved, that exceeds the applicable standard by at least 0.1 mg/m3 shall be used in the determination of the equivalent concentration for that occupation.
              (f) Unless otherwise directed by the District Manager, DWP samples shall be taken by placing the sampling device as follows:
              (1) Equipment operator: On the equipment operator or on the equipment within 36 inches of the operator's normal working position.
              (2) Non-equipment operators: On the miner assigned to the DWP or at a location that represents the maximum concentration of dust to which the miner is exposed.
              (g) Upon notification from MSHA that any valid representative sample taken from a DWP to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the applicable standard, the operator shall, within 15 calendar days of notification, sample that DWP each normal work shift until five valid representative samples are taken. The operator shall begin sampling on the first normal work shift following receipt of notification.
              (h) When a valid representative sample taken in accordance with this section meets or exceeds the excessive concentration value (ECV) in Table 71-1 that corresponds to the applicable standard and particular sampling device used, the operator shall:
              (1) Make approved respiratory equipment available to affected miners in accordance with § 72.700 of this chapter;
              (2) Immediately take corrective action to lower the concentration of respirable coal mine dust to at or below the applicable standard; and

              (3) Make a record of the corrective actions taken. The record shall be certified by the mine foreman or equivalent mine official, no later than the end of the mine foreman's or equivalent official's next regularly scheduled working shift. The record shall be made in a secure book that is not susceptible to alteration or electronically in a computer system so as to be secure and not susceptible to alteration. Such records shall be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least 1 year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.
              (i) Noncompliance with the applicable standard is demonstrated during the sampling period when:
              (1) Two or more valid representative samples meet or exceed the ECV in Table 71-1 that corresponds to the applicable standard and the particular sampling device used; or
              (2) The average for all valid representative samples meets or exceeds the ECV in Table 71-2 that corresponds to the applicable standard and the particular sampling device used.
              (j) Unless otherwise directed by the District Manager, upon issuance of a citation for a violation of the applicable standard, paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to that DWP until the violation is abated and the citation is terminated in accordance with paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section.
              (k) Upon issuance of a citation for violation of the applicable standard, the operator shall take the following actions sequentially:
              (1) Make approved respiratory equipment available to affected miners in accordance with § 72.700 of this chapter;
              (2) Immediately take corrective action to lower the concentration of respirable coal mine dust to at or below the applicable standard; and
              (3) Make a record of the corrective actions taken. The record shall be certified by the mine foreman or equivalent mine official, no later than the end of the mine foreman's or equivalent official's next regularly scheduled working shift. The record shall be made in a secure book that is not susceptible to alteration or electronically in a computer system so as to be secure and not susceptible to alteration. Such records shall be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least 1 year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.
              (4) Begin sampling, within 8 calendar days after the date the citation is issued, the environment of the affected DWP on consecutive normal work shifts until five valid representative samples are taken.
              (l) A citation for violation of the applicable standard shall be terminated by MSHA when the equivalent concentration of each of the five valid representative samples is at or below the applicable standard.

              § 71.702
              Asbestos standard.
              (a) Definitions. Asbestos is a generic term for a number of asbestiform hydrated silicates that, when crushed or processed, separate into flexible fibers made up of fibrils.
              
                Asbestos means chrysotile, cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos (amosite), crocidolite, anthophylite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite asbestos.
              
                Asbestos fiber means a fiber of asbestos that meets the criteria of a fiber.
              
                Fiber means a particle longer than 5 micrometers (µm) with a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 3-to-1.
              (b) Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)—(1) Full-shift limit. A miner's personal exposure to asbestos shall not exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average full-shift airborne concentration of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc).
              (2) Excursion limit. No miner shall be exposed at any time to airborne concentrations of asbestos in excess of 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes.
              (c) Measurement of airborne asbestos fiber concentration. Potential asbestos fiber concentration shall be determined by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) using the OSHA Reference Method in OSHA's asbestos standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1001, Appendix A, or a method at least equivalent to that method in identifying a potential asbestos exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit. When PCM results indicate a potential exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit, samples shall be further analyzed using transmission electron microscopy according to NIOSH Method 7402 or a method at least equivalent to that method.

              (a) MSHA will determine compliance with the emission requirements established by this part by using the amount of diesel particulate matter emitted by a particular engine determined from the engine approval pursuant to § 7.89(a)(9)(iii)(B) or § 7.89(a)(9)(iv)(A) of this title, with the exception of engines deemed to be in compliance by meeting the EPA requirements specified in Table 72.502-1 (§ 72.502(b)).
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the amount by which an aftertreatment device can reduce engine emissions of diesel particulate matter as determined pursuant to paragraph (a) must be established by a laboratory test:
              (1) on an approved engine which MSHA has determined, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to emit no more diesel particulate matter than the engine being used in the piece of diesel-powered equipment in question;
              (2) using the test cycle specified in Table E-3 of § 7.89 of this title, and following a test procedure appropriate for the filtration system, by a laboratory capable of testing engines in accordance with the requirements of Subpart E of part 7 of this title; and
              (3) with an aftertreatment device representative of that being used on the piece of diesel-powered equipment in question.
              (c) In lieu of the laboratory tests required by paragraph (b), the Secretary may accept the results of tests conducted or certified by an organization whose testing standards are deemed by the Secretary to be as rigorous as those set forth by paragraph (b) of this section; and further, the Secretary may accept the results of tests for one aftertreatment device as evidencing the efficiency of another aftertreatment device which the Secretary determines to be essentially identical to the one tested.
              (d) Operators must maintain in accordance with manufacturer specifications and free of observable defects, any aftertreatment device installed on a piece of diesel equipment upon which the operator relies to remove diesel particulate matter from diesel emissions.
              (e) For purposes of §§ 72.500(a), 72.501(a) and 72.502(a), the term “introduced” means any piece of equipment whose engine is a new addition to the underground inventory of engines of the mine in question, including newly purchased equipment, used equipment, and equipment receiving a replacement engine that has a different serial number than the engine it is replacing. “Introduced” does not include a piece of equipment whose engine was previously part of the mine inventory and rebuilt.

              § 74.1
              Purpose.
              The regulations in this part set forth the requirements for approval of coal mine dust sampling devices for determining the concentrations of respirable dust in coal mine atmospheres; procedures for applying for such approval; test procedures; and labeling.
            
            
              § 74.2
              Definitions.
              (a) Accuracy: the ability of a continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM) to determine the “true” concentration of the environment sampled. Accuracy describes the closeness of a typical measurement to the quantity measured, although it is defined and expressed in terms of the relative discrepancy of a typical measurement from the quantity measured. The accuracy of a CPDM is the theoretical maximum error of measurement, expressed as the proportion or percentage of the amount being measured, without regard for the direction of the error, which is achieved with a 0.95 probability by the method.
              (b) Bias: the uncorrectable relative discrepancy between the mean of the distribution of measurements from a CPDM and the true concentration being measured.
              (c) Coal mine dust personal sampler unit (CMDPSU): a personal device for measuring concentrations of respirable dust in coal mine atmospheres that meets the requirements specified under Subpart B of this part.
              (d) Continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM): a sampling device for continuously measuring concentrations of respirable dust in coal mine atmospheres that reports within-shift and end-of shift measurements of dust concentrations immediately upon the completion of the period of exposure that was monitored and that meets the requirements specified under Subpart C of this part.
              (e) ISO: the International Organization for Standardization, an international standard-setting organization composed of representatives from various national standards-setting organizations. ISO produces industrial and commercial voluntary consensus standards used worldwide.
              (f) Precision: the relative variability of measurements from a homogeneous atmosphere about the mean of the population of measurements, divided by the mean at a given concentration. It reflects the ability of a CPDM to replicate measurement results.

              (h) Reporting of monitoring results. (1) The CPDM shall report continuous monitoring results legibly or audibly during use. A digital display, if used, shall be illuminated and shall provide a minimum character height of 6 millimeters. Other forms of display (e.g., analogue) must provide comparable visibility. Auditory reporting, if used, shall be clear, have adjustable volume, and provide means for the user to obtain data reports repetitively. The CPDM shall also report end-of-shift results using computer software compatible with current, commonly used personal computer technology.
              (2) The CPDM shall report results as cumulative mass concentration in units of mass per volume of air (mg/m3) with two significant figures of accuracy rounded as customary.
              (i) Power requirements. The power source of the CPDM shall have sufficient capacity to enable continuous sampling for 12 hours in a coal mine dust atmosphere of up to 4.0 mg/m3. If the CPDM uses a rechargeable battery, the battery charger shall be operated from a 110 (VAC) (nominal), 60 Hz power line.
              (j) Flow stability and calibration of pump.

              [75 FR 17523, Apr. 6, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 52990, Sept. 2, 2015]
            
            
              § 74.8
              Measurement, accuracy, and reliability requirements.
              (a) Breathing zone measurement requirement. The CPDM shall be capable of measuring respirable dust within the personal breathing zone of the miner whose exposure is being monitored.
              (b) Accuracy. The ability of a CPDM to determine the true concentration of respirable coal mine dust at the end of a shift shall be established through testing that demonstrates the following:

              (1) For full-shift measurements of 8 hours or more, a 95 percent confidence that the recorded measurements are within ±25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over a concentration range from 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m3; and
              (2) For intra-shift measurements of less than 8 hours, a 95 percent confidence that the recorded measurements are within ±25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over the concentration range equivalent to 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m3 for an 8-hour period.1
                
              
              
                

                  1 The equivalent dust concentration range to the 8-hour range of 0.2 − 4 mg/m3 is calculated by multiplying this 8-hour range by the dividend of eight hours divided by the duration of the intrashift measurement specified in units of hours. For example, for a measurement taken at exactly one hour into the shift, the 8-hour equivalent dust concentration range would be a one-hour average concentration range of: 8 hours/1 hour × (0.2 − 4 mg/m3) = 1.6 − 32 mg/m3; for a two-hour measurement, the applicable concentration range would be calculated as: 8 hours/2 hours × (0.2 − 4 mg/m3) = 0.8 − 16 mg/m3; for a 4-hours measurement, the equivalent range would be: 0.4 − 8 mg/m3; * * * etc. A CPDM must perform accurately, as specified, for intrashift measurements within such equivalent concentration ranges.
              
              (c) Reliability of measurements. The CPDM shall meet the accuracy requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of the variation in density, composition, size distribution of respirable coal mine dust particles, and the presence of water spray mist in coal mines.
              (d) Precision. The precision of the CPDM shall be established through testing to determine the variability of multiple measurements of the same dust concentration, as defined by the relative standard deviation of the distribution of measurements. The relative standard deviation shall be less than 0.1275 without bias for both full-shift measurements of 8 hours or more, and for intra-shift measurements of less than 8 hours within the dust concentration range equivalent to 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m3 for an 8-hour period, as specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (e) Bias. The bias of the CPDM measurements shall be limited such that the uncorrectable discrepancy between the mean of the distribution of measurements and the true dust concentration being measured during testing shall be no greater than 10 percent. Bias must be constant over the range of dust concentration levels tested, 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m3 for an 8-hour sampling period.
              (f) Testing conditions. Laboratory and mine testing of the CPDM for accuracy, precision, bias, and reliability under diverse environmental conditions (as defined under § 74.7(e) and (g)) shall be determined using the NIOSH testing procedure, “Continuous Personal Dust Monitor Accuracy Testing,” June 23, 2008, available at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/pubs/pubreference/outputid3076.htm. All testing results shall be submitted to NIOSH in writing on the application filed under § 74.11.

              (a) If the applicant desires to change any feature of a certified CMDPSU or a certified CPDM, the applicant shall first obtain the approval of NIOSH pursuant to the following procedures:
              (1) Application shall be made as for an original certificate of approval, requesting that the existing certification be extended to encompass the proposed change. The application shall be accompanied by drawings, specifications, and related material.
              (2) The application and accompanying material will be examined by NIOSH to determine whether testing of the modified CMDPSU or CPDM or components will be required. Testing will be necessary if there is a possibility that the modification may adversely affect the performance of the CMDPSU or CPDM. NIOSH will inform the applicant whether such testing is required.

              (3) If the proposed modification meets the pertinent requirements of these regulations, a formal extension of certification will be issued, accompanied by a list of new and revised drawings and specifications to be added to those already on file as the basis for the extension of certification.
              
              (b) If a change is proposed in a pump unit of a certified CMDPSU or in electrical components of a CPDM, the approval of MSHA with respect to intrinsic safety shall be obtained in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 74.11(d).

              § 75.204
              Roof bolting.
              (a) For roof bolts and accessories addressed in ASTM F432-95, “Standard Specification for Roof and Rock Bolts and Accessories,” the mine operator shall—
              (1) Obtain a manufacturer's certification that the material was manufactured and tested in accordance with the specifications of ASTM F432-95; and
              (2) Make this certification available to an authorized representative of the Secretary and to the representative of miners.
              (b) Roof bolts and accessories not addressed in ASTM F432-95 may be used, provided that the use of such materials is approved by the District Manager based on—
              (1) Demonstrations which show that the materials have successfully supported the roof in an area of a coal mine with similar strata, opening dimensions and roof stresses; or
              (2) Tests which show the materials to be effective for supporting the roof in an area of the affected mine which has similar strata, opening dimensions and roof stresses as the area where the roof bolts are to be used. During the test process, access to the test area shall be limited to persons necessary to conduct the test.
              (c)(1) A bearing plate shall be firmly installed with each roof bolt.
              (2) Bearing plates used directly against the mine roof shall be at least 6 inches square or the equivalent, except that where the mine roof is firm and not susceptible to sloughing, bearing plates 5 inches square or the equivalent may be used.
              (3) Bearing plates used with wood or metal materials shall be at least 4 inches square or the equivalent.
              (4) Wooden materials that are used between a bearing plate and the mine roof in areas which will exist for three years or more shall be treated to minimize deterioration.
              (d) When washers are used with roof bolts, the washers shall conform to the shape of the roof bolt head and bearing plate.

              (e)(1) The diameter of finishing bits shall be within a tolerance of plus or minus 0.030 inch of the manufacturer's recommended hole diameter for the anchor used.
              
              (2) When separate finishing bits are used, they shall be distinguishable from other bits.
              (f) Tensioned roof bolts. (1) Roof bolts that provide support by creating a beam of laminated strata shall be at least 30 inches long. Roof bolts that provide support by suspending the roof from overlying stronger strata shall be long enough to anchor at least 12 inches into the stronger strata.
              (2) Test holes, spaced at intervals specified in the roof control plan, shall be drilled to a depth of at least 12 inches above the anchorage horizon of mechanically anchored tensioned bolts being used. When a test hole indicates that bolts would not anchor in competent strata, corrective action shall be taken.
              (3) The installed torque or tension ranges for roof bolts as specified in the roof control plan shall maintain the integrity of the support system and shall not exceed the yield point of the roof bolt nor anchorage capacity of the strata.
              (4) In each roof bolting cycle, the actual torque or tension of the first tensioned roof bolt installed with each drill head shall be measured immediately after it is installed. Thereafter, for each drill head used, at least one roof bolt out of every four installed shall be measured for actual torque or tension. If the torque or tension of any of the roof bolts measured is not within the range specified in the roof control plan, corrective action shall be taken.
              (5) In working places from which coal is produced during any portion of a 24-hour period, the actual torque or tension on at least one out of every ten previously installed mechanically anchored tensioned roof bolts shall be measured from the outby corner of the last open crosscut to the face in each advancing section. Corrective action shall be taken if the majority of the bolts measured—
              (i) Do not maintain at least 70 percent of the minimum torque or tension specified in the roof control plan, 50 percent if the roof bolt plates bear against wood; or
              (ii) Have exceeded the maximum specified torque or tension by 50 percent.
              (6) The mine operator or a person designated by the operator shall certify by signature and date that measurements required by paragraph (f)(5) of this section have been made. This certification shall be maintained for at least one year and shall be made available to an authorized representative of the Secretary and representatives of the miners.
              (7) Tensioned roof bolts installed in the roof support pattern shall not be used to anchor trailing cables or used for any other purpose that could affect the tension of the bolt. Hanging trailing cables, line brattice, telephone lines, or other similar devices which do not place sudden loads on the bolts are permitted.
              (8) Angle compensating devices shall be used to compensate for the angle when tensioned roof bolts are installed at angles greater than 5 degrees from the perpendicular to the bearing plate.
              (g) Non-tensioned grouted roof bolts. The first non-tensioned grouted roof bolt installed during each roof bolting cycle shall be tested during or immediately after the first row of bolts has been installed. If the bolt tested does not withstand at least 150 foot-pounds of torque without rotating in the hole, corrective action shall be taken.

              § 75.336
              Sampling and monitoring requirements.
              (a) A certified person as defined in § 75.100 shall monitor atmospheres of sealed areas. Sealed areas shall be monitored, whether ingassing or outgassing, for methane and oxygen concentrations and the direction of leakage.
              (1) Each sampling pipe and approved sampling location shall be sampled at least every 24 hours.
              (i) Atmospheres with seals of 120 psi or greater shall be sampled until the design strength is reached for every seal used to seal the area.
              (ii) Atmospheres with seals less than 120 psi constructed before October 20, 2008 shall be monitored for methane and oxygen concentrations and maintained inert. The operator may request that the District Manager approve different sampling locations and frequencies in the ventilation plan, provided at least one sample is taken at each set of seals at least every 7 days.
              (iii) Atmospheres with seals less than 120 psi constructed after October 20, 2008 shall be monitored for methane and oxygen concentrations and maintained inert. The operator may request that the District Manager approve different sampling locations and frequencies in the ventilation plan after a minimum of 14 days and after the seal design strength is reached, provided at least one sample is taken at each set of seals at least every 7 days.
              (2) The mine operator shall evaluate the atmosphere in the sealed area to determine whether sampling through the sampling pipes in seals and approved locations provides appropriate sampling locations of the sealed area. The mine operator shall make the evaluation immediately after the minimum 14-day required sampling, if the mine ventilation system is reconfigured, if changes occur that adversely affect the sealed area, or if the District Manager requests an evaluation. When the results of the evaluations indicate the need for additional sampling locations, the mine operator shall provide the additional locations and have them approved in the ventilation plan. The District Manager may require additional sampling locations and frequencies in the ventilation plan.

              (3) Mine operators with an approved ventilation plan addressing spontaneous combustion pursuant to § 75.334(f) shall sample the sealed atmosphere in accordance with the ventilation plan.
              (4) The District Manager may approve in the ventilation plan the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of monitoring provisions in this section.
              (b)(1) Except as provided in § 75.336(d), the atmosphere in the sealed area is considered inert when the oxygen concentration is less than 10.0 percent or the methane concentration is less than 3.0 percent or greater than 20.0 percent.
              (2) Immediate action shall be taken by the mine operator to restore an inert sealed atmosphere behind seals with strengths less than 120 psi. Until the atmosphere in the sealed area is restored to an inert condition, the sealed atmosphere shall be monitored at each sampling pipe and approved location at least once every 24 hours.
              (c) Except as provided in § 75.336(d), when a sample is taken from the sealed atmosphere with seals of less than 120 psi and the sample indicates that the oxygen concentration is 10 percent or greater and methane is between 4.5 percent and 17 percent, the mine operator shall immediately take an additional sample and then immediately notify the District Manager. When the additional sample indicates that the oxygen concentration is 10 percent or greater and methane is between 4.5 percent and 17 percent, persons shall be withdrawn from the affected area which is the entire mine or other affected area identified by the operator and approved by the District Manager in the ventilation plan, except those persons referred to in § 104(c) of the Act. The operator may identify areas in the ventilation plan to be approved by the District Manager where persons may be exempted from withdrawal. The operator's request shall address the location of seals in relation to: Areas where persons work and travel in the mine; escapeways and potential for damage to the escapeways; and ventilation systems and controls in areas where persons work or travel and where ventilation is used for escapeways. The operator's request shall also address the gas concentration of other sampling locations in the sealed area and other required information. Before miners reenter the mine, the mine operator shall have a ventilation plan revision approved by the District Manager specifying the actions to be taken.
              (d) In sealed areas with a demonstrated history of carbon dioxide or sealed areas where inert gases have been injected, the operator may request that the District Manager approve in the ventilation plan an alternative method to determine if the sealed atmosphere is inert and when miners have to be withdrawn. The mine operator shall address in the ventilation plan the specific levels of methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen; the sampling methods and equipment used; and the methods to evaluate these concentrations underground at the seal.
              (e) Recordkeeping. (1) The certified person shall promptly record each sampling result including the location of the sampling points, whether ingassing or outgassing, and oxygen and methane concentrations. The results of oxygen and methane samples shall be recorded as the percentage of oxygen and methane measured by the certified person and any hazardous condition found in accordance with § 75.363.
              (2) The mine operator shall retain sampling records at the mine for at least one year from the date of the sampling.

The locations for measuring these air quantities must be approved in the mine ventilation plan.
              
              (7) The air velocity in the belt entry must be at least 100 feet per minute. When requested by the mine operator, the district manager may approve lower velocities in the ventilation plan based on specific mine conditions.
              (8) The air velocity in the belt entry must not exceed 1,000 feet per minute. When requested by the mine operator, the district manager may approve higher velocities in the ventilation plan based on specific mine conditions.
              (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 75.380(g), additional intake air may be added to the belt air course through a point-feed regulator. The location and use of point feeds must be approved in the mine ventilation plan.
              (d) If the air through the point-feed regulator enters a belt air course which is used to ventilate a working section or an area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, the following conditions must be met:
              (1) The air current that will pass through the point-feed regulator must be monitored for carbon monoxide or smoke at a point within 50 feet upwind of the point-feed regulator. A second point must be monitored 1,000 feet upwind of the point-feed regulator unless the mine operator requests that a lesser distance be approved by the district manager in the mine ventilation plan based on mine specific conditions;
              (2) The air in the belt air course must be monitored for carbon monoxide or smoke upwind of the point-feed regulator. This sensor must be in the belt air course within 50 feet of the mixing point where air flowing through the point-feed regulator mixes with the belt air;
              (3) The point-feed regulator must be provided with a means to close the regulator from the intake air course without requiring a person to enter the crosscut where the point-feed regulator is located. The point-feed regulator must also be provided with a means to close the regulator from a location in the belt air course immediately upwind of the crosscut containing the point-feed regulator;
              (4) A minimum air velocity of 300 feet per minute must be maintained through the point-feed regulator;
              (5) The location(s) and use of a point-feed regulator(s) must be approved in the mine ventilation plan and shown on the mine ventilation map; and
              (6) An AMS must be installed, operated, examined, and maintained as specified in § 75.351.

              (1) Appropriate personnel must notify miners in affected working sections, in affected areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, and at other locations specified in the § 75.1502 approved mine emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction; and
              (2) All personnel in the affected areas, unless assigned other duties under § 75.1502, must be withdrawn promptly to a safe location identified in the mine emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction.
              (d) If there is an alert or alarm signal from a methane sensor installed in accordance with §§ 75.323(d)(1)(ii) and 75.362(f), an investigation must be initiated to determine the cause of the signal, and the actions required under § 75.323 must be taken.
              (e) If any fire detection components of the AMS malfunction or are inoperative, immediate action must be taken to return the system to proper operation. While the AMS component repairs are being made, operation of the belt may continue if the following conditions are met:
              (1) If one AMS sensor malfunctions or becomes inoperative, a trained person must continuously monitor for carbon monoxide or smoke at the inoperative sensor.
              (2) If two or more adjacent AMS sensors malfunction or become inoperative, a trained person(s) must patrol and continuously monitor for carbon monoxide or smoke so that the affected areas will be traveled each hour in their entirety, or a trained person must be stationed to monitor at each inoperative sensor.
              (3) If the complete AMS malfunctions or becomes inoperative, trained persons must patrol and continuously monitor for carbon monoxide or smoke so that the affected areas will be traveled each hour in their entirety.
              (4) The trained person(s) monitoring under this section must, at a minimum, have two-way voice communication capabilities with the AMS operator at intervals not to exceed 2,000 feet and report contaminant levels to the AMS operator at intervals not to exceed 60 minutes.
              (5) The trained person(s) monitoring under this section must report immediately to the AMS operator any concentration of the contaminant that reaches either the alert or alarm level specified in § 75.351(i), or the alternate alert and alarm levels specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, unless the source of the contaminant is known not to present a hazard.
              (6) Detectors used to monitor under this section must have a level of detectability equal to that required of the sensors in § 75.351(l).
              (7) For those AMSs using sensors other than carbon monoxide sensors, an alternate detector and the alert and alarm levels associated with that detector must be specified in the approved mine ventilation plan.
              (f) If the minimum air velocity is not maintained when required under § 75.350(b)(7), immediate action must be taken to return the ventilation system to proper operation. While the ventilation system is being corrected, operation of the belt may continue only while a trained person(s) patrols and continuously monitors for carbon monoxide or smoke as set forth in §§ 75.352(e)(3) through (7), so that the affected areas will be traveled each hour in their entirety.
              (g) The AMS shall automatically provide both a visual and audible signal in the belt entry at the point-feed regulator location, at affected sections, and at the designated surface location when carbon monoxide concentrations reach:
              (1) The alert level at both point-feed intake monitoring sensors; or
              (2) The alarm level at either point-feed intake monitoring sensor.

              § 75.373
              Reopening mines.
              After a mine is abandoned or declared inactive, and before it is reopened, mining operations shall not begin until MSHA has been notified and has completed an inspection.
            
            
              § 75.380
              Escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines.
              (a) Except in situations addressed in § 75.381, § 75.385 and § 75.386, at least two separate and distinct travelable passageways shall be designated as escapeways and shall meet the requirements of this section.
              (b) (1) Escapeways shall be provided from each working section, and each area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, continuous to the surface escape drift opening or continuous to the escape shaft or slope facilities to the surface.
              (2) During equipment installation, these escapeways shall begin at the projected location for the section loading point. During equipment removal, they shall begin at the location of the last loading point.

              (c) The two separate and distinct escapeways required by this section shall not end at a common shaft, slope, or drift opening, except that multiple compartment shafts or slopes separated by walls constructed of noncombustible material may be used as separate and distinct passageways.
              
              (d) Each escapeway shall be—
              (1) Maintained in a safe condition to always assure passage of anyone, including disabled persons;
              (2) Clearly marked to show the route and direction of travel to the surface;
              (3) Maintained to at least a height of 5 feet from the mine floor to the mine roof, excluding the thickness of any roof support, except that the escapeways shall be maintained to at least the height of the coalbed, excluding the thickness of any roof support, where the coalbed is less than 5 feet. In areas of mines where escapeways pass through doors, the height may be less than 5 feet, provided that sufficient height is maintained to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. In areas of mines developed before November 16, 1992, where escapeways pass over or under overcasts or undercasts, the height may be less than 5 feet provided that sufficient height is maintained to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. When there is a need to determine whether sufficient height is provided, MSHA may require a stretcher test where 4 persons carry a miner through the area in question on a stretcher;
              (4) Maintained at least 6 feet wide except—
              (i) Where necessary supplemental roof support is installed, the escapeway shall not be less than 4 feet wide; or
              (ii) Where the route of travel passes through doors or other permanent ventilation controls, the escapeway shall be at least 4 feet wide to enable miners to escape quickly in an emergency, or
              (iii) Where the alternate escapeway passes through doors or other permanent ventilation controls or where supplemental roof support is required and sufficient width is maintained to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. When there is a need to determine whether sufficient width is provided, MSHA may require a stretcher test where 4 persons carry a miner through the area in question on a stretcher, or
              (iv) Where mobile equipment near working sections, and other equipment essential to the ongoing operation of longwall sections, is necessary during normal mining operations, such as material cars containing rock dust or roof control supplies, or is to be used for the evacuation of miners off the section in the event of an emergency. In any instance, escapeways shall be of sufficient width to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. When there is a need to determine whether sufficient width is provided, MSHA may require a stretcher test where 4 persons carry a miner through the area in question on a stretcher;
              (5) Located to follow the most direct, safe and practical route to the nearest mine opening suitable for the safe evacuation of miners; and
              (6) Provided with ladders, stairways, ramps, or similar facilities where the escapeways cross over obstructions.
              (7) Provided with a continuous, durable directional lifeline or equivalent device that shall be—
              (i) Installed and maintained throughout the entire length of each escapeway as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

                (iii) Look-ahead circuits must detect a ground-fault condition and prevent the circuit-interrupting device from closing as long as the ground-fault condition exists.
                (iv) Backup ground-fault devices must cause de-energization of the circuit extending to the continuous mining machine at not more than 40 percent of the voltage developed across the neutral grounding resistor when a ground fault occurs with the neutral grounding resistor open. The time-delay setting of the backup device must not exceed 0.25 seconds.
                (v) Thermal devices must detect a sustained ground-fault current in the neutral grounding resistor and must de-energize the incoming power. The device must operate at either 50 percent of the maximum temperature rise of the neutral grounding resistor or 302 °F (150 °C), whichever is less. Thermal protection must not be dependent on control power and may consist of a current transformer and over-current relay in the neutral grounding resistor circuit.
                (vi) A single window-type current transformer that encircles all three-phase conductors must be used to activate the ground-fault device protecting the continuous mining machine. Equipment grounding conductors must not pass through the current transformer.

              (a) Low- and medium-voltage three-phase alternating-current circuits used underground shall contain either a direct or derived neutral which shall be grounded through a suitable resistor at the power center, and a grounding circuit, originating at the grounded side of the grounding resistor, shall extend along with the power conductors and serve as a grounding conductor for the frames of all the electrical equipment supplied power from that circuit, except that the Secretary or his authorized representative may permit ungrounded low- and medium-voltage circuits to be used underground to feed such stationary electrical equipment if such circuits are either steel armored or installed in grounded rigid steel conduit throughout their entire length. The grounding resistor, where required, shall be of the proper ohmic value to limit the ground fault current to 25 amperes. The grounding resistor shall be rated for maximum fault current continuously and insulated from ground for a voltage equal to the phase-to-phase voltage of the system.
              (b) Diesel-powered electrical generators used as an alternative to power centers for the purpose of moving equipment in, out, and around the mine, and to perform work in areas where permissible equipment is not required, must comply with the following:
              (1) The diesel engine powering the electrical generator must be approved under 30 CFR part 7, subpart E.
              (2) A grounding resistor rated for the phase-to-phase voltage of the system must be provided to limit the ground-fault current to not more than 0.5 amperes. The grounding resistor(s) must be located:
              (i) Between the wye-connected generator neutral and the generator frame; (see Figure I in Appendix A to subpart J of this part) or
              (ii) Between the wye-connected generator neutral and the generator frame and between the wye-connected transformer secondary and the transformer frame when an isolation transformer(s) is used and the generator is supplying power to the other equipment; (see Figure II in Appendix A to subpart J of this part) or
              (iii) Between the wye-connected generator neutral and the generator frame when an auto-transformer is used. (see Figure III in Appendix A to subpart J of this part)
              (3) Each three-phase output circuit of the generator must be equipped with a sensitive ground fault relay. The protective relay must be set to cause the circuit interrupting device that supplies power to the primary windings of each transformer to trip and shut down the diesel engine when a phase-to-frame fault of not more than 90 milliamperes occurs.
              (4) Each three-phase output circuit that supplies power to equipment must be equipped with an instantaneous sensitive ground-fault relay that will cause its respective circuit interrupting device(s) to trip and cause shutdown of the diesel engine when a phase-to-frame fault occurs. The grounded-phase protection must be set at not more than 90 milliamps. Current transformers used for the ground-fault protection must be single window-type and must be installed to encircle all three phase conductors. Equipment safety grounding conductors must not pass through or be connected in series with ground-fault current transformers.

              (6) The equipment portable cable length(s) must not exceed the length(s) specified in 30 CFR part 18, appendix I, table 9, Specifications for Cables Longer than 500 Feet.
              (7) Permanent label(s) listing the maximum circuit interrupting device setting(s) and maximum portable cable length(s) must be installed on each instantaneous trip unit or be maintained near each three-phase circuit interrupting device. The permanent label(s) must be maintained legibly.
              (8) The circuit interrupting device that supplies three-phase power circuit(s) to the equipment being powered must be limited to the use of only one circuit interrupting device at a time when equipment is being moved in, out, and around the mine.

              (9) The grounding system must include an MSHA-accepted ground wire monitor system that satisfies the requirements of § 75.902; or have a No. 1/0 or larger external grounding conductor to bond and ground the frames of all equipment to the frame of the generator.
              (10) All trailing cables extending from the generator to equipment must comply with § 75.907.
              (11) A strain relief device must be provided on each end of the trailing cables that extends between the generator and the piece of equipment being powered.
              (12) Prior to moving each piece of equipment or performing work, a functional test of each ground fault and ground wire monitor system must be performed by a qualified electrician who meets the requirements of § 75.153. The ground-fault circuit must be tested without subjecting the circuit to an actual grounded phase condition. A record of each test must be maintained and made available to authorized representatives of the Secretary and to the miners in such mine.

              Automatic fire sensor and warning device systems; installation; minimum requirements.
              (a) Effective December 31, 2009, automatic fire sensor and warning device systems that use carbon monoxide sensors shall provide identification of fire along all belt conveyors.
              (1) Carbon monoxide sensors shall be installed at the following locations:
              (i) Not more than 100 feet downwind of each belt drive unit, each tailpiece transfer point, and each belt take-up. If the belt drive, tailpiece, and/or take-up for a single transfer point are installed together in the same air course, and the distance between the units is less than 100 feet, they may be monitored with one sensor downwind of the last component. If the distance between the units exceeds 100 feet, additional sensors are required downwind of each belt drive unit, each tailpiece transfer point, and each belt take-up;
              (ii) Not more than 100 feet downwind of each section loading point;
              (iii) Along the belt entry so that the spacing between sensors does not exceed 1,000 feet. Where air velocities are less than 50 feet per minute, spacing must not exceed 350 feet; and
              (iv) The mine operator shall indicate the locations of all carbon monoxide sensors on the mine maps required by §§ 75.1200 and 75.1505 of this part.
              (2) Where used, sensors responding to radiation, smoke, gases, or other indications of fire, shall be spaced at regular intervals to provide protection equivalent to carbon monoxide sensors, and installed within the time specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              (3) When the distance from the tailpiece at loading points to the first outby sensor reaches the spacing requirements in § 75.1103-4(a)(1)(iii), an additional sensor shall be installed and put in operation within 24 production shift hours. When sensors of the kind described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are used, they shall be installed and put in operation within 24 production shift hours after the equivalent distance which has been established for the sensor from the tailpiece at loading points to the first outby sensor is first reached.

              (b) Automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall be installed so as to minimize the possibility of damage from roof falls and the moving belt and its load. Sensors must be installed near the center in the upper third of the entry, in a manner that does not expose personnel working on the system to unsafe conditions. Sensors must not be located in abnormally high areas or in other locations where air flow patterns do not permit products of combustion to be carried to the sensors.
              (c) Infrared, ultraviolet, and other sensors whose effectiveness is impaired by contamination shall be protected from dust, dirt, and moisture.
              (d) The voltage of automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall not exceed 120 volts.
              (e) Except when power must be cut off in the mine under the provisions of § 75.313, automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall be capable of giving warning of fire for a minimum of 4 hours after the source of power to the belt is removed unless the belt haulageway is examined for hot rollers and fire as provided in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section.
              (1) When an unplanned removal of power from the belt occurs an examination for hot rollers and fire in the operating belts of a conveyor system shall be completed within 2 hours after the belt has stopped.
              (2) When a preplanned removal of power from the belt occurs an examination for hot rollers and fire on the operating belts of a conveyor system may commence not more than 30 minutes before the belts are stopped and shall be completed within 2 hours after the examination is commenced, or the examination shall be commenced when the belts are stopped and completed within 2 hours after the belts are stopped.

              Automatic fire warning devices; actions and response.
              (a) When the carbon monoxide level reaches 10 parts per million above the established ambient level at any sensor location, automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall provide an effective warning signal at the following locations:
              (1) At working sections and other work locations where miners may be endangered from a fire in the belt entry.
              (2) At a manned surface location where personnel have an assigned post of duty. The manned surface location must have:
              (i) A telephone or equivalent communication with all miners who may be endangered and
              (ii) A map or schematic that shows the locations of sensors, and the intended air flow direction at these locations. This map or schematic must be updated within 24 hours of any change in this information.
              (3) The automatic fire sensor and warning device system shall be monitored for a period of 4 hours after the belt is stopped, unless an examination for hot rollers and fire is made as prescribed in § 75.1103-4(e).
              (b) The fire sensor and warning device system shall include a means for rapid evaluation of electrical short and open circuits, ground faults, pneumatic leaks, or other defect detrimental to its proper operational condition.
              (c) Automatic fire sensor and warning devices shall include a manual reset feature.
              (d) When a malfunction or warning signal is received at the manned surface location, the sensors that are activated must be identified and appropriate personnel immediately notified.
              (e) Upon notification of a malfunction or warning signal, appropriate personnel must immediately initiate an investigation to determine the cause of the malfunction or warning signal and take the required actions set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (f) If any sensor indicates a warning, the following actions must be taken unless the mine operator determines that the signal does not present a hazard to miners:

              (1) Appropriate personnel must notify miners in affected working sections, in affected areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, and at other locations specified in the approved mine emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction; and
              
              (2) All miners in the affected areas, unless assigned emergency response duties, must be immediately withdrawn to a safe location identified in the mine emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction.
              (g) If the warning signal will be activated during calibration of sensors, personnel manning the surface location must be notified prior to and upon completion of calibration. Affected working sections, areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, or other areas designated in the approved emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction must be notified at the beginning and completion of calibration.
              (h) If any fire detection component becomes inoperative, immediate action must be taken to repair the component. While repairs are being made, operation of the belt may continue if the following requirements are met:
              (1) If one sensor becomes inoperative, a trained person must continuously monitor for carbon monoxide at the inoperative sensor;
              (2) If two or more adjacent sensors become inoperative, trained persons must patrol and continuously monitor the affected areas for carbon monoxide so that they will be traveled each hour in their entirety. Alternatively, a trained person must be stationed at each inoperative sensor to monitor for carbon monoxide;
              (3) If the complete fire detection system becomes inoperative, trained persons must patrol and continuously monitor the affected areas for carbon monoxide so that they will be traveled each hour in their entirety;
              (4) Trained persons who conduct monitoring under this section must have two-way voice communication capability, at intervals not to exceed 2,000 feet, and must report carbon monoxide concentrations to the surface at intervals not to exceed one hour;
              (5) Trained persons who conduct monitoring under this section must immediately report to the surface any concentration of carbon monoxide that reaches 10 parts per million above the established ambient level, unless the mine operator knows that the source of the carbon monoxide does not present a hazard to miners; and
              (6) Handheld detectors used to monitor the belt entry under this section must have a detection level equivalent to that of the system's carbon monoxide sensors.

These machines must meet the requirements in this section when placed in service with a proximity detection system.
              (b) Requirements for a proximity detection system. A proximity detection system includes machine-mounted components and miner-wearable components. The system must:
              (1) Cause a machine, which is tramming from place-to-place or repositioning, to stop before contacting a miner except for a miner who is in the on-board operator's compartment;
              (2) Provide an audible and visual warning signal on the miner-wearable component and a visual warning signal on the machine that alert miners before the system causes a machine to stop. These warning signals must be distinguishable from other signals;
              (3) Provide a visual signal on the machine that indicates the machine-mounted components are functioning properly;
              (4) Prevent movement of the machine if any machine-mounted component of the system is not functioning properly. However, a system with any machine-mounted component that is not functioning properly may allow machine movement if it provides an audible or visual warning signal, distinguishable from other signals, during movement. Such movement is permitted only for purposes of relocating the machine from an unsafe location for repair;
              (5) Be installed to prevent interference that adversely affects performance of any electrical system; and
              (6) Be installed and maintained in proper operating condition by a person trained in the installation and maintenance of the system.
              (c) Proximity detection system checks. Operators must:
              (1) Designate a person who must perform a check of machine-mounted components of the proximity detection system to verify that components are intact, that the system is functioning properly, and take action to correct defects—
              (i) At the beginning of each shift when the machine is to be used; or
              (ii) Immediately prior to the time the machine is to be operated if not in use at the beginning of a shift; or
              (iii) Within 1 hour of a shift change if the shift change occurs without an interruption in production.

              (2) Check for proper operation of miner-wearable components at the beginning of each shift that the components are to be used and correct defects before the components are used.
              
              (d) Certifications and records. The operator must make and retain certifications and records as follows:
              (1) At the completion of the check of machine-mounted components required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a certified person under § 75.100 must certify by initials, date, and time that the check was conducted. Defects found as a result of the check, including corrective actions and dates of corrective actions, must be recorded before the end of the shift;
              (2) Make a record of the defects found as a result of the check of miner-wearable components required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, including corrective actions and dates of corrective actions;
              (3) Make a record of the persons trained in the installation and maintenance of proximity detection systems required under paragraph (b)(6) of this section;
              (4) Maintain records in a secure book or electronically in a secure computer system not susceptible to alteration; and
              (5) Retain records for at least one year and make them available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and representatives of miners.

              § 90.100
              Respirable dust standard.

              After the 20th calendar day following receipt of notification from MSHA that a part 90 miner is employed at the mine, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which the part 90 miner in the active workings of the mine is exposed, as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration, at or below:
              
              (a) 1.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air (mg/m3).
              (b) 0.5 mg/m3 as of August 1, 2016.
            
            
              § 90.101
              Respirable dust standard when quartz is present.
              (a) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable quartz dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which a part 90 miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed at or below 0.1 mg/m3 (100 micrograms per cubic meter or µg/m3) as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration.
              (b) When the mine atmosphere of the active workings where the part 90 miner performs his or her normal work duties exceeds 100 µg/m3 of respirable quartz dust, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which a part 90 miner is exposed as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration at or below the applicable standard. The applicable standard is computed by dividing the percent of quartz into the number 10. The application of this formula shall not result in an applicable standard that exceeds the standards specified in § 90.100.
              Example: Assume the part 90 miner is on a 0.5 mg/m3 dust standard. Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent concentration of 0.50 mg/m3 contains 25.6% of quartz dust, which corresponds to a quartz concentration of 128 µg/m3. Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that part 90 miner shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.4 mg/m3 (10/25.6% = 0.4 mg/m3).
            
            
              § 90.102
              Transfer; notice.
              (a) Whenever a part 90 miner is transferred in order to meet the applicable standard, the operator shall transfer the miner to an existing position at the same coal mine on the same shift or shift rotation on which the miner was employed immediately before the transfer. The operator may transfer a part 90 miner to a different coal mine, a newly-created position or a position on a different shift or shift rotation if the miner agrees in writing to the transfer. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply when the respirable dust concentration in a part 90 miner's work position complies with the applicable standard but circumstances, such as reductions in workforce or changes in operational status, require a change in the miner's job or shift assignment.
              (b) On or before the 20th calendar day following receipt of notification from MSHA that a part 90 miner is employed at the mine, the operator shall give the District Manager written notice of the occupation and, if applicable, the MMU unit to which the part 90 miner shall be assigned on the 21st calendar day following receipt of the notification from MSHA.
              (c) After the 20th calendar day following receipt of notification from MSHA that a part 90 miner is employed at the mine, the operator shall give the District Manager written notice before any transfer of a part 90 miner. This notice shall include the scheduled date of the transfer.
            
            
              § 90.103
              Compensation.
              (a) The operator shall compensate each part 90 miner at not less than the regular rate of pay received by that miner immediately before exercising the option under § 90.3.
              (b) Whenever a part 90 miner is transferred, the operator shall compensate the miner at not less than the regular rate of pay received by that miner immediately before the transfer.
              (c) Once a miner has been placed in a position in compliance with the provisions of part 90, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply when the part 90 miner initiates and accepts a change in work assignment for reasons of job preference.
              (d) The operator shall compensate each miner who is a section 203(b) miner on January 31, 1981, at not less than the regular rate of pay that the miner is required to receive under section 203(b) of the Act immediately before the effective date of this part.

              (e) In addition to the compensation required to be paid under paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section, the operator shall pay each part 90 miner the actual wage increases that accrue to the classification to which the miner is assigned.
              (f) If a miner is temporarily employed in an occupation other than his or her regular work classification for two months or more before exercising the option under § 90.3, the miner's regular rate of pay for purposes of paragraph (a) and (b) of this section is the higher of the temporary or regular rates of pay. If the temporary assignment is for less than two months, the operator may pay the part 90 miner at his or her regular work classification rate regardless of the temporary wage rate.
              (g) If a part 90 miner is transferred, and the Secretary subsequently notifies the miner that notice of the miner's eligibility to exercise the part 90 option was incorrect, the operator shall retain the affected miner in the current position to which the miner is assigned and continue to pay the affected miner the applicable rate of pay provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section, until:
              (1) The affected miner and operator agree in writing to a position with pay at not less than the regular rate of pay for that occupation; or
              (2) A position is available at the same coal mine in both the same occupation and on the same shift on which the miner was employed immediately before exercising the option under § 90.3 or under the old section 203(b) program (36 FR 20601, October 27, 1971).
              (i) When such a position is available, the operator shall offer the available position in writing to the affected miner with pay at not less than the regular rate of pay for that occupation.
              (ii) If the affected miner accepts the available position in writing, the operator shall implement the miner's reassignment upon notice of the miner's acceptance. If the miner does not accept the available position in writing, the miner may be reassigned and protections under part 90 shall not apply. Failure by the miner to act on the written offer of the available position within 15 days after notice of the offer is received from the operator shall operate as an election not to accept the available position.
            
            
              § 90.104
              Waiver of rights; re-exercise of option.
              (a) A part 90 miner may waive his or her rights and be removed from MSHA's active list of miners who have rights under part 90 by:
              (1) Giving written notification to the Chief, Division of Health, Coal Mine Safety and Health, MSHA, that the miner waives all rights under this part;
              (2) Applying for and accepting a position in an area of a mine which the miner knows has an average respirable dust concentration exceeding the applicable standard; or
              (3) Refusing to accept another position offered by the operator at the same coal mine that meets the requirements of §§ 90.100, 90.101 and 90.102(a) after dust sampling shows that the present position exceeds the applicable standard.
              (b) If rights under part 90 are waived, the miner gives up all rights under part 90 until the miner re-exercises the option in accordance with § 90.3(e) (Part 90 option; notice of eligibility; exercise of option).
              (c) If rights under part 90 are waived, the miner may re-exercise the option under this part in accordance with § 90.3(e) (Part 90 option; notice of eligibility; exercise of option) at any time.

              § 90.201
              Sampling; general and technical requirements.
              (a) An approved coal mine dust personal sampler unit (CMDPSU) shall be used to take samples of the concentration of respirable coal mine dust in the working environment of each part 90 miner as required by this part. On February 1, 2016, part 90 miners shall be sampled only with an approved continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM) as required by this part and an approved CMDPSU shall not be used, unless notified by the Secretary to continue to use an approved CMDPSU to conduct quarterly sampling.

              (b) If using a CMDPSU, the sampling device shall be worn or carried to and from each part 90 miner. If using a CPDM, the sampling device shall be worn by the part 90 miner at all times. Approved sampling devices shall be operated portal-to-portal and shall remain operational during the part 90 miner's entire shift, which includes the time spent performing normal work duties and while traveling to and from the assigned work location. If the work shift to be sampled is longer than 12 hours and the sampling device is:
              (1) A CMDPSU, the operator shall switch-out the unit's sampling pump prior to the 13th-hour of operation.
              (2) A CPDM, the operator shall switch-out the CPDM with a fully charged device prior to the 13th-hour of operation.
              (c) Unless otherwise directed by the District Manager, the respirable dust samples required under this part using a CMDPSU shall be taken by placing the sampling device as follows:
              (1) On the part 90 miner;
              (2) On the piece of equipment which the part 90 miner operates within 36 inches of the normal working position; or

              § 90.300
              Respirable dust control plan; filing requirements.
              (a) If an operator abates a violation of the applicable standard by reducing the respirable dust level in the position of the part 90 miner, the operator shall submit to the District Manager for approval a written respirable dust control plan for the part 90 miner in the position identified in the citation within 15 calendar days after the citation is terminated. The respirable dust control plan and revisions thereof shall be suitable to the conditions and the mining system of the coal mine and shall be adequate to continuously maintain respirable dust to at or below the applicable standard for that part 90 miner.
              (b) Each respirable dust control plan shall include at least the following:
              (1) The mine identification number assigned by MSHA, the operator's name, mine name, mine address, and mine telephone number and the name, address and telephone number of the principal officer in charge of health and safety at the mine;
              (2) The name and MSHA Individual Identification Number of the part 90 miner and the position at the mine to which the plan applies;
              (3) A detailed description of the specific respirable dust control measures used to continuously maintain concentrations of respirable coal mine dust at or below the applicable standard; and
              (4) A detailed description of how each of the respirable dust control measures described in response to paragraph (b)(3) of this section will continue to be used by the operator, including at least the specific time, place, and manner the control measures will be used.
            
            
              § 90.301
              Respirable dust control plan; approval by District Manager; copy to part 90 miner.

              (a) The District Manager will approve respirable dust control plans on a mine-by-mine basis. When approving respirable dust control plans, the District Manager shall consider whether:
              
              (1) The respirable dust control measures would be likely to maintain concentrations of respirable coal mine dust at or below the applicable standard; and
              (2) The operator's compliance with all provisions of the respirable dust control plan could be objectively ascertained by MSHA.
              (b) MSHA may take respirable dust samples to determine whether the respirable dust control measures in the operator's plan effectively maintain concentrations of respirable coal mine dust at or below the applicable standard.
              (c) The operator shall comply with all provisions of each respirable dust control plan upon notice from MSHA that the respirable dust control plan is approved.
              (d) The operator shall provide a copy of the current respirable dust control plan required under this part to the part 90 miner. The operator shall not post the original or a copy of the plan on the mine bulletin board.
              (e) The operator may review respirable dust control plans and submit proposed revisions to such plans to the District Manager for approval.

            § 100.1
            Scope and purpose.
            This part provides the criteria and procedures for proposing civil penalties under sections 105 and 110 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). The purpose of this part is to provide a fair and equitable procedure for the application of the statutory criteria in determining proposed penalties for violations, to maximize the incentives for mine operators to prevent and correct hazardous conditions, and to assure the prompt and efficient processing and collection of penalties.
          
          
            § 100.2
            Applicability.
            The criteria and procedures in this part are applicable to all proposed assessments of civil penalties for violations of the Mine Act and the standards and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Mine Act, as amended. MSHA shall review each citation and order and shall make proposed assessments of civil penalties.
          
          
            § 100.3
            Determination of penalty amount; regular assessment.
            (a) General. (1) Except as provided in § 100.5(e), the operator of any mine in which a violation occurs of a mandatory health or safety standard or who violates any other provision of the Mine Act, as amended, shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $72,620. Each occurrence of a violation of a mandatory safety or health standard may constitute a separate offense. The amount of the proposed civil penalty shall be based on the criteria set forth in sections 105(b) and 110(i) of the Mine Act. These criteria are:
            (i) The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the operator charged;
            (ii) The operator's history of previous violations;
            (iii) Whether the operator was negligent;
            (iv) The gravity of the violation;
            (v) The demonstrated good faith of the operator charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of a violation; and
            (vi) The effect of the penalty on the operator's ability to continue in business.
            (2) A regular assessment is determined by first assigning the appropriate number of penalty points to the violation by using the appropriate criteria and tables set forth in this section. The total number of penalty points will then be converted into a dollar amount under the penalty conversion table in paragraph (g) of this section. The penalty amount will be adjusted for demonstrated good faith in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
            (b) The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the operator charged. The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the mine operator's business is calculated by using both the size of the mine cited and the size of the mine's controlling entity. The size of coal mines and their controlling entities is measured by coal production. The size of metal and nonmetal mines and their controlling entities is measured by hours worked. The size of independent contractors is measured by the total hours worked at all mines. Penalty points for size are assigned based on Tables I to V. As used in these tables, the terms “annual tonnage” and “annual hours worked” mean coal produced and hours worked in the previous calendar year. In cases where a full year of data is not available, the coal produced or hours worked is prorated to an annual basis. This criterion accounts for a maximum of 25 penalty points.

              ER22MR07.026
            
            (c) History of previous violations. An operator's history of previous violations is based on both the total number of violations and the number of repeat violations of the same citable provision of a standard in a preceding 15-month period. Only assessed violations that have been paid or finally adjudicated, or have become final orders of the Commission will be included in determining an operator's history. The repeat aspect of the history criterion in paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies only after an operator has received 10 violations or an independent contractor operator has received 6 violations.
            (1) Total number of violations. For mine operators, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the number of violations per inspection day (VPID)(Table VI). Penalty points are not assigned for mines with fewer than 10 violations in the specified history period. For independent contractors, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the total number of violations at all mines (Table VII). This aspect of the history criterion accounts for a maximum of 25 penalty points.
            
              
              ER22MR07.027
            

            (2) Repeat violations of the same standard. Repeat violation history is based on the number of violations of the same citable provision of a standard in a preceding 15-month period. For coal and metal and nonmetal mine operators with a minimum of six repeat violations, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the number of repeat violations per inspection day (RPID) (Table VIII). For independent contractors, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the number of violations at all mines (Table IX). This aspect of the history criterion accounts for a maximum of 20 penalty points (Table VIII).
            
              ER22MR07.028
            
            
            (d) Negligence. Negligence is conduct, either by commission or omission, which falls below a standard of care established under the Mine Act to protect miners against the risks of harm. Under the Mine Act, an operator is held to a high standard of care. A mine operator is required to be on the alert for conditions and practices in the mine that affect the safety or health of miners and to take steps necessary to correct or prevent hazardous conditions or practices. The failure to exercise a high standard of care constitutes negligence. The negligence criterion assigns penalty points based on the degree to which the operator failed to exercise a high standard of care. When applying this criterion, MSHA considers mitigating circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, actions taken by the operator to prevent or correct hazardous conditions or practices. This criterion accounts for a maximum of 50 penalty points, based on conduct evaluated according to Table X.
            
              
              ER22MR07.029
            
            (e) Gravity. Gravity is an evaluation of the seriousness of the violation. This criterion accounts for a maximum of 88 penalty points, as derived from the Tables XI through XIII. Gravity is determined by the likelihood of the occurrence of the event against which a standard is directed; the severity of the illness or injury if the event has occurred or was to occur; and the number of persons potentially affected if the event has occurred or were to occur.

              ER22MR07.031
            
            (f) Demonstrated good faith of the operator in abating the violation. This criterion provides a 10% reduction in the penalty amount of a regular assessment where the operator abates the violation within the time set by the inspector.
            (g) Penalty conversion table. The penalty conversion table is used to convert the total penalty points to a dollar amount.

            (h) The effect of the penalty on the operator's ability to continue in business. MSHA presumes that the operator's ability to continue in business will not be affected by the assessment of a civil penalty. The operator may, however, submit information to the District Manager concerning the financial status of the business. If the information provided by the operator indicates that the penalty will adversely affect the operator's ability to continue in business, the penalty may be reduced.

            § 100.5
            Determination of penalty amount; special assessment.
            (a) MSHA may elect to waive the regular assessment under § 100.3 if it determines that conditions warrant a special assessment.
            (b) When MSHA determines that a special assessment is appropriate, the proposed penalty will be based on the six criteria set forth in § 100.3(a). All findings shall be in narrative form.
            (c) Any operator who fails to correct a violation for which a citation has been issued under Section 104(a) of the Mine Act within the period permitted for its correction may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $7,867 for each day during which such failure or violation continues.
            (d) Any miner who willfully violates the mandatory safety standards relating to smoking or the carrying of smoking materials, matches, or lighters shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $332 for each occurrence of such violation.

            (e) Violations that are deemed to be flagrant under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $266,275. For purposes of this section, a flagrant violation means “a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.”

            § 100.6
            Procedures for review of citations and orders; procedures for assessment of civil penalties and conferences.
            (a) All parties shall be afforded the opportunity to review with MSHA each citation and order issued during an inspection. It is within the sole discretion of MSHA to grant a request for a conference and to determine the nature of the conference.
            (b) Upon notice by MSHA, all parties will have 10 days within which to submit additional information or request a safety and health conference with the District Manager or designee. A conference request may include a request to be notified of, and to participate in, a conference initiated by another party. A conference request must be in writing and must include a brief statement of the reason why each citation or order should be conferenced.
            (c) When a conference is conducted, the parties may submit any additional relevant information relating to the violation, either prior to or at the conference. To expedite the conference, the official assigned to the case may contact the parties to discuss the issues involved prior to the conference.
            (d) MSHA will consider all relevant information submitted in a timely manner by the parties with respect to the violation. When the facts warrant a finding that no violation occurred, the citation or order will be vacated. Upon conclusion of the conference, or expiration of the conference request period, all citations that are abated and all orders will be promptly referred to MSHA's Office of Assessments. The Office of Assessments will use the citations, orders, and inspector's evaluation as the basis for determining the appropriate amount of a proposed penalty.
          
          
            § 100.7
            Notice of proposed penalty; notice of contest.
            (a) A notice of proposed penalty will be issued and served by certified mail, or the equivalent, upon the party to be charged and by regular mail to the representative of miners at the mine after the time permitted to request a conference under § 100.6 expires, or upon the completion of a conference, or upon review by MSHA of additional information submitted in a timely manner.
            (b) Upon receipt of the notice of proposed penalty, the party charged shall have 30 days to either:
            (1) Pay the proposed assessment. Acceptance by MSHA of payment tendered by the party charged will close the case.
            (2) Notify MSHA in writing of the intention to contest the proposed penalty. When MSHA receives the notice of contest, it advises the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission) of such notice. No proposed penalty which has been contested before the Commission shall be compromised, mitigated or settled except with the approval of the Commission.
            (c) If the proposed penalty is not paid or contested within 30 days of receipt, the proposed penalty becomes a final order of the Commission and is not subject to review by any court or agency.
          
          
            § 100.8
            Service.
            (a) All operators are required by part 41 (Notification of Legal Identity) of this chapter to file with MSHA the name and address of record of the operator. All representatives of miners are required by part 40 (Representative of Miners) of this chapter to file with MSHA the mailing address of the person or organization acting in a representative capacity. Proposed penalty assessments delivered to those addresses shall constitute service.
            (b) If any of the parties choose to have proposed penalty assessments mailed to a different address, the Office of Assessments must be notified in writing of the new address. Delivery to this address shall also constitute service.

            (c) Service for operators who fail to file under part 41 of this chapter will be upon the last known business address recorded with MSHA.

            § 104.1
            Purpose and scope.
            This part establishes the criteria and procedures for determining whether a mine operator has established a pattern of significant and substantial (S&S) violations at a mine. It implements section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) by addressing mines with an inspection history of recurrent S&S violations of mandatory safety or health standards that demonstrate a mine operator's disregard for the health and safety of miners. The purpose of the procedures in this part is the restoration of effective safe and healthful conditions at such mines.
          
          
            § 104.2
            Pattern criteria.
            (a) At least once each year, MSHA will review the compliance and accident, injury, and illness records of mines to determine if any mines meet the pattern of violations criteria. MSHA's review to identify mines with a pattern of S&S violations will include:
            (1) Citations for S&S violations;
            (2) Orders under section 104(b) of the Mine Act for not abating S&S violations;
            (3) Citations and withdrawal orders under section 104(d) of the Mine Act, resulting from the mine operator's unwarrantable failure to comply;
            (4) Imminent danger orders under section 107(a) of the Mine Act;
            (5) Orders under section 104(g) of the Mine Act requiring withdrawal of miners who have not received training and who MSHA declares to be a hazard to themselves and others;
            (6) Enforcement measures, other than section 104(e) of the Mine Act, that have been applied at the mine;
            (7) Other information that demonstrates a serious safety or health management problem at the mine, such as accident, injury, and illness records; and
            (8) Mitigating circumstances.
            (b) MSHA will post the specific pattern criteria on its Web site.
          
          
            § 104.3
            Issuance of notice.
            (a) When a mine has a pattern of violations, the District Manager will issue a pattern of violations notice to the mine operator that specifies the basis for the Agency's action. The District Manager will also provide a copy of this notice to the representative of miners.
            (b) The mine operator shall post the pattern of violations notice issued under this part on the mine bulletin board. The pattern of violations notice shall remain posted at the mine until MSHA terminates it under § 104.4 of this part.
            (c) If MSHA finds any S&S violation within 90 days after issuance of the pattern notice, MSHA will issue an order for the withdrawal of all persons from the affected area, except those persons referred to in section 104(c) of the Mine Act, until the violation has been abated.
            (d) If a withdrawal order is issued under paragraph (c) of this section, any subsequent S&S violation will result in a withdrawal order that will remain in effect until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated.
          
          
            § 104.4
            Termination of notice.

            (a) Termination of a section 104(e)(1) pattern of violations notice shall occur when an MSHA inspection of the entire mine finds no S&S violations or if MSHA does not issue a withdrawal order in accordance with section 104(e)(1) of the Mine Act within 90 days after the issuance of the pattern of violations notice.
            
            (b) The mine operator may request an inspection of the entire mine or portion of the mine. MSHA will not provide advance notice of the inspection and will determine the scope of the inspection. Inspections of portions of the mine, within 90 days, that together cover the entire mine shall constitute an inspection of the entire mine for the purposes of this part.
