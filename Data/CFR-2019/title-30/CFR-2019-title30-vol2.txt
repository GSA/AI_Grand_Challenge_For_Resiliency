      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

            Subpart A—General Provisions
            
              § 203.0
              What definitions apply to this part?
              
                Authorized field means a field:
              (1) Located in a water depth of at least 200 meters and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;
              (2) That includes one or more pre-Act leases; and
              (3) From which no current pre-Act lease produced, other than test production, before November 28, 1995.
              
                Certified unsuccessful well means an original well or a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth (i.e., length) of at least 10,000 feet, on your lease that:
              (1) You begin drilling on or after March 26, 2003, and before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep and that is not a non-converted lease, or on or after May 18, 2007, and before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep;

              (2) You begin drilling before your lease produces gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet true vertical depth subsea (TVD SS), (i.e., below the datum at mean sea level);
              (3) You drill to at least 18,000 feet TVD SS with a target reservoir on your lease, identified from seismic and related data, deeper than that depth;
              (4) Fails to meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A, and does not produce gas or oil, or meets those producibility requirements and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) agrees it is not commercially producible; and

              (5) For which you have provided the notices and information required under § 203.47.
              
              
                Complete application means an original and two copies of the six reports consisting of the data specified in §§ 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89, along with one set of digital information, which Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) has reviewed and found complete.
              
                Deep well means either an original well or a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS and less than 20,000 feet TVD SS. A deep well subsequently re-perforated at less than 15,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still a deep well.
              
                Determination means the binding decision by BSEE on whether your field qualifies for relief or how large a royalty-suspension volume must be to make the field economically viable.
              
                Development project means a project to develop one or more oil or gas reservoirs located on one or more contiguous leases that have had no production (other than test production) before the current application for royalty relief and are either:
              (1) Located in a planning area offshore Alaska; or
              (2) Located in the GOM in a water depth of at least 200 meters and wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and were issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000.
              
                Draft application means the preliminary set of information and assumptions you submit to seek a nonbinding assessment on whether a field could be expected to qualify for royalty relief.
              
                Eligible lease means a lease that:
              (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 1995, and before November 28, 2000;
              (2) Is located in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths of 200 meters or deeper;
              (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; and
              (4) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension volume.
              
                Expansion project means a project that meets the following requirements:
              (1) You must propose the project in a (BOEM) Development and Production Plan, a BOEM Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD), or a BOEM Supplement to a DOCD, approved by the Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995.
              (2) The project must be located on either:
              (i) A pre-Act lease in the GOM, or a lease in the GOM issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000, located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or
              (ii) A lease in a planning area offshore Alaska.
              (3) On a pre-Act lease in the GOM, the project:
              (i) Must significantly increase the ultimate recovery of resources from one or more reservoirs that have not previously produced (extending recovery from reservoirs already in production does not constitute a significant increase); and

              (ii) Must involve a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-leg platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, multiple well project, etc.).
              (4) For a lease issued in a planning area offshore Alaska, or in the GOM after November 28, 2000, the project must involve a new well drilled into a reservoir that has not previously produced.
              (5) On a lease in the GOM, the project must not include a reservoir the production from which an RSV under §§ 203.30 through 203.36 or §§ 203.40 through 203.48 would be applied.
              
                Fabrication (or start of construction) means evidence of an irreversible commitment to a concept and scale of development. Evidence includes copies of a binding contract between you (as applicant) and a fabrication yard, a letter from a fabricator certifying that continuous construction has begun, and a receipt for the customary down payment.
              
                Field means an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological structural feature or stratigraphic trapping condition. Two or more reservoirs may be in a field, separated vertically by intervening impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both.
              
                Lease means a lease or unit.
              
                New production means any production from a current pre-Act lease from which no royalties are due on production, other than test production, before November 28, 1995. Also, it means any additional production resulting from new lease-development activities on a lease issued in a sale after November 28, 2000, or a current pre-Act lease under a BOEM DOCD or a BOEM Supplement approved by the Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995.
              
                Nonbinding assessment means an opinion by BSEE of whether your field could qualify for royalty relief. It is based on your draft application and does not entitle the field to relief.
              
                Non-converted lease means a lease located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep issued in a lease sale held after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, whose original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas production and the lessee has not exercised the option under § 203.49 to replace the lease terms for royalty relief with those in § 203.0 and §§ 203.40 through 203.48.
              
                Original well means a well that is drilled without utilizing an existing wellbore. An original well includes all sidetracks drilled from the original wellbore either before the drilling rig moves off the well location or after a temporary rig move that BSEE agrees was forced by a weather or safety threat and drilling resumes within 1 year. A bypass from an original well (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the original well.
              
                Participating area means that part of the unit area that BSEE determines is reasonably proven by drilling and completion of producible wells, geological and geophysical information, and engineering data to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities.
              
                Performance conditions mean minimum conditions you must meet, after we have granted relief and before production begins, to remain qualified for that relief. If you do not meet each one of these performance conditions, we consider it a change in material fact significant enough to invalidate our original evaluation and approval.
              
                Phase 1 ultra-deep well means an ultra-deep well on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep for which drilling began before May 18, 2007, and that begins production before May 3, 2009, or that meets the requirements to be a certified unsuccessful well.
              
                Phase 2 ultra-deep well means an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007; and that either meets the requirements to be a certified unsuccessful well or that begins production:
              (1) Before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date on a non-converted lease; or
              (2) Before May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or
              (3) Before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
              
                Phase 3 ultra-deep well means an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, and that begins production:
              (1) On or after the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date on a non-converted lease; or
              (2) On or after May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or
              (3) On or after May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
              
                Pre-Act lease means a lease that:
              (1) Results from a sale held before November 28, 1995;
              (2) Is located in the GOM in water depths of 200 meters or deeper; and
              (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
              
                Production means all oil, gas, and other relevant products you save, remove, or sell from a tract or those quantities allocated to your tract under a unitization formula, as measured for the purposes of determining the amount of royalty payable to the United States.
              
                Project means any activity that requires at least a permit to drill.
              
                Qualified deep well means:

              (1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, a deep well for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, before May 3, 2009, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.44;
              (2) On a non-converted lease, a deep well that produces natural gas (other than test production) before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date from a reservoir that has not produced from a deep well on any lease; or
              (3) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep, a deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production before May 3, 2013, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.44.
              
                Qualified ultra-deep well means:
              (1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.35 or § 203.44, as applicable; or
              (2) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep, or on a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.35.
              
                Qualified well means either a qualified deep well or a qualified ultra-deep well.
              
                Redetermination means our reconsideration of our determination on royalty relief because you request it after:
              (1) We have rejected your application;
              (2) We have granted relief but you want a larger suspension volume;
              (3) We withdraw approval; or
              (4) You renounce royalty relief.
              
                Renounce means action you take to give up relief after we have granted it and before you start production.
              
                Reservoir means an underground accumulation of oil or natural gas, or both, characterized by a single pressure system and segregated from other such accumulations.
              
                Royalty suspension (RS) lease means a lease that:
              (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 2000;
              (2) Is in locations or planning areas specified in a particular Notice of OCS Lease Sale offering that lease; and

              (3) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension specified in a Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.
              
              
                Royalty suspension supplement (RSS) means a royalty suspension volume resulting from drilling a certified unsuccessful well that is applied to future natural gas and oil production generated at any drilling depth on, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, the same lease.
              
                Royalty suspension volume (RSV) means a volume of production from a lease that is not subject to royalty under the provisions of this part.
              
                Sidetrack means, for the purpose of this subpart, a well resulting from drilling an additional hole to a new objective bottom-hole location by leaving a previously drilled hole. A sidetrack also includes drilling a well from a platform slot reclaimed from a previously drilled well or re-entering and deepening a previously drilled well. A bypass from a sidetrack (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole, or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the sidetrack.
              
                Sidetrack measured depth means the actual distance or length in feet a sidetrack is drilled beginning where it exits a previously drilled hole to the bottom hole of the sidetrack, that is, to its total depth.
              
                Sunk costs for an authorized field means the after-tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for exploration, development, and production from the spud date of the first discovery on the field to the date we receive your complete application for royalty relief. The discovery well must be qualified as producible under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A. Sunk costs include the rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery well that you incurred before its spud date.
              
              
                Sunk costs for an expansion or development project means the after-tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for only the first well that encounters hydrocarbons in the reservoir(s) included in the application and that meets the producibility requirements under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A on each lease participating in the application. Sunk costs include rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery wells that you incurred before their spud dates.
              
                Ultra-deep well means either an original well or a sidetrack completed with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS. An ultra-deep well subsequently re-perforated less than 20,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still an ultra-deep well.
              
                Withdraw means action we take on a field that has qualified for relief if you have not met one or more of the performance conditions.
            
            
              § 203.1
              What is BSEE's authority to grant royalty relief?
              The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337, as amended by the OCS Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), Public Law 104-58 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-058 authorizes us to grant royalty relief in four situations.
              (a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote increased production.
              (b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to leases in the GOM that are west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and in the planning areas offshore Alaska.
              (c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of new production from any lease if:
              (1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);
              (2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);
              (3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA (before November 28, 1995);
              (4) We find that your new production would not be economic without royalty relief; and
              (5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or a supplementary DOCD, that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approved after November 28, 1995.
              (d) Under 42 U.S.C. 15904-15905, we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of gas production from deep and ultra-deep wells on a lease if:
              (1) Your lease is in shallow water (water less than 400 meters deep) and you produce from an ultra-deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS) or your lease is in waters entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep and you produce from a deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS);
              (2) Your lease is in the designated area of the GOM (wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude); and
              (3) Your lease is not eligible for deep water royalty relief.
            
            
              § 203.2
              How can I obtain royalty relief?
              We may reduce or suspend royalties for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases or projects that meet the criteria in the following table.
              
                
                  If you have a lease . . .
                  And if you . . .
                  Then we may grant you . . .
                
                
                  (a) With earnings that cannot sustain production (i.e., End-of-life lease),
                  Would abandon otherwise potentially recoverable resources but seek to increase production by operating beyond the point at which the lease is economic under the existing royalty rate,
                  A reduced royalty rate on current monthly production and a higher royalty rate on additional monthly production (see §§ 203.50 through 203.56).
                
                
                  
                  (b) Located in a designated GOM deep water area (i.e., 200 meters or greater) and acquired in a lease sale held before November 28, 1995, or after November 28, 2000,
                  Propose an expansion project and can demonstrate your project is uneconomic without royalty relief,
                  A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional production large enough to make the project economic (see §§ 203.60 through 203.79).
                
                
                  (c) Located in a designated GOM deep water area and acquired in a lease sale held before November 28, 1995 (Pre-Act lease),
                  

                  Are on a field from which no current pre-Act lease produced (other than test production) before November 28, 1995, (Authorized field,)
                  
                  A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional volume needed to make the field economic (see §§ 203.60 through 203.79).
                
                
                  (d) Located in a designated GOM deep water area and acquired in a lease sale held after November 28, 2000,
                  Propose a development project and can demonstrate that the suspension volume, if any, for your lease is not enough to make development economic,
                  A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional volume needed to make your project economic (see §§ 203.60 through 203.79).
                
                
                  (e) Where royalty relief would recover significant additional resources or, offshore Alaska or in certain areas of the GOM, would enable development,
                  Are not eligible to apply for end-of-life or deep water royalty relief, but show us you meet certain eligibility conditions,
                  A royalty modification in size, duration, or form that makes your lease or project economic (see § 203.80).
                
                
                  (f) Located in a designated GOM shallow water area and acquired in a lease sale held before January 1, 2001, or after January 1, 2004, or have exercised an option to substitute for royalty relief in your lease terms,

                  A royalty suspension for a volume of gas produced from successful deep and ultra-deep wells, or, for certain unsuccessful deep and ultra-deep wells, a smaller royalty suspension for a volume of gas or oil produced by all wells on your lease (see §§ 203.40 through 203.49).
                
                
                  (g) Located in a designated GOM shallow water area,
                  Drill and produce gas from an ultra-deep well on a lease that is not eligible for deep water royalty relief and you have not previously produced oil or gas from an ultra-deep well,
                  A royalty suspension for a volume of gas produced from successful ultra-deep and deep wells on your lease (see §§ 203.30 through 203.36).
                
                
                  (h) Located in planning areas offshore Alaska,
                  Propose an expansion project or propose a development project and can demonstrate that the project is uneconomic without relief or that the suspension volume, if any, for your lease is not enough to make development economic,
                  A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional volume needed to make your project economic (see §§ 203.60, 203.62, 203.67 through 203.70, 203.73, and 203.76 through 203.79).
                
              
            
            
              § 203.3
              Do I have to pay a fee to request royalty relief?
              When you submit an application or ask for a preview assessment, you must include a fee to reimburse us for our costs of processing your application or assessment. Federal policy and law require us to recover the cost of services that confer special benefits to identifiable non-Federal recipients. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 9701), Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, and the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996) authorize us to collect these fees.
              (a) We will specify the necessary fees for each of the types of royalty relief applications and possible BSEE audits in a Notice to Lessees. We will periodically update the fees to reflect changes in costs, as well as provide other information necessary to administer royalty relief.

              (b) You must file all payments electronically through the Fees for Services page on the BSEE Web site at http://www.bsee.gov, and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page with your application or assessment.

              § 203.4
              How do the provisions in this part apply to different types of leases and projects?

              The tables in this section summarize the similar application and approval provisions for the discretionary end-of-life and deep water royalty relief programs in §§ 203.50 to 203.91. Because royalty relief for deep gas on leases not subject to deep water royalty relief, as provided for under §§ 203.40 to 203.48, does not involve an application, its provisions do not parallel the other two royalty relief programs and are not summarized in this section.
              
              (a) We require the information elements indicated by an X in the following table and described in §§ 203.51, 203.62, and 203.81 through 203.89 for applications for royalty relief.

              Royalty Relief for Drilling Ultra-Deep Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief
              
                § 203.30
                Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result of drilling a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?
                Your lease may receive a royalty suspension volume (RSV) under §§ 203.31 through 203.36 if the lease meets all the requirements of this section.
                (a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters deep.
                (b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well, except as provided in § 203.31(b).
                (c) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water, it must either:
                (1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
                (2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under §§ 203.60 through 203.79.
              
              
                § 203.31
                If I have a qualified phase 2 or qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would that well earn for my lease?
                (a) Subject to the administrative requirements of § 203.35 and the price conditions in § 203.36, your qualified well earns your lease an RSV shown in the following table in billions of cubic feet (BCF) or in thousands of cubic feet (MCF) as prescribed in § 203.33:
                
                  
                    If you have a qualified phase 2 or qualified phase 3 ultra-deep wellthat is:
                    
                    Then your lease earns an RSV on this volume of gas production:
                  
                  
                    (1) An original well,
                    35 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (2) A sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 20,000 feet,
                    35 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (3) An ultra-deep short sidetrack that is a phase 2 ultra-deep well,
                    4 BCF plus 600 MCF timessidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 25 BCF.
                    
                  
                  
                    (4) An ultra-deep short sidetrack that is a phase 3 ultra-deep well,
                    0 BCF.
                  
                
                (b)(1) This paragraph applies if your lease:
                (i) Has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is less than 18,000 feet TVD SS;
                (ii) Was issued in a lease sale held between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005; and
                (iii) The terms of your lease expressly incorporate the provisions of §§ 203.41 through 203.47 as they existed at the time the lease was issued.

                (2) Subject to the administrative requirements of § 203.35 and the price conditions in § 203.36, your qualified well earns your lease an RSV shown in the following table in BCF or MCF as prescribed in § 203.33:
                
                  
                    If you have a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well that is . . .
                    Then your lease earns an RSV on this volume of gas production:
                  
                  
                    (i) An original well or a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 20,000 feet TVD SS,
                    10 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (ii) An ultra-deep short sidetrack,
                    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 10 BCF.
                  
                
                (c) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on production from qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells that:
                (1) Occurs before December 18, 2008, and
                (2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either § 203.31 or § 203.41.

                (d) The following examples illustrate how this section applies. These examples assume that your lease is located in the GOM west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude and in water less than 400 meters deep (see § 203.30(a)), has no existing deep or ultra-deep wells and that the price thresholds prescribed in § 203.36 have not been exceeded.
                
                
                  Example 1:

                  In 2008, you drill and begin producing from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS, and your lease has had no prior production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Assuming your lease has no deepwater royalty relief (see § 203.30(c)), your lease is eligible (according to § 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV under § 203.31 because it has not yet produced from a deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing. According to § 203.31(a), your 25,000 foot well qualifies your lease for this RSV because the well was drilled after the relief authorized here became effective (when the proposed version of this rule was published on May 18, 2007) and produced from an interval that meets the criteria for an ultra-deep well (i.e., is a phase 2 ultra-deep well as defined in § 203.0). Then in 2014, you drill and produce from another ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 29,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no additional RSV under this section when this second ultra-deep well produces, because your lease no longer meets the condition in (§ 203.30(b)) of no production from a deep well. However, any remaining RSV earned by the first ultra-deep well on your lease would be applied to production from both the first and the second ultra-deep wells as prescribed in § 203.33(a)(2), or § 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit.
                
                
                  Example 2:
                  In 2005, you spudded and began producing from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 23,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under this section from this phase 1 ultra-deep well (as defined in § 203.0) because you spudded the well before the publication date (May 18, 2007) of the proposed rule when royalty relief under § 203.31(a) became effective. However, this ultra-deep well may earn an RSV of 25 BCF for your lease under § 203.41 (that became effective May 3, 2004), if the lease is located in water depths partly or entirely less than 200 meters and has not previously produced from a deep well (§ 203.30(b)).
                
                
                  Example 3:
                  In 2000, you began producing from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and your lease is located in water 100 meters deep. Then in 2008, you drill and produce from a new ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 24,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under either this section or § 203.41 because the 16,000-foot well was drilled before we offered any way to earn an RSV for producing from a deep well (see dates in the definition of qualified well in § 203.0) and because the existence of the 16,000-foot well means the lease is not eligible (see § 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV for the 24,000-foot well. Because the lease existed in the year 2000, it cannot be eligible for the exception to this eligibility condition provided in § 203.31(b).
                
                
                  Example 4:

                  In 2008, you spud and produce from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,000 feet TVD SS, your lease is located in water 300 meters deep, and your lease has had no previous production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing because your lease meets the conditions in § 203.30 and the well fits the definition of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (in § 203.0). Then in 2010, you spud and produce from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS. Your 16,000-foot well earns no RSV because it is on a lease that already has a producing well at least 18,000 feet subsea (see § 203.42(a)), but any remaining RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would also be applied to production from the deep well as prescribed in § 203.33(a)(2), or § 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit and § 203.43(a)(2), or § 203.43(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit. However, if the 16,000-foot deep well does not begin production until 2016 (or if your lease were located in water less than 200 meters deep), then the 16,000-foot well would not be a qualified deep well because this well does not begin production within the interval specified in the definition of a qualified well in § 203.0, and the RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would not be applied to production from this (unqualified) deep well.
                
                
                  Example 5:
                  In 2008, you spud a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under § 203.41 when it begins producing. Then in 2011, you spud an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 26,000 feet TVD SS. Your 26,000-foot well becomes a qualified ultra-deep well because it meets the date and depth conditions in this definition under § 203.0 when it begins producing, but your lease earns no additional RSV under this section or § 203.41 because it is on a lease that already has production from a deep well (see § 203.30(b)). Both the qualified deep well and the qualified ultra-deep well would share your lease's total RSV of 15 BCF in the manner prescribed in §§ 203.33 and 203.43.
                
                
                  Example 6:
                  In 2008, you spud a qualified ultra-deep well that is a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of 21,000 feet and a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS. This well meets the definition of an ultra-deep well but is too long to be classified an ultra-deep short sidetrack in § 203.0. If your lease is located in 150 meters of water and has not previously produced from a deep well, your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF because it was drilled after the effective date for earning this RSV. Further, this RSV applies to gas production from this and any future qualified deep and qualified ultra-deep wells on your lease, as prescribed in § 203.33. The absence of an expiration date for earning an RSV on an ultra-deep well means this long sidetrack well becomes a qualified well whenever it starts production. If your sidetrack has a sidetrack measured depth of 14,000 feet and begins production in March 2009, it earns an RSV of 12.4 BCF under this section because it meets the definitions of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (production begins before the expiration date for the pre-existing relief in its water depth category) and an ultra-deep short sidetrack in § 203.0. However, if it does not begin production until 2010, it earns no RSV because it is too short as a phase 3 ultra-deep well to be a qualified ultra-deep well.
                
                
                  Example 7:
                  Your lease was issued in June 2004 and expressly incorporates the provisions of §§ 203.41 through 203.47 as they existed at that time. In January 2005, you spud a deep well (well no. 1) with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,800 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under § 203.41 when it begins producing. Then in February 2008, you spud an ultra-deep well (well no. 2) with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,300 feet that begins producing in November 2008, after well no. 1 has started production. Well no. 2 earns your lease an additional RSV of 10 BCF under paragraph (b) of this section because it begins production in time to be classified as a phase 2 ultra-deep well. If, on the other hand, well no. 2 had begun producing in June 2009, it would earn no additional RSV for the lease because it would be classified as a phase 3 ultra-deep well and thus is not entitled to the exception under paragraph (b) of this section.
                
              
              
                § 203.32
                What other requirements or restrictions apply to royalty relief for a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?
                (a) If a qualified ultra-deep well on your lease is within a unitized portion of your lease, the RSV earned by that well under this section applies only to your lease and not to other leases within the unit or to the unit as a whole.
                (b) If your qualified ultra-deep well is a directional well (either an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line, then either:
                (1) The lease with the perforated interval that initially produces earns the RSV or
                (2) If the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.
                (c) Any RSV earned under § 203.31 is in addition to any royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for your lease under § 203.45 that results from a different wellbore.
                (d) If your lease earns an RSV under § 203.31 and later produces from a deep well that is not a qualified well, the RSV is not forfeited or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV earned under § 203.31 to production from the non-qualified well.
                (e) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any RSVs allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 203.31.
                (f) Unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.
              
              
                
                § 203.33
                To which production do I apply the RSV earned by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease or in my unit?
                (a) You must apply the RSV allowed in § 203.31(a) and (b) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 18, 2007, reported on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A (OGOR-A) for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102. All gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production not subject to royalty, counts toward the total lease RSV earned by both deep or ultra-deep wells on the lease.
                (b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that is not within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions of § 203.36, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.31 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
                (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date the first qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
                (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44.
                (c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well where all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions of § 203.36, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.31 as follows:
                (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date that the first qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
                (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:
                (i) From qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44; and

                (ii) Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on other leases in participating areas of the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44 have been met. The allocated share under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease.
                
                
                  Example:
                  The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease B. There is one qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on the non-unitized portion of lease A that earns lease A an RSV of 35 BCF under § 203.31, one qualified deep well on the unitized portion of lease A (drilled after the ultra-deep well on the non-unitized portion of that lease) and a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease B that earns lease B a 35 BCF RSV under § 203.31. The participating area percentages allocate 40 percent of production from both of the unit qualified wells to lease A and 60 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF, and the unitized qualified well on lease A produces 18 BCF, and the qualified well on lease B produces 37 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which the lease A RSV applies is 34 BCF [12 + (18 + 37)(0.40)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies is 33 BCF [(18 + 37)(0.60)]. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.
                
                
                (d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (b) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under § 203.31 or § 203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production from or allocated to your lease that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.
              
              
                § 203.34
                To which production may an RSV earned by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease not be applied?

                You may not apply an RSV earned under § 203.31:
                
                (a) To production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
                (b) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of § 203.33;
                (c) To any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or
                (d) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:
                (1) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep; or
                (2) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.
              
              
                § 203.35
                What administrative steps must I take to use the RSV earned by a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?
                To use an RSV earned under § 203.31:
                (a) You must notify the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on all your ultra-deep wells.
                (b) Before beginning production, you must meet any production measurement requirements that the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, subpart L.
                (c)(1) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from any wells that would become qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells by satisfying the requirements of this section:
                (i) Provide written notification to the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development that production has begun; and
                (ii) Request confirmation of the size of the RSV earned by your lease.
                (2) If you produced from a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in paragraph (c)(1) of this section no later than January 20, 2009.
                (d) If you cannot produce from a well that otherwise meets the criteria for a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well that is an ultra-deep short sidetrack before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to 1 year, based on the circumstances of the particular well involved, if it meets all the following criteria.
                (1) The delay occurred after drilling reached the total depth in your well.
                (2) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin from the well before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep or before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep. You must provide a credible activity schedule with supporting documentation.
                (3) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your control, such as adverse weather and accidents which BSEE deems were unavoidable.
              
              
                § 203.36
                Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?
                (a) You must pay the Office of Natural Resources Revenue royalties on all gas production to which an RSV otherwise would be applied under § 203.33 for any calendar year in which the average daily closing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.
                
                  
                    A price threshold in year 2007 dollars of . . .

                    (ii) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(b) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well.
                  
                  
                    
                    (2) $4.55 per MMBtu,
                    (i) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 3 ultra-deep well unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold;
                  
                  
                     
                    (ii) The last 10 BCF of the 35 BCF of RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep issued before December 18, 2008, and that is not a non-converted lease;

                    (iv) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep issued on or after December 18, 2008, unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold; and
                  
                  
                     
                    (v) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease in water entirely more than 200 meters deep and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
                  
                  
                    (3) $4.08 per MMBtu,
                    (i) The first 20 BCF of RSV earned by a well that is located on a non-converted lease issued in OCS Lease Sale 178.
                  
                  
                    (4) $5.83 per MMBtu,
                    (i) The first 20 BCF of RSV earned by a well that is located on a non-converted lease issued in OCS Lease Sales 180, 182, 184, 185, or 187.
                  
                
                (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by:
                (1) Determining the percentage of change during the year in the Department of Commerce's implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product; and
                (2) Adjusting the threshold price for the previous year by that percentage.

                (c) The following examples illustrate how this section applies.
                
                
                  Example 1:
                  Assume that a lessee drills and begins producing from a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well in 2008 on a lease issued in 2004 in less than 200 meters of water that earns the lease an RSV of 35 BCF. Further, assume the well produces a total of 18 BCF by the end of 2009 and in both of those years, the average daily NYMEX closing natural gas price is less than $10.15 (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The lessee does not pay royalty on the 18 BCF because the gas price threshold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to the first 25 BCF of this RSV earned by this phase 2 ultra-deep well. In 2010, the well produces another 13 BCF. In that year, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price is greater than $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), but less than $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The first 7 BCF produced in 2010 will exhaust the first 25 BCF (that is subject to the $10.15 threshold) of the 35 BCF RSV that the well earned. The lessee must pay royalty on the remaining 6 BCF produced in 2010, because it is subject to the $4.55 per MMBtu threshold under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section which was exceeded.
                
                
                  Example 2:
                  Assume that a lessee:
                  (1) Drills and produces from well no.1, a qualified deep well in 2008 to a depth of 15,500 feet TVD SS that earns a 15 BCF RSV for the lease under § 203.41, which would be subject to a price threshold of $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), meaning the lease is partly or entirely in less than 200 meters of water;
                  (2) Later in 2008, drills and produces from well no. 2, a second qualified deep well to a depth of 17,000 feet TVD SS that earns no additional RSV (see § 203.41(c)(1)); and
                  (3) In 2015, drills and produces from well no. 3, a qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns no additional RSV since the lease already has an RSV established by prior deep well production. Further assume that in 2015, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). In 2015, any remaining RSV earned by well no. 1 (which would have been applied to production from well nos. 1 and 2 in the intervening years), would be applied to production from all three qualified wells. Because the price threshold applicable to that RSV was not exceeded, the production from all three qualified wells would be royalty-free until the 15 BCF RSV earned by well no. 1 is exhausted.
                
                
                  Example 3:

                  Assume the same initial facts regarding the three wells as in Example 2. Further assume that well no. 1 stopped producing in 2011 after it had produced 8 BCF, and that well no. 2 stopped producing in 2012 after it had produced 5 BCF. Two BCF of the RSV earned by well no. 1 remain. That RSV would be applied to production from well no. 3 until it is exhausted, and the lessee therefore would not pay royalty on those 2 BCF produced in 2015, because the $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) price threshold is not exceeded. The determination of which price threshold applies to deep gas production depends on when the first qualified well earned the RSV for the lease, not on which wells use the RSV.
                
                
                  Example 4:
                  Assume that in February 2010, a lessee completes and begins producing from an ultra-deep well (at a depth of 21,500 feet TVD SS) on a lease located in 325 meters of water with no prior production from any deep well and no deep water royalty relief. The ultra-deep well would be a phase 2 ultra-deep well (see definition in § 203.0), and would earn the lease an RSV of 35 BCF under §§ 203.30 and 203.31. Further assume that the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) during 2010. Because the lease is located in more than 200 but less than 400 meters of water, the $4.55 per MMBtu price threshold applies to the whole RSV (see paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section), and the lessee will owe royalty on all gas produced from the ultra-deep well in 2010.
                
                
                (d) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.
                (e) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV.
              
            
            
              Royalty Relief for Drilling Deep Gas Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief
              
                § 203.40
                Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result of drilling a deep well or a phase 1 ultra-deep well?
                Your lease may receive an RSV under §§ 203.41 through 203.44, and may receive an RSS under §§ 203.45 through 203.47, if it meets all the requirements of this section.
                (a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters deep.
                (b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper that commenced drilling either:
                (1) Before March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep; or
                (2) Before May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
                (c) In the case of a lease located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep, the lease was issued in a lease sale held either:
                (1) Before January 1, 2001;
                (2) On or after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, and, in cases where the original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas production, the lessee has exercised the option provided for in § 203.49; or
                (3) On or after January 1, 2004, and the lease terms provide for royalty relief under §§ 203.41 through 203.47. (Note: Because the original § 203.41 has been divided into new §§ 203.41 and 203.42 and subsequent sections have been redesignated as §§ 203.43 through 203.48, royalty relief in lease terms for leases issued on or after January 1, 2004, should be read as referring to §§ 203.41 through 203.48.)
                (d) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and less than 400 meters of water, it must either:
                (1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
                (2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under §§ 203.60 through 203.79.
              
              
                § 203.41
                If I have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would my lease earn?

                (a) To qualify for a suspension volume under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, your lease must meet the requirements in § 203.40 and the requirements in the following table.
                
                
                  
                    If your lease has not . . .
                    And if it later . . .
                    Then your lease . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) produced gas or oil from any deep well or ultra-deep well,
                    Has a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well,
                    earns an RSV specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
                  
                  
                    (2) produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval whose top is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
                    Has a qualified deep well with a perforated interval whose top is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well,
                    earns an RSV specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
                  
                
                (b) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table:
                
                  
                    If you have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well that is:
                    Then your lease earns an RSV on this volume of gas production:
                  
                  
                    (1) An original well with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
                    15 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (2) A sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
                    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 15 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (3) An original well with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet TVD SS,
                    25 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (4) A sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet TVD SS,
                    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 25 BCF.
                  
                
                (c) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table. The RSV specified in this paragraph is in addition to any RSV your lease already may have earned from a qualified deep well with a perforated interval whose top is from 15,000 feet to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS.
                
                  
                    If you have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well that is . . .
                    Then you earn an RSV on this amount of gas production:
                  
                  
                    (1) An original well or a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
                    0 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (2) An original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
                    10 BCF.
                  
                  
                    (3) A sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
                    4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 10 BCF.
                  
                
                (d) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on production from qualified wells on a lease that is located in water entirely deeper than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep that:
                (1) Occurs before December 18, 2008; and
                (2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either § 203.31 or § 203.41.

                (e) The following examples illustrate how this section applies, assuming your lease meets the location, prior production, and lease issuance conditions in § 203.40 and paragraph (a) of this section:
                
                
                  Example 1:
                  If you have a qualified deep well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSV of 15 BCF under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This RSV must be applied to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48. However, if the top of the perforated interval is 18,500 feet TVD SS, the RSV is 25 BCF according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
                
                
                  Example 2:
                  If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 6,789 feet, we round the measured depth to 6,800 feet and your lease earns an RSV of 8.08 BCF under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.
                
                
                  Example 3:

                  If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 19,500 feet, your lease earns an RSV of 15 BCF. This RSV would be applied to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48, even though 4 BCF plus 600 MCF per foot of sidetrack measured depth equals 15.7 BCF because paragraph (b)(2) of this section limits the RSV for a sidetrack at the amount an original well to the same depth would earn.
                
                
                  Example 4:
                  If you have drilled and produced a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS before March 26, 2003 (and the well therefore is not a qualified well and has earned no RSV under this section), and later drill:
                  (i) A deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns no RSV (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section);
                  (ii) A qualified deep well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSV of 10 BCF under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48; or
                  (iii) A qualified deep well that is a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack measured depth of 7,000 feet, your lease earns an RSV of 8.2 BCF under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.
                
                
                  Example 5:

                  If you have a qualified deep well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, and later drill a second qualified well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, we increase the total RSV for your lease from 15 BCF to 25 BCF under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. We will apply that RSV to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48. If the second well has a perforated interval the top of which is 22,000 feet TVD SS (instead of 19,000 feet), the total RSV for your lease would increase to 25 BCF only in 2 situations: (1) If the second well was a phase 1 ultra-deep well, i.e., if drilling began before May 18, 2007, or (2) the exception in § 203.31(b) applies. In both situations, your lease must be partly or entirely in less than 200 meters of water and production must begin on this well before May 3, 2009. If drilling of the second well began on or after May 18, 2007, the second well would be qualified as a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well and, unless the exception in § 203.31(b) applies, would not earn any additional RSV (as prescribed in § 203.30), so the total RSV for your lease would remain at 15 BCF.
                
                
                  Example 6:
                  If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 4,000 feet, and later drill a second qualified well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 8,000 feet, we increase the total RSV for your lease from 6.4 BCF [4 + (600 * 4,000)/1,000,000] to 15.2 BCF {6.4 + [4 + (600 * 8,000)/1,000,000)]} under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. We would apply that RSV to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48. The difference of 8.8 BCF represents the RSV earned by the second sidetrack that has a perforated interval the top of which is deeper than 18,000 feet TVD SS.
                
              
              
                § 203.42
                What conditions and limitations apply to royalty relief for deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells?
                The conditions and limitations in the following table apply to royalty relief under § 203.41.
                
                  
                    If . . .
                    Then . . .
                  
                  
                    (a) Your lease has produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
                    your lease cannot earn an RSV under § 203.41 as a result of drilling any subsequent deep wells or phase 1 ultra-deep wells.
                  
                  
                    (b) You determine RSV under § 203.41 for the first qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on your lease (whether an original well or a sidetrack) because you drilled and produced it within the time intervals set forth in the definitions for qualified wells,

                    that determination establishes the total RSV available for that drilling depth interval on your lease (i.e., either 15,000-18,000 feet TVD SS, or 18,000 feet TVD SS and deeper), regardless of the number of subsequent qualified wells you drill to that depth interval.
                  
                  
                    (c) A qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on your lease is within a unitized portion of your lease,
                    the RSV earned by that well under § 203.41 applies only to production from qualified wells on or allocated to your lease and not to other leases within the unit.
                  
                  
                    (d) Your qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well is a directional well (either an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line,
                    the lease with the perforated interval that initially produces earns the RSV. However, if the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.
                  
                  
                    (e) You earn an RSV under § 203.41,
                    that RSV is in addition to any RSS for your lease under § 203.45 that results from a different wellbore.
                  
                  
                    (f) Your lease earns an RSV under § 203.41 and later produces from a well that is not a qualified well,
                    the RSV is not forfeited or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV under § 203.41 to production from the non-qualified well.
                  
                  
                    (g) You qualify for an RSV under paragraphs (b) or (c) of § 203.41,
                    you still owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms.
                  
                  
                    
                    (h) You transfer your lease,
                    unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.
                  
                
                
                
                  Example to paragraph (b):
                  If your first qualified deep well is a sidetrack with a perforated interval whose top is 16,000 feet TVD SS and earns an RSV of 12.5 BCF, and you later drill a qualified original deep well to 17,000 feet TVD SS, the RSV for your lease remains at 12.5 BCF and does not increase to 15 BCF. However, under paragraph (c) of § 203.41, if you subsequently drill a qualified deep well to a depth of 18,000 feet or greater TVD SS, you may earn an additional RSV.
                
              
              
                § 203.43
                To which production do I apply the RSV earned from qualified deep wells or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep wells on my lease?
                (a) You must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.41(b) and (c) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 3, 2004, reported on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102, as and to the extent prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.
                (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSV.
                (2) Production to which an RSS applies under §§ 203.45 and 203.46 does not count toward the lease RSV.
                (b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when no part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
                (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:
                (i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;
                (ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or
                (iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).

                (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44.
                
                
                  Example 1:
                  On a lease in water less than 200 meters deep, you began drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,200 feet TVD SS in September 2003, that became a qualified deep well in July 2004, when it began producing and using the RSV that it earned. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,600 feet TVD SS, which becomes a qualified deep well when production begins in August 2008. The first well earned an RSV of 25 BCF (see § 203.41(a)(1) and (b)(3)). You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in August 2008 to production from both wells until the 25 BCF RSV is fully utilized according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the second well had begun production in August 2009, it would not be a qualified deep well because it started production after expiration in May 2009 of the ability to qualify for royalty relief in this water depth, and could not share any of the remaining RSV (see definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0).
                
                
                  Example 2:
                  On a lease in water between 200 and 400 meters deep, you begin drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,100 feet TVD SS in November 2010 that becomes a qualified deep well in June 2011 when it begins producing and using the RSV. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 15,300 feet TVD SS which becomes a qualified deep well by beginning production in October 2011 (see definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0). Only the first well earns an RSV equal to 15 BCF (see § 203.41(a) and (b)). You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in October 2011 to production from both qualified deep wells until the 15 BCF RSV is fully utilized according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
                
                

                (c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed under § 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:
                (i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;
                (ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or
                (iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
                (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:
                (i) From all qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44; and,
                (ii) Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on unitized areas of other leases in the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44 have been met.

                (3) The allocated share under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.
                
                
                  Example:
                  The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease B. There is one qualified 19,000-foot TVD SS deep well on the non-unitized portion of lease A, one qualified 18,500-foot TVD SS deep well on the unitized portion of lease A, and a qualified 19,400-foot TVD SS deep well on lease B. The participating area percentages allocate 32 percent of production from both of the unit qualified deep wells to lease A and 68 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF and the unitized qualified deep well on lease A produces 15 BCF, and the qualified deep well on lease B produces 10 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which the lease an RSV applies is 20 BCF [12 + (15 + 10) * (0.32)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies is 17 BCF [(15 + 10) * (0.68)].
                
                
                (d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (c) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under § 203.31 or § 203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.
                (e) You may not apply the RSV allowed under § 203.41 to:
                (1) Production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified deep well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
                (2) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;
                (3) Any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or
                (4) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:
                (i) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or
                (ii) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.
              
              
                § 203.44
                What administrative steps must I take to use the royalty suspension volume?
                (a) You must notify the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on all deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells; and
                (b) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from all wells that would become qualified wells by satisfying the requirements of this section, you must:

                (1) Provide written notification to the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development that production has begun; and
                
                (2) Request confirmation of the size of the royalty suspension volume earned by your lease.
                (c) Before beginning production, you must meet any production measurement requirements that the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, subpart L.
                (d) You must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section by January 20, 2009, if you produced before December 18, 2008, from a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters and less than 400 meters deep.
                (e) The BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to one year for a well that cannot begin production before the applicable date prescribed in the definition of “qualified deep well” in § 203.0 if it meets all of the following criteria.
                (1) The well otherwise meets the criteria in the definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0.
                (2) The delay in production occurred after reaching total depth in the well.
                (3) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin from the well before the applicable deadline in the definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0. You must provide a credible activity schedule with supporting documentation.
                (4) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your control, such as adverse weather and accidents which BSEE deems were unavoidable.
              
              
                § 203.45
                If I drill a certified unsuccessful well, what royalty relief will my lease earn?
                Your lease may earn a royalty suspension supplement. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the royalty suspension supplement is in addition to any royalty suspension volume your lease may earn under § 203.41.
                (a) If you drill a certified unsuccessful well and you satisfy the administrative requirements of § 203.47, subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, your lease earns an RSS shown in the following table. The RSS is shown in billions of cubic feet of gas equivalent (BCFE) or in thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent (MCFE) and is applicable to oil and gas production as prescribed in § 203.46.
                
                  
                    If you have a certified unsuccessful well that is:—
                    Then your lease earns an RSS on this volume of oil and gas production as prescribed in this section and § 203.46:—
                  
                  
                    (1) An original well and your lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well,
                    5 BCFE.
                  
                  
                    (2) A sidetrack (with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 10,000 feet) and your lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well,
                    0.8 BCFE plus 120 MCFE times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 5 BCFE.
                  
                  
                    (3) An original well or a sidetrack (with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 10,000 feet) and your lease has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
                    2 BCFE.
                  
                
                (b) This paragraph applies to oil and gas volumes you report on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102.
                (1) You must apply the RSS prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the requirements in § 203.46, to all oil and gas produced from the lease:
                (i) On or after December 18, 2008, if your lease is located in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep; or
                (ii) On or after May 3, 2004, if your lease is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep.

                (2) Production to which an RSV applies under §§ 203.31 through 203.33 and §§ 203.41 through 203.43 does not count toward the lease RSS. All other production, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSS.
                
                
                  Example 1:

                  If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is an original well to a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSS of 5 BCFE that would be applied to gas and oil production if your lease has not previously produced from a deep well or an ultra-deep well, or you earn an RSS of 2 BCFE of gas and oil production if your lease has previously produced from a deep well with a perforated interval from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS, as prescribed in § 203.46.
                
                
                  Example 2:
                  If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is a sidetrack that reaches a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack measured depth of 12,545 feet, and your lease has not produced gas or oil from any deep well or ultra-deep well, BSEE rounds the sidetrack measured depth to 12,500 feet and your lease earns an RSS of 2.3 BCFE of gas and oil production as prescribed in § 203.45.
                
                
                (c) The conversion from oil to gas for using the royalty suspension supplement is specified in § 203.73.
                (d) Each lease is eligible for up to two royalty suspension supplements. Therefore, the total royalty suspension supplement for a lease cannot exceed 10 BCFE.
                (1) You may not earn more than one royalty suspension supplement from a single wellbore.
                (2) If you begin drilling a certified unsuccessful well on one lease but the completion target is on a second lease, the entire royalty suspension supplement belongs to the second lease. However, if the target straddles a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the royalty suspension supplement.
                (e) If the same wellbore that earns an RSS as a certified unsuccessful well later produces from a perforated interval the top of which is 15,000 feet TVD or deeper and becomes a qualified well, it will be subject to the following conditions:
                (1) Beginning on the date production starts, you must stop applying the royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore to your lease production.
                (2) If the completion of this qualified well is on your lease or, in the case of a directional well, is on another lease, then you must subtract from the royalty suspension volume earned by that qualified well the royalty suspension supplement amounts earned by that wellbore that have already been applied either on your lease or any other lease. The difference represents the royalty suspension volume earned by the qualified well.
                (f) If the same wellbore that earned a royalty suspension supplement later has a sidetrack drilled from that wellbore, you are not required to subtract any royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore from the royalty suspension volume that may be earned by the sidetrack.
                (g) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any royalty suspension supplements under this section.
              
              
                § 203.46
                To which production do I apply the royalty suspension supplements from drilling one or two certified unsuccessful wells on my lease?
                (a) Subject to the requirements of §§ 203.40, 203.43, 203.45, 203.47, and 203.48 you must apply an RSS in § 203.45 to the earliest oil and gas production:
                (1) Occurring on and after the day you file the information under § 203.47(b),
                (2) From, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, the lease on which the certified unsuccessful well was drilled, without regard to the drilling depth of the well producing the gas or oil.

                (b) If you have a royalty suspension volume for the lease under § 203.41, you must use the royalty suspension volumes for gas produced from qualified wells on the lease before using royalty suspension supplements for gas produced from qualified wells.
                
                
                  Example to paragraph (b):
                  You have two shallow oil wells on your lease. Then you drill a certified unsuccessful well and earn a royalty suspension supplement of 5 BCFE. Thereafter, you begin production from an original well that is a qualified well that earns a royalty suspension volume of 15 BCF. You use only 2 BCFE of the royalty suspension supplement before the oil wells deplete. You must use up the 15 BCF of royalty suspension volume before you use the remaining 3 BCFE of the royalty suspension supplement for gas produced from the qualified well.
                
                

                (c) If you have no current production on which to apply the RSS allowed under § 203.45, your RSS applies to the earliest subsequent production of gas and oil from, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, your lease.
                
                (d) Unused royalty suspension supplements transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.
                (e) You may not apply the RSS allowed under § 203.45 to production from any other lease, except for production allocated to your lease from a BSEE-approved unit agreement. If your certified unsuccessful well is on a lease subject to a BSEE-approved unit agreement, the lessees of other leases in the unit may not apply any portion of the RSS for your lease to production from the other leases in the unit.
                (f) You must begin or resume paying royalties when cumulative gas and oil production from, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, your lease (excluding any gas produced from qualified wells subject to a royalty suspension volume allowed under § 203.41) reaches the applicable royalty suspension supplement. For the month in which the cumulative production reaches this royalty suspension supplement, you owe royalties on the portion of gas or oil production that exceeds the amount of the royalty suspension supplement remaining at the beginning of that month.
              
              
                § 203.47
                What administrative steps do I take to obtain and use the royalty suspension supplement?
                (a) Before you start drilling a well on your lease targeted to a reservoir at least 18,000 feet TVD SS, you must notify, in writing, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your intent to begin drilling operations and the depth of the target.
                (b) After drilling the well, you must provide the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development within 60 days after reaching the total depth in your well:
                (1) Information that allows BSEE to confirm that you drilled a certified unsuccessful well as defined under § 203.0, including:
                (i) Well log data, if your original well or sidetrack does not meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A; or
                (ii) Well log, well test, seismic, and economic data, if your well does meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A; and
                (2) Information that allows BSEE to confirm the size of the royalty suspension supplement for a sidetrack, including sidetrack measured depth and supporting documentation.
                (c) If you commenced drilling a well that otherwise meets the criteria for a certified unsuccessful well on a lease located entirely in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water on or after May 18, 2007, and finished it before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section no later than February 17, 2009.
              
              
                § 203.48
                Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?
                (a) You must pay royalties on all gas and oil production for which an RSV or an RSS otherwise would be allowed under §§ 203.40 through 203.47 for any calendar year when the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.
                
                  
                    For a lease located in water . . .
                    And issued . . .
                    The applicable threshold price is . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep,
                    before December 18, 2008,
                    $10.15 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation.
                  
                  
                    (2) Partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep,
                    after December 18, 2008,
                    $4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
                  
                  
                    (3) Entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep,
                    on any date,
                    $4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
                  
                
                (b) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar year.

                (c) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.
                (d) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV and RSS.
              
              
                § 203.49
                May I substitute the deep gas drilling provisions in this part for the deep gas royalty relief provided in my lease terms?
                (a) You may exercise an option to replace the applicable lease terms for royalty relief related to deep-well drilling with those in § 203.0 and §§ 203.40 through 203.48 if you have a lease issued with royalty relief provisions for deep-well drilling. Such leases:
                (1) Must be issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after January 1, 2001, and before April 1, 2004; and
                (2) Must be located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep.
                (b) To exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you must notify, in writing, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your decision before September 1, 2004, or 180 days after your lease is issued, whichever is later, and specify the lease and block number.
                (c) Once you exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you are subject to all the activity, timing, and administrative requirements pertaining to deep gas royalty relief as specified in §§ 203.40 through 203.48.
                (d) Exercising the option under paragraph (a) of this section is irrevocable. If you do not exercise this option, then the terms of your lease apply.
              
            
            
              Royalty Relief for End-of-Life Leases
              
                § 203.50
                Who may apply for end-of-life royalty relief?
                You may apply for royalty relief in two situations.
                (a) Your end-of-life lease (as defined in § 203.2) is an oil and gas lease and has average daily production of at least 100 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per month (as calculated in § 203.73) in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months. These 12 months should reflect the basic operation you intend to use until your resources are depleted. If you changed your operation significantly (e.g., begin re-injecting rather than recovering gas) during the qualifying months, or if you do so while we are processing your application, we may defer action on your application until you revise it to show the new circumstances.
                (b) Your end-of-life lease is other than an oil and gas lease (e.g., sulphur) and has production in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months.
              
              
                § 203.51
                How do I apply for end-of-life royalty relief?
                You must submit a complete application and the required fee to the appropriate BSEE Regional Director. Your BSEE regional office will provide specific guidance on the report formats. A complete application for relief includes:
                (a) An administrative information report (specified in § 203.83) and
                (b) A net revenue and relief justification report (specified in § 203.84).
              
              
                § 203.52
                What criteria must I meet to get relief?
                (a) To qualify for relief, you must demonstrate that the sum of royalty payments over the 12 qualifying months exceeds 75 percent of the sum of net revenues (before-royalty revenues minus allowable costs, as defined in § 203.84).
                (b) To re-qualify for relief, e.g., either applying for additional relief on top of relief already granted, or applying for relief sometime after your earlier agreement terminated, you must demonstrate that:
                (1) You have met the criterion listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and
                (2) The 12 required qualifying months of operation have occurred under the current royalty arrangement.
              
              
                § 203.53
                What relief will BSEE grant?

                (a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, we will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the relief volume amount:
                (1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume amount; and
                (2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all production greater than twice the relief volume amount.
                (b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see § 203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not exceed the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective royalty rate.
                (1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on production during the 12 qualifying months.
                (2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production for the 12 qualifying months.
              
              
                § 203.54
                How does my relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease operate if prices rise sharply?
                In those months when your current reference price rises by at least 25 percent above your base reference price, you must pay the effective royalty rate on all monthly production.
                (a) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
                (b) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas during the qualifying months; and
                (c) Your weighting factors are the proportions of your total production volume (in BOE) provided by oil and gas during the qualifying months.
              
              
                § 203.55
                Under what conditions can my end-of-life royalty relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease be ended?
                (a) If you have an end-of-life royalty relief arrangement, you may renounce it at any time. The lease rate will return to the effective rate during the qualifying period in the first full month following our receipt of your renouncement of the relief arrangement.
                (b) If you pay the effective lease rate for 12 consecutive months, we will terminate your relief. The lease rate will return to the effective rate in the first full month following this termination.
                (c) We may stipulate in the letter of approval for individual cases certain events that would cause us to terminate relief because they are inconsistent with an end-of-life situation.
              
              
                § 203.56
                Does relief transfer when a lease is assigned?
                Yes. Royalty relief is based on the lease circumstances, not ownership. It transfers upon lease assignment.
              
            
            
              Royalty Relief for Pre-Act Deep Water Leases and for Development and Expansion Projects
              
                § 203.60
                Who may apply for royalty relief on a case-by-case basis in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico or offshore of Alaska?
                You may apply for royalty relief under §§ 203.61(b) and 203.62 for an individual lease, unit or project if you:
                (a) Hold a pre-Act lease (as defined in § 203.0) that we have assigned to an authorized field (as defined in § 203.0);
                (b) Propose an expansion project (as defined in § 203.0); or
                (c) Propose a development project (as defined in § 203.0).
              
              
                § 203.61
                How do I assess my chances for getting relief?
                You may ask for a nonbinding assessment (a formal opinion on whether a field would qualify for royalty relief) before turning in your first complete application on an authorized field. This field must have a qualifying well under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A, or be on a lease that has allocated production under an approved unit agreement.
                (a) To request a nonbinding assessment, you must:
                (1) Submit a draft application in the format and detail specified in guidance from the BSEE regional office for the GOM;
                (2) Propose to drill at least one more appraisal well if you get a favorable assessment; and
                (3) Pay a fee under § 203.3.
                
                (b) You must wait at least 90 days after receiving our assessment to apply for relief under § 203.62.
                (c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application may contain more accurate information that does not support our original assessment. It will help you decide whether your proposed inputs for evaluating economic viability and your supporting data and assumptions are adequate.
              
              
                § 203.62
                How do I apply for relief?
                (a) You must send a complete application and the required fee to the BSEE Regional Director for your region.
                (b) Your application for royalty relief offshore Alaska or in deep water in the GOM must include an original and two copies (one set of digital information) of:
                (1) Administrative information report;
                (2) Economic viability and relief justification report;
                (3) G&G report;
                (4) Engineering report;
                (5) Production report; and
                (6) Cost report.
                (c) Section 203.82 explains why we are authorized to require these reports.
                (d) Sections 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89 describe what these reports must include. The BSEE regional office for your region will guide you on the format for the required reports, and we encourage you to contact this office before preparing your application for this guidance.
              
              
                § 203.63
                Does my application have to include all leases in the field?
                (a) For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application for all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of application, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and § 203.64. However, we will evaluate all acreage that may eventually become part of the authorized field. Therefore, if you have any other leases that you believe may eventually be part of the authorized field, you must submit data for these leases according to § 203.81.
                (1) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with updates of all leases in each designated field.
                (2) To avoid sharing proprietary data with other lessees on the field, you may submit your proprietary G&G report separately from the rest of your application. Your application is not complete until we receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and reasons for our determinations under § 203.67.
                (3) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not participate, that lease is ineligible for the royalty relief for the designated field.
                (b) If your application seeks only relief for a development project or an expansion project, your application does not have to include all leases in the field.
              
              
                § 203.64
                How many applications may I file on a field or a development project?
                You may file one complete application for royalty relief during the life of the field or for a development project or an expansion project designed to produce a reservoir or set of reservoirs. However, you may send another application if:
                (a) You are eligible to apply for a redetermination under § 203.74;
                (b) You apply for royalty relief for an expansion project;
                (c) You withdraw the application before we make a determination; or
                (d) You apply for end-of-life royalty relief.
              
              
                § 203.65
                How long will BSEE take to evaluate my application?
                (a) We will determine within 20 working days if your application for royalty relief is complete. If your application is incomplete, we will explain in writing what it needs. If you withdraw a complete application, you may reapply.

                (b) We will evaluate your first application on a field within 180 days, evaluate your first application on a development project or an expansion project within 150 days and evaluate a redetermination under § 203.75 within 120 days after we determine that it is complete.
                (c) We may ask to extend the review period for your application under the conditions in the following table.
                
                  
                    If . . .
                    Then we may . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) We need more records to audit sunk costs,
                    Ask to extend the 120-day or 180-day evaluation period. The extension we request will equal the number of days between when you receive our request for records and the day we receive the records.
                  
                  
                    (2) We cannot evaluate your application for a valid reason, such as missing vital information or inconsistent or inconclusive supporting data,
                    Add another 30 days. We may add more than 30 days, but only if you agree.
                  
                  
                    (3) We need more data, explanations, or revision,
                    Ask to extend the 120-day or 180-day evaluation period. The extension we request will equal the number of days between when you receive our request and the day we receive the information.
                  
                
                (d) We may change your assumptions under § 203.62 if our technical evaluation reveals others that are more appropriate. We may consult with you before a final decision and will explain any changes.
                (e) We will notify all designated lease operators within a field when royalty relief is granted.
              
              
                § 203.66
                What happens if BSEE does not act in the time allowed?
                If we do not act within the timeframes established under § 203.65, you get royalty relief according to the following table.
                
                  
                    If you apply for royalty relief for
                    And we do not decide within the time specified,
                    As long as you
                  
                  
                    (a) An authorized field,
                    You get the minimum suspension volumes specified in § 203.69,
                    Abide by §§ 203.70 and 203.76.
                  
                  
                    (b) An expansion project,
                    You get a royalty suspension for the first year of production,
                    Abide by §§ 203.70 and 203.76.
                  
                  
                    (c) A development project,
                    You get a royalty suspension for initial production for the number of months that a decision is delayed beyond the stipulated timeframes set by § 203.65, plus all the royalty suspension volume for which you qualify,
                    Abide by §§ 203.70 and 203.76.
                  
                
              
              
                § 203.67
                What economic criteria must I meet to get royalty relief on an authorized field or project?
                We will not approve applications if we determine that royalty relief cannot make the field, development project, or expansion project economically viable. Your field or project must be uneconomic while you are paying royalties and must become economic with royalty relief.
              
              
                § 203.68
                What pre-application costs will BSEE consider in determining economic viability?
                (a) We will not consider ineligible costs as set forth in § 203.89(h) in determining economic viability for purposes of royalty relief.
                (b) We will consider sunk costs according to the following table.
                
                  
                    We will . . .
                    When determining . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Include sunk costs,
                    Whether a field that includes a pre-Act lease which has not produced, other than test production, before the application or redetermination submission date needs relief to become economic.
                  
                  
                    (2) Not include sunk costs,
                    Whether an authorized field, a development project, or an expansion project can become economic with full relief (see § 203.67).
                  
                  
                    (3) Not include sunk costs,
                    How much suspension volume is necessary to make the field, a development project, or an expansion project economic (see § 203.69(c)).
                  
                  
                    (4) Include sunk costs for the project discovery well on each lease,
                    Whether a development project or an expansion project needs relief to become economic.
                  
                
              
              
                
                § 203.69
                If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I receive?
                If we approve your application, subject to certain conditions, we will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your field, development project, or expansion project. Suspension volumes include volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement, but exclude any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations of this chapter (e.g., fuel gas).
                (a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes are:
                (1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 to 400 meters of water;
                (2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and
                (3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.
                (b) For development projects, any relief we grant applies only to project wells and replaces the royalty relief, if any, with which we issued your lease.
                (c) If your project is economic given the royalty relief with which we issued your lease, we will reject the application.
                (d) If the lease has earned or may earn deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.40 through 203.49 or ultra-deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.30 through 203.36, we will take the deep gas royalty relief or ultra-deep gas royalty relief into account in determining whether further royalty relief for a development project is necessary for production to be economic.

                (e) If neither paragraph (c) nor (d) of this section apply, the minimum royalty suspension volumes are as shown in the following table:
                
                  
                    For . . .
                    The minimum royalty suspension volume is . . .
                    Plus . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) RS leases in the GOM or leases offshore Alaska,
                    A volume equal to the combined royalty suspension volumes (or the volume equivalent based on the data in your approved application for other forms of royalty suspension) with which BSEE issued the leases participating in the application that have or plan a well into a reservoir identified in the application,
                    10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which BSEE based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in the project.
                  
                  
                    (2) Leases offshore Alaska or other deep water GOM leases issued in sales after November 28, 2000,
                    A volume equal to 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which BSEE based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in the project.
                    
                  
                
                (f) If your application includes pre-Act leases in different categories of water depth, we apply the minimum royalty suspension volume for the deepest such lease then assigned to the field. We base the water depth and makeup of a field on the water-depth delineations in the “Lease Terms and Economic Conditions” map and the “Fields Directory” documents and updates in effect at the time your application is deemed complete. These publications are available from the BSEE Gulf of Mexico Regional Office.
                (g) You will get a royalty suspension volume above the minimum if we determine that you need more to make the field or development project economic.
                (h) For expansion projects, the minimum royalty suspension volume equals 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which we based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in your project plus any suspension volumes required under § 203.66. If we determine that your expansion project may be economic only with more relief, we will determine and grant you the royalty suspension volume necessary to make the project economic.
                (i) The royalty suspension volume applicable to specific leases will continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production reaches that volume. You must calculate cumulative production from all the leases in the authorized field or project that are entitled to share the royalty suspension volume.
              
              
                
                § 203.70
                What information must I provide after BSEE approves relief?
                You must submit reports to us as indicated in the following table. Sections 203.81, 203.90, and 203.91 describe what these reports must include. The BSEE Regional Office for your region will prescribe the formats.
                
                  
                    Required report
                    When due to BSEE
                    Due date extensions
                  
                  
                    (a) Fabricator's confirmation report.
                    Within 18 months after approval of relief.
                    BSEE Director may grant you an extension under § 203.79(c) for up to 6 months.
                  
                  
                    (b) Post-production report.
                    Within 120 days after the start of production that is subject to the approved royalty suspension volume.
                    With acceptable justification from you, the BSEE Regional Director for your region may extend the due date up to 30 days.
                  
                
              
              
                § 203.71
                How does BSEE allocate a field's suspension volume between my lease and other leases on my field?
                The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease terms, as prescribed in this section.
                (a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty suspension volume under §§ 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of royalties on production from all leases in the field that participate in the application until their cumulative production equals the approved volume. The following conditions also apply:
                
                  
                    If . . .
                    Then . . .
                    And . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) We assign an eligible lease to your authorized field after we approve relief,
                    We will not change your authorized field's royalty suspension volume determined under § 203.69,
                    Production from the assigned eligible lease(s) counts toward the royalty suspension volume for the authorized field, but the eligible lease will not share any remaining royalty suspension volume for the authorized field after the eligible lease has produced the volume applicable under 30 CFR 560.114.
                  
                  
                    (2) We assign a pre-Act or post-November 2000 deep water lease to your field after we approve your application,
                    We will not change your field's royalty suspension volume,
                    The assigned lease(s) may share in any remaining royalty relief by filing the short-form application specified in § 203.83 and authorized in § 203.82. An assigned RS lease also gets any portion of its royalty suspension volume remaining even after the field has produced the approved relief volume.
                  
                  
                    (3) We assign another lease that you operate to your field while we are evaluating your application,
                    In our evaluation of your authorized field, we will take into account the value of any royalty relief the added lease already has under 30 CFR 560.114 or its lease document. If we find your authorized field still needs additional royalty suspension volume, that volume will be at least the combined royalty suspension volume to which all added leases on the field are entitled, or the minimum suspension volume of the authorized field, whichever is greater,
                    (i) You toll the time period for evaluation until you modify your application to be consistent with the newly constituted field;(ii) We have an additional 60 days to review the new information; and
                      (iii) The assigned pre-Act lease or royalty suspension lease shares the royalty suspension we grant to the newly constituted field. An eligible lease does not share the royalty suspension we grant to the new field. If you do not agree to toll, we will have to reject your application due to incomplete information. Production from an assigned eligible lease counts toward the royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 for your authorized field, but you will not owe royalty on production from the eligible lease until it has produced the volume applicable under 30 CFR 560.114.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                    (4) We assign another operator's lease to your field while we are evaluating your application,
                    We will change your field's minimum suspension volume provided the assigned lease joins the application and is entitled to a larger minimum suspension volume,
                    (i) You both toll the time period for evaluation until both of you modify your application to be consistent with the new field;(ii) We have an additional 60 days to review the new information; and
                      (iii) The assigned lease(s) shares the royalty suspension we grant to the new field. If you (the original applicant) do not agree to toll, the other operator's lease retains any suspension volume it has or may share in any relief that we grant by filing the short form application specified in § 203.83 and authorized in § 203.82.
                    
                  
                  
                    (5) We reassign a well on a pre-Act, eligible, or royalty suspension lease from field A to field B,
                    The past production from the well counts toward the royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 to field B,
                    For any field based relief, the past production for that well will not count toward any royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 to field A. Moreover, past production from that well will count toward the royalty suspension volume applicable for the lease under 30 CFR 560.114 if the well is on an eligible lease or under 30 CFR 560.124 if the well is on a royalty suspension lease.
                  
                
                (b) When a project has more than one lease, the royalty suspension volume for each lease equals that lease's actual production from the project (or production allocated under an approved unit agreement) until total production for all leases in the project equals the project's approved royalty suspension volume.
                (c) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.
              
              
                § 203.72
                Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?
                Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one suspension volume under § 203.62 in two circumstances.
                (a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of § 203.67.
                (b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation criteria of § 203.67.
              
              
                § 203.73
                How do suspension volumes apply to natural gas?
                You must measure natural gas production under the royalty-suspension volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured in accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.
              
              
                § 203.74
                When will BSEE reconsider its determination?
                You may request a redetermination after we withdraw approval or after you renounce royalty relief, unless we withdraw approval due to your providing false or intentionally inaccurate information. Under certain conditions you may also request a redetermination if we deny your application or if you want your approved royalty suspension volume to change. In these instances, to be eligible for a redetermination, at least one of the following four conditions must occur.
                (a) You have significant new G&G data and you previously have not either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. “Significant” means that the new G&G data:
                (1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);

                (2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and
                
                (3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our earlier determination.
                (b) You demonstrate in your new application that the technology that most efficiently develops this field or lease was not considered or deemed feasible in the original application. Your newly proposed technology must improve the profitability, under equivalent market conditions, of the field or lease relative to the development system proposed in the prior application.
                (c) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent from your base reference price as calculated under this paragraph.
                (1) Your current reference price is a weighted-average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
                (2) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas for the full 12 calendar months preceding the date of your most recently approved application for this royalty relief; and
                (3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated with the most likely scenario (identified in §§ 203.85 and 203.88) from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
                (d) Before starting to build your development and production system, you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the most likely scenario from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
              
              
                § 203.75
                What risk do I run if I request a redetermination?
                If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application and pay the required fee, as discussed in § 203.62. We will evaluate your application under § 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.
              
              
                § 203.76
                When might BSEE withdraw or reduce the approved size of my relief?
                We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following reasons.

                (a) You change the type of development system proposed in your application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production system, or from an independent development and production system to one with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, etc.).
                (b) You do not start building the proposed development and production system within 18 months of the date we approved your application, unless the BSEE Director grants you an extension under § 203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then suspend its construction before completion, and you do not restart continuous building of the proposed system within 18 months of our approval, we will withdraw the relief we granted.
                (c) Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production development report (§ 203.70). Development costs are those expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between the application submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50 percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources anticipated in your application.

                (d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified for a redetermination under § 203.74(c), and we find out your actual development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. Development costs are those expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between your application submission date and start of production.
                (e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the post-production development report, or you provide false or intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late-payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54 on all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. You also may be subject to penalties under other provisions of law.
              
              
                § 203.77
                May I voluntarily give up relief if conditions change?
                Yes, you may voluntarily give up relief by sending a letter to that effect to the BSEE Regional office for your region.
              
              
                § 203.78
                Do I keep relief approved by BSEE under this part for my lease, unit or project if prices rise significantly?
                If prices rise above a base price threshold for light sweet crude oil or natural gas, you must pay full royalties on production otherwise subject to royalty relief approved by BSEE under §§ 203.60-203.77 for your lease, unit or project as prescribed in this section.
                (a) The following table shows the base price threshold for various types of leases, subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Note that, for post-November 2000 deepwater leases in the GOM, price thresholds apply on a lease basis, so different leases on the same development project or expansion project approved for royalty relief may have different price thresholds.
                
                  
                    For . . .
                    The base price threshold is . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Pre-Act leases in the GOM,
                    set by statute.
                  
                  
                    (2) Post-November 2000 deep water leases in the GOM or leases offshore of Alaska for which the lease or Notice of Sale set a base price threshold,
                    indicated in your original lease agreement or, if none, those in the Notice of Sale under which your lease was issued.
                  
                  
                    (3) Post-November 2000 deep water leases in the GOM or leases offshore of Alaska for which the lease or Notice of Sale did not set a base price threshold,
                    the threshold set by statute for pre-Act leases.
                  
                
                (b) An exception may occur if we determine that the price thresholds in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section mean the royalty suspension volume set under § 203.69 and in lease terms would provide inadequate encouragement to increase production or development, in which circumstance we could specify a different set of price thresholds on a case-by-case basis.
                (c) Suppose your base oil price threshold set under paragraph (a) is $28.00 per barrel, and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $28.00 per barrel, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:
                (1) Pay royalties on all oil production for the previous year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54) by March 31 of the current calendar year, and
                (2) Pay royalties on all your oil production in the current year.
                (d) Suppose your base gas price threshold set under paragraph (a) is $3.50 per million British thermal units (Btu), and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $3.50 per million Btu, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:
                (1) Pay royalties on all gas production for the previous year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54) by March 31 of the current calendar year, and
                (2) Pay royalties on all your gas production in the current year.
                (e) Production under both paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume.

                (f) You are entitled to a refund or credit, with interest, of royalties paid on any production (that counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume):
                
                (1) Of oil if the arithmetic average of the closing prices for the current calendar year is $28.00 per barrel or less, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section, and
                (2) Of gas if the arithmetic average of the closing natural gas prices for the current calendar year is $3.50 per million Btu or less, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section.
                (g) You must follow our regulations in the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, 30 CFR chapter XII, for receiving refunds or credits.
                (h) We change the prices referred to in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section periodically. For pre-Act leases, these prices change during each calendar year after 1994 by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product changed during the preceding calendar year. For post-November 2000 deepwater leases, these prices change as indicated in the lease instrument or in the Notice of Sale under which we issued the lease.
              
              
                § 203.79
                How do I appeal BSEE's decisions related to royalty relief for a deepwater lease or a development or expansion project?
                (a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can request reconsideration by sending the BSEE Director a letter within 15 days that also states your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.
                (b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty under § 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under § 203.69 are final agency actions.
                (c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in § 203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing the BSEE Director and stating your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.

                (d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702) only if you file an action within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.
              
              
                § 203.80
                When can I get royalty relief if I am not eligible for royalty relief under other sections in the subpart?
                We may grant royalty relief when it serves the statutory purposes summarized in § 203.1 and our formal relief programs, including but not limited to the applicable levels of the royalty suspension volumes and price thresholds, provide inadequate encouragement to promote development or increase production. Unless your lease lies offshore of Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. Before you may apply for royalty relief apart from our programs for end-of-life leases or for pre-Act deep water leases and development and expansion projects, we must agree that your lease or project has two or more of the following characteristics:
                (a) The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional resources mean enough to allow production for at least a year more than would be profitable without royalty relief.
                (b) Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease, their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.
                (c) A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the resources.
                (d) The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent significant change in operations).
                (e) Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.

                What supplemental reports do royalty-relief applications require?
                (a) You must send us the supplemental reports, indicated in the following table by an X, that apply to your field. Sections 203.83 through 203.91 describe these reports in detail.

                (c) With your application and post-production development report, you must submit an additional report prepared by an independent CPA that:
                (1) Assesses the accuracy of the historical financial information in your report; and
                (2) Certifies that the content and presentation of the financial data and information conform to our most recent guidelines on royalty relief. This means the data and information must:
                (i) Include only eligible costs that are incurred during the qualification months; and
                (ii) Be shown in the proper format.
                (d) You must identify the people in the CPA firm who prepared the reports referred to in paragraph (c) of this section and make them available to us to respond to questions about the historical financial information. We may also further review your records to support this information.
              
              
                § 203.82
                What is BSEE's authority to collect this information?

                The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information collection requirements in part 203 under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned OMB control number 1010-0071.
                (a) We use the information to determine whether royalty relief will result in production that wouldn't otherwise occur. We rely largely on your information to make these determinations.
                (1) Your application for royalty relief must contain enough information on finances, economics, reservoirs, G&G characteristics, production, and engineering estimates for us to determine whether:
                (i) We should grant relief under the law, and
                (ii) The requested relief will ultimately recover more resources and return a reasonable profit on project investments.
                (2) Your fabricator confirmation and post-production development reports must contain enough information for us to verify that your application reasonably represented your plans.
                (b) Applicants (respondents) are Federal OCS oil and gas lessees. Applications are required to obtain or retain a benefit. Therefore, if you apply for royalty relief, you must provide this information. We will protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and under regulations at § 203.63 and 30 CFR part 250.

                (c) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to inform you that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
                
                (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.

                § 203.83
                What is in an administrative information report?
                This report identifies the field or lease for which royalty relief is requested and must contain the following items:
                (a) The field or lease name;
                (b) The serial number of leases we have assigned to the field, names of the lease title holders of record, the lease operators, and whether any lease is part of a unit;
                (c) Well number, API number, location, and status of each well that has been drilled on the field or lease or project (not required for non-oil and gas leases);
                (d) The location of any new wells proposed under the terms of the application (not required for non-oil and gas leases);
                (e) A description of field or lease history;
                (f) Full information as to whether you will pay royalties or a share of production to anyone other than the United States, the amount you will pay, and how much you will reduce this payment if we grant relief;

                § 203.84
                What is in a net revenue and relief justification report?
                This report presents cash flow data for 12 qualifying months, using the format specified in the “Guidelines for the Application, Review, Approval, and Administration of Royalty Relief for End-of-Life Leases”, U.S. Department of the Interior, BSEE. Qualifying months for an oil and gas lease are the most recent 12 months out of the last 15 months that you produced at least 100 BOE per day on average. Qualifying months for other than oil and gas leases are the most recent 12 of the last 15 months having some production.
                (a) The cash flow table you submit must include historical data for:
                (1) Lease production subject to royalty;
                (2) Total revenues;
                (3) Royalty payments out of production;
                (4) Total allowable costs; and
                (5) Transportation and processing costs.
                (b) Do not include in your cash flow table the non-allowable costs listed at 30 CFR 1220.013 or:
                (1) OCS rental payments on the lease(s) in the application;
                (2) Damages and losses;
                (3) Taxes;
                (4) Any costs associated with exploratory activities;
                (5) Civil or criminal fines or penalties;
                (6) Fees for your royalty relief application; and
                (7) Costs associated with existing obligations (e.g., royalty overrides or other forms of payment for acquiring the lease, depreciation on previously acquired equipment or facilities).
                (c) We may, in reviewing and evaluating your application, disallow costs when you have not shown they are necessary to operate the lease, or if they are inconsistent with end-of-life operations.

                (c) Evidence of an appropriate down payment or equal action that you've started acquiring the approved system.
              
              
                § 203.91
                What is in a post-production development report?
                For each cost category in the deep water cost report, you must compare actual costs up to the date when production starts to your planned pre-production costs. If your application included more than one development scenario, you need to compare actual costs with those in your scenario of most likely development. Also, you must have this report certified by an independent CPA according to § 203.81(c).

You must move similar equipment on lower decks at least 35 feet from the point of impact where slag, sparks, or other burning materials could fall. If moving this equipment is impractical, you must protect that equipment with flame-proofed covers, shield it with metal or fire-resistant guards or curtains, or render the flammable substances inert.
                
                (b) While you weld, you must monitor all water-discharge-point sources from hydrocarbon-handling vessels. If a discharge of flammable fluids occurs, you must stop welding.
                (c) If you cannot weld in one of the designated safe-welding areas that you listed in your safe welding plan, you must meet the following requirements:
                (1) You may not begin welding until:
                (i) The welding supervisor or designated person in charge advises in writing that it is safe to weld.
                (ii) You and the designated person in charge inspect the work area and areas below it for potential fire and explosion hazards.
                (2) During welding, the person in charge must designate one or more persons as a fire watch. The fire watch must:
                (i) Have no other duties while actual welding is in progress;
                (ii) Have usable firefighting equipment;
                (iii) Remain on duty for 30 minutes after welding activities end; and
                (iv) Maintain a continuous surveillance with a portable gas detector during the welding and burning operation if welding occurs in an area not equipped with a gas detector.
                (3) You may not weld piping, containers, tanks, or other vessels that have contained a flammable substance unless you have rendered the contents inert and the designated person in charge has determined it is safe to weld. This does not apply to approved hot taps.
                (4) You may not weld within 10 feet of a wellbay unless you have shut in all producing wells in that wellbay.
                (5) You may not weld within 10 feet of a production area, unless you have shut in that production area.
                (6) You may not weld while you drill, complete, workover, or conduct wireline operations unless:
                (i) The fluids in the well (being drilled, completed, worked over, or having wireline operations conducted) are noncombustible; and
                (ii) You have precluded the entry of formation hydrocarbons into the wellbore by either mechanical means or a positive overbalance toward the formation.

              Inspections of Operations
              
                § 250.130
                Why does BSEE conduct inspections?
                BSEE will inspect OCS facilities and any vessels engaged in drilling or other downhole operations. These include facilities under jurisdiction of other Federal agencies that we inspect by agreement. We conduct these inspections:
                (a) To verify that you are conducting operations according to the Act, the regulations, the lease, right-of-way, the BOEM-approved Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plans; or right-of-use and easement, and other applicable laws and regulations; and
                (b) To determine whether equipment designed to prevent or ameliorate blowouts, fires, spillages, or other major accidents has been installed and is operating properly according to the requirements of this part.
              
              
                § 250.131
                Will BSEE notify me before conducting an inspection?
                BSEE conducts both scheduled and unscheduled inspections.
              
              
                § 250.132
                What must I do when BSEE conducts an inspection?
                (a) When BSEE conducts an inspection, you must provide:
                (1) Access to all platforms, artificial islands, and other installations on your leases or associated with your lease, right-of-use and easement, or right-of-way; and
                (2) Helicopter landing sites and refueling facilities for any helicopters we use to regulate offshore operations.
                (b) You must make the following available for us to inspect:
                (1) The area covered under a lease, right-of-use and easement, right-of-way, or permit;
                (2) All improvements, structures, and fixtures on these areas; and
                (3) All records of design, construction, operation, maintenance, repairs, or investigations on or related to the area.
              
              
                § 250.133
                Will BSEE reimburse me for my expenses related to inspections?
                Upon request, BSEE will reimburse you for food, quarters, and transportation that you provide for BSEE representatives while they inspect lease facilities and operations. You must send us your reimbursement request within 90 days of the inspection.

                § 250.135
                What will BSEE do if my operating performance is unacceptable?
                BSEE will determine if your operating performance is unacceptable. BSEE will refer a determination of unacceptable performance to BOEM, who may disapprove or revoke your designation as operator on a single facility or multiple facilities. We will give you adequate notice and opportunity for a review by BSEE officials before making a determination that your operating performance is unacceptable.
              
              
                § 250.136
                How will BSEE determine if my operating performance is unacceptable?
                In determining if your operating performance is unacceptable, BSEE will consider, individually or collectively:
                (a) Accidents and their nature;
                (b) Pollution events, environmental damages and their nature;
                (c) Incidents of noncompliance;
                (d) Civil penalties;
                (e) Failure to adhere to OCS lease obligations; or
                (f) Any other relevant factors.

                § 250.140
                When will I receive an oral approval?

                You may use alternate procedures or equipment after receiving approval as described in this section.
                (a) Any alternate procedures or equipment that you propose to use must provide a level of safety and environmental protection that equals or surpasses current BSEE requirements.
                (b) You must receive the District Manager's or Regional Supervisor's written approval before you can use alternate procedures or equipment.
                (c) To receive approval, you must either submit information or give an oral presentation to the appropriate Regional Supervisor. Your presentation must describe the site-specific application(s), performance characteristics, and safety features of the proposed procedure or equipment.

                § 250.145
                How do I designate an agent or a local agent?
                (a) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional Supervisor's approval, or the Regional Director may require you to designate an agent empowered to fulfill your obligations under the Act, the lease, or the regulations in this part.
                (b) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional Supervisor's approval a local agent empowered to receive notices and submit requests, applications, notices, or supplemental information.
              
              
                § 250.146
                Who is responsible for fulfilling leasehold obligations?
                (a) When you are not the sole lessee, you and your co-lessee(s) are jointly and severally responsible for fulfilling your obligations under the provisions of 30 CFR parts 250 through 282 and 30 CFR parts 550 through 582 unless otherwise provided in these regulations.
                (b) If your designated operator fails to fulfill any of your obligations under 30 CFR parts 250 through 282 and 30 CFR parts 550 through 582, the Regional Supervisor may require you or any or all of your co-lessees to fulfill those obligations or other operational obligations under the Act, the lease, or the regulations.
                (c) Whenever the regulations in 30 CFR parts 250 through 282 and 30 CFR parts 550 through 582 require the lessee to meet a requirement or perform an action, the lessee, operator (if one has been designated), and the person actually performing the activity to which the requirement applies are jointly and severally responsible for complying with the regulation.
              
            
            
              Naming and Identifying Facilities and Wells (Does Not Include MODUs)
              
                § 250.150
                How do I name facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico Region?
                (a) Assign each facility a letter designation except for those types of facilities identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, A, B, CA, or CB.

                (1) After a facility is installed, rename each predrilled well that was assigned only a number and was suspended temporarily at the mudline or at the surface. Use a letter and number designation. The letter used must be the same as that of the production facility, and the number used must correspond to the order in which the well was completed, not necessarily the number assigned when it was drilled. For example, the first well completed for production on Facility A would be renamed Well A-1, the second would be Well A-2, and so on; and
                (2) When you have more than one facility on a block, each facility installed, and not bridge-connected to another facility, must be named using a different letter in sequential order. For example, EC 222A, EC 222B, EC 222C.
                (3) When you have more than one facility on multiple blocks in a local area being co-developed, each facility installed and not connected with a walkway to another facility should be named using a different letter in sequential order with the block number corresponding to the block on which the platform is located. For example, EC 221A, EC 222B, and EC 223C.
                (b) In naming multiple well caissons, you must assign a letter designation.
                (c) In naming single well caissons, you must use certain criteria as follows:
                (1) For single well caissons not attached to a facility with a walkway, use the well designation. For example, Well No. 1;
                (2) For single well caissons attached to a facility with a walkway, use the same designation as the facility. For example, rename Well No.10 as A-10; and
                (3) For single well caissons with production equipment, use a letter designation for the facility name and a letter plus number designation for the well. For example, the Well No. 1 caisson would be designated as Facility A, and the well would be Well A-1.
              
              
                § 250.151
                How do I name facilities in the Pacific Region?

                § 250.173
                When may the Regional Supervisor direct an SOO or SOP?
                The Regional Supervisor may direct a suspension when:
                (a) You failed to comply with an applicable law, regulation, order, or provision of a lease or permit; or
                (b) The suspension is in the interest of National security or defense.
              
              
                § 250.174
                When may the Regional Supervisor grant or direct an SOP?
                The Regional Supervisor may grant or direct an SOP when the suspension is in the National interest, and it is necessary because the suspension will meet one of the following criteria:
                (a) It will allow you to properly develop a lease, including time to construct and install production facilities;
                (b) It will allow you time to obtain adequate transportation facilities;
                (c) It will allow you time to enter a sales contract for oil, gas, or sulphur. You must show that you are making an effort to enter into the contract(s); or

                § 250.180
                What am I required to do to keep my lease term in effect?
                (a) If your lease is in its primary term:
                (1) You must submit a report to the District Manager according to paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section whenever production begins initially, whenever production ceases during the last year of the primary term, and whenever production resumes during the last year of the primary term.

                (2) Your lease expires at the end of its primary term unless you are conducting operations on your lease (see 30 CFR part 556). For purposes of this section, the term operations means, drilling, well-reworking, or production in paying quantities. The objective of the drilling or well-reworking must be to establish production in paying quantities on the lease.
                (b) If you stop conducting operations during the last year of your primary lease term, your lease will expire unless you either resume operations or receive an SOO or an SOP from the Regional Supervisor under § 250.172, § 250.173, § 250.174, or § 250.175 before the end of the year after you stop operations.
                (c) If you extend your lease term under paragraph (b) of this section, you must pay rental or minimum royalty, as appropriate, for each year or part of the year during which your lease continues in force beyond the end of the primary lease term.

                (d) If you stop conducting operations on a lease that has continued beyond its primary term, your lease will expire unless you resume operations or receive an SOO or an SOP from the Regional Supervisor under § 250.172, § 250.173, § 250.174, or § 250.175 before the end of the year after you stop operations.
                (e) You may ask the Regional Supervisor to allow you more than a year to resume operations on a lease continued beyond its primary term when operating conditions warrant. The request must be in writing and explain the operating conditions that warrant a longer period. In allowing additional time, the Regional Supervisor must determine that the longer period is in the National interest, and it conserves resources, prevents waste, or protects correlative rights.
                (f) When you begin conducting operations on a lease that has continued beyond its primary term, you must immediately notify the District Manager either orally or by fax or e-mail and follow up with a written report according to paragraph (g) of this section.
                (g) If your lease is continued beyond its primary term, you must submit a report to the District Manager under paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section whenever production begins initially, whenever production ceases, whenever production resumes before the end of the 1-year period after having ceased, or whenever drilling or well-reworking operations begin before the end of the 1-year period.
                (h) The reports required by paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section must contain:
                (1) Name of lessee or operator;
                (2) The well number, lease number, area, and block;
                (3) As appropriate, the unit agreement name and number; and
                (4) A description of the operation and pertinent dates.
                (i) You must submit the reports required by paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section within the following timeframes:
                (1) Initialization of production—within 5 days of initial production.
                (2) Cessation of production—within 15 days after the first full month of zero production.
                (3) Resumption of production—within 5 days of resuming production after ceasing production under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
                (4) Drilling or well reworking operations—within 5 days of beginning and completing the leaseholding operations.
                (j) For leases continued beyond the primary term, you must immediately report to the District Manager if operations do not begin before the end of the 1-year period.

                (a) You must report the following incidents to the District Manager immediately via oral communication, and provide a written follow-up report (hard copy or electronically transmitted) within 15 calendar days after the incident:
                (1) All fatalities.
                (2) All injuries that require the evacuation of the injured person(s) from the facility to shore or to another offshore facility.
                (3) All losses of well control. “Loss of well control” means:
                (i) Uncontrolled flow of formation or other fluids. The flow may be to an exposed formation (an underground blowout) or at the surface (a surface blowout);
                (ii) Flow through a diverter; or
                (iii) Uncontrolled flow resulting from a failure of surface equipment or procedures.
                (4) All fires and explosions.
                (5) All reportable releases of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas, as defined in § 250.490(l).
                (6) All collisions that result in property or equipment damage greater than $25,000. “Collision” means the act of a moving vessel (including an aircraft) striking another vessel, or striking a stationary vessel or object (e.g., a boat striking a drilling rig or platform). “Property or equipment damage” means the cost of labor and material to restore all affected items to their condition before the damage, including, but not limited to, the OCS facility, a vessel, helicopter, or equipment. It does not include the cost of salvage, cleaning, gas-freeing, dry docking, or demurrage.
                (7) All incidents involving structural damage to an OCS facility. “Structural damage” means damage severe enough so that operations on the facility cannot continue until repairs are made.
                (8) All incidents involving crane or personnel/material handling operations.
                (9) All incidents that damage or disable safety systems or equipment (including firefighting systems).

              Deepwater Operations Plan (DWOP)
              
                § 250.286
                What is a DWOP?
                (a) A DWOP is a plan that provides sufficient information for BSEE to review a deepwater development project, and any other project that uses non-conventional production or completion technology, from a total system approach. The DWOP does not replace, but supplements other submittals required by the regulations such as BOEM Exploration Plans, Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations Coordination Documents. BSEE will use the information in your DWOP to determine whether the project will be developed in an acceptable manner, particularly with respect to operational safety and environmental protection issues involved with non-conventional production or completion technology.
                (b) The DWOP process consists of two parts: a Conceptual Plan and the DWOP. Section 250.289 prescribes what the Conceptual Plan must contain, and § 250.292 prescribes what the DWOP must contain.
              
              
                § 250.287
                For what development projects must I submit a DWOP?
                You must submit a DWOP for each development project in which you will use non-conventional production or completion technology, regardless of water depth. If you are unsure whether BSEE considers the technology of your project non-conventional, you must contact the Regional Supervisor for guidance.
              
              
                § 250.288
                When and how must I submit the Conceptual Plan?
                You must submit four copies, or one hard copy and one electronic version, of the Conceptual Plan to the Regional Director after you have decided on the general concept(s) for development and before you begin engineering design of the well safety control system or subsea production systems to be used after well completion.
              
              
                
                § 250.289
                What must the Conceptual Plan contain?
                In the Conceptual Plan, you must explain the general design basis and philosophy that you will use to develop the field. You must include the following information:
                (a) An overview of the development concept(s);
                (b) A well location plat;
                (c) The system control type (i.e., direct hydraulic or electro-hydraulic); and
                (d) The distance from each of the wells to the host platform.
              
              
                § 250.290
                What operations require approval of the Conceptual Plan?
                You may not complete any production well or install the subsea wellhead and well safety control system (often called the tree) before BSEE has approved the Conceptual Plan.
              
              
                § 250.291
                When and how must I submit the DWOP?
                You must submit four copies, or one hard copy and one electronic version, of the DWOP to the Regional Director after you have substantially completed safety system design and before you begin to procure or fabricate the safety and operational systems (other than the tree), production platforms, pipelines, or other parts of the production system.
              
              
                § 250.292

            Subpart C—Pollution Prevention and Control
            
              § 250.300
              Pollution prevention.
              (a) During the exploration, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas or sulphur, the lessee shall take measures to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of the ocean.

              (1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the satisfaction of the District Manager shall be at the expense of the lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to modification when directed by the District Manager.
              
              (2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, State, and local governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any responsibility provided for by law.
              (b)(1) The District Manager may restrict the rate of drilling fluid discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The District Manager may also restrict the use of components that could cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling mud system without prior approval of the District Manager. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all petroleum-based mud to prevent its discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all water-based mud from operations after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent its discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:
              (i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;
              (ii) The extent to which discharged mud may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or
              (iii) The extent to which discharged mud may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.
              (2) You must obtain approval from the District Manager of the method you plan to use to dispose of drill cuttings, sand, and other well solids. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all cuttings from operations that utilize petroleum-based mud to prevent their discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all cuttings from operations that utilize water-based mud after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent their discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:
              (i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;
              (ii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or
              (iii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.
              (3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken immediately.
              (4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or repaired.

              (5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.
              
              (6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other materials into offshore waters is prohibited.
              (c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or configuration that they are likely to snag or damage fishing devices shall be handled and marked as follows:
              (1) All loose material, small tools, and other small objects shall be kept in a suitable storage area or a marked container when not in use and in a marked container before transport over offshore waters;
              (2) All cable, chain, or wire segments shall be recovered after use and securely stored until suitable disposal is accomplished;
              (3) Skid-mounted equipment, portable containers, spools or reels, and drums shall be marked with the owner's name prior to use or transport over offshore waters; and
              (4) All markings must clearly identify the owner and must be durable enough to resist the effects of the environmental conditions to which they may be exposed.
              (d) Any of the items described in paragraph (c) of this section that are lost overboard shall be recorded on the facility's daily operations report, as appropriate, and reported to the District Manager.

              Casing and Cementing Requirements
              
                § 250.420
                What well casing and cementing requirements must I meet?
                You must case and cement all wells. Your casing and cementing programs must meet the applicable requirements of this subpart and of subpart G of this part.
                (a) Casing and cementing program requirements. Your casing and cementing programs must:
                (1) Properly control formation pressures and fluids;
                (2) Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore into offshore waters;
                (3) Prevent communication between separate hydrocarbon-bearing strata;
                (4) Protect freshwater aquifers from contamination;
                (5) Support unconsolidated sediments;
                (6) Provide adequate centralization to ensure proper cementation; and

                (7)(i) Include a certification signed by a registered professional engineer that the casing and cementing design is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended under expected wellbore conditions, and is sufficient to satisfy the tests and requirements of this section and § 250.423. Submit this certification with your APD (Form BSEE-0123).
                
                (ii) You must have the registered professional engineer involved in the casing and cementing design process.
                (iii) The registered professional engineer must be registered in a state of the United States and have sufficient expertise and experience to perform the certification.
                (b) Casing requirements. (1) You must design casing (including liners) to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof.
                (2) The casing design must include safety measures that ensure well control during drilling and safe operations during the life of the well.
                (3) On all wells that use subsea BOP stacks, you must include two independent barriers, including one mechanical barrier, in each annular flow path (examples of barriers include, but are not limited to, primary cement job and seal assembly). For the final casing string (or liner if it is your final string), you must install one mechanical barrier in addition to cement to prevent flow in the event of a failure in the cement. A dual float valve, by itself, is not considered a mechanical barrier. These barriers cannot be modified prior to or during completion or abandonment operations. The BSEE District Manager may approve alternative options under § 250.141. You must submit documentation of this installation to BSEE in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).
                (4) If you need to substitute a different size, grade, or weight of casing than what was approved in your APD, you must contact the District Manager for approval prior to installing the casing.
                (c) Cementing requirements. (1) You must design and conduct your cementing jobs so that cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting times ensure that the cement placed behind the bottom 500 feet of casing attains a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling out the casing or before commencing completion operations. (If a liner is used refer to § 250.421(f)).
                (2) You must use a weighted fluid during displacement to maintain an overbalanced hydrostatic pressure during the cement setting time, except when cementing casings or liners in riserless hole sections.

                    If you drilled a portion of this hole, you must use enough cement to fill the annular space back to the mudline.
                  
                  
                    
                    (b) Conductor
                    Design casing and select setting depths based on relevant engineering and geologic factors. These factors include the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depthsSet casing immediately before drilling into formations known to contain oil or gas. If you encounter oil or gas or unexpected formation pressure before the planned casing point, you must set casing immediately and set it above the encountered zone
                    
                    Use enough cement to fill the calculated annular space back to the mudline.Verify annular fill by observing cement returns. If you cannot observe cement returns, use additional cement to ensure fill-back to the mudline.
                      For drilling on an artificial island or when using a well cellar, you must discuss the cement fill level with the District Manager.
                    
                  
                  
                    (c) Surface
                    Design casing and select setting depths based on relevant engineering and geologic factors. These factors include the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths
                    Use enough cement to fill the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the conductor casing.When geologic conditions such as near-surface fractures and faulting exist, you must use enough cement to fill the calculated annular space to the mudline.
                    
                  
                  
                    (d) Intermediate
                    Design casing and select setting depth based on anticipated or encountered geologic characteristics or wellbore conditions
                    Use enough cement to cover and isolate all hydrocarbon-bearing zones and isolate abnormal pressure intervals from normal pressure intervals in the well.As a minimum, you must cement the annular space 500 feet above the casing shoe and 500 feet above each zone to be isolated.

                      You may not use a liner as conductor casing
                      A subsea well casing string whose top is above the mudline and that has been cemented back to the mudline will not be considered a liner
                    
                    Same as cementing requirements for specific casing types. For example, a liner used as intermediate casing must be cemented according to the cementing requirements for intermediate casing. If you have a liner lap and are unable to cement 500 feet above the previous shoe, as provided by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, you must submit and receive approval from the District Manager on a case-by-case basis.

                (a) After cementing surface, intermediate, or production casing (or liners), you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 12 hours. For conductor casing, you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 8 hours. One acceptable method of holding cement under pressure is to use float valves to hold the cement in place.
                (b) If you plan to nipple down your diverter or BOP stack during the 8- or 12-hour waiting time, you must determine, before nippling down, when it will be safe to do so. You must base your determination on a knowledge of formation conditions, cement composition, effects of nippling down, presence of potential drilling hazards, well conditions during drilling, cementing, and post cementing, as well as past experience.
              
              
                § 250.423
                What are the requirements for casing and liner installation?
                You must ensure proper installation of casing in the subsea wellhead or liner in the liner hanger.
                (a) You must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down mechanisms are engaged upon successfully installing and cementing the casing string. If there is an indication of an inadequate cement job, you must comply with § 250.428(c).
                (b) If you run a liner that has a latching mechanism or lock down mechanism, you must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down mechanisms are engaged upon successfully installing and cementing the liner. If there is an indication of an inadequate cement job, you must comply with § 250.428(c).
                (c) You must perform a pressure test on the casing seal assembly to ensure proper installation of casing or liner. You must perform this test for the intermediate and production casing strings or liners.
                (1) You must submit for approval with your APD, test procedures and criteria for a successful test.
                (2) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.

                What are the requirements for pressure integrity tests?
                You must conduct a pressure integrity test below the surface casing or liner and all intermediate casings or liners. The District Manager may require you to run a pressure-integrity test at the conductor casing shoe if warranted by local geologic conditions or the planned casing setting depth. You must conduct each pressure integrity test after drilling at least 10 feet but no more than 50 feet of new hole below the casing shoe. You must test to either the formation leak-off pressure or to an equivalent drilling fluid weight if identified in an approved APD.
                (a) You must use the pressure integrity test and related hole-behavior observations, such as pore-pressure test results, gas-cut drilling fluid, and well kicks to adjust the drilling fluid program and the setting depth of the next casing string. You must record all test results and hole-behavior observations made during the course of drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure in the driller's report.
                (b) While drilling, you must maintain the safe drilling margins identified in § 250.414. When you cannot maintain the safe margins, you must suspend drilling operations and remedy the situation.

                When must I install a diverter system?
                You must install a diverter system before you drill a conductor or surface hole. The diverter system consists of a diverter sealing element, diverter lines, and control systems. You must design, install, use, maintain, and test the diverter system to ensure proper diversion of gases, water, drilling fluid, and other materials away from facilities and personnel.
              
              
                § 250.431
                What are the diverter design and installation requirements?
                You must design and install your diverter system to:
                (a) Use diverter spool outlets and diverter lines that have a nominal diameter of at least 10 inches for surface wellhead configurations and at least 12 inches for floating drilling operations;
                (b) Use dual diverter lines arranged to provide for downwind diversion capability;
                (c) Use at least two diverter control stations. One station must be on the drilling floor. The other station must be in a readily accessible location away from the drilling floor;
                (d) Use only remote-controlled valves in the diverter lines. All valves in the diverter system must be full-opening. You may not install manual or butterfly valves in any part of the diverter system;
                (e) Minimize the number of turns (only one 90-degree turn allowed for each line for bottom-founded drilling units) in the diverter lines, maximize the radius of curvature of turns, and target all right angles and sharp turns;
                (f) Anchor and support the entire diverter system to prevent whipping and vibration; and
                (g) Protect all diverter-control instruments and lines from possible damage by thrown or falling objects.
              
              
                § 250.432
                How do I obtain a departure to diverter design and installation requirements?
                The table below describes possible departures from the diverter requirements and the conditions required for each departure. To obtain one of these departures, you must have discussed the departure in your APD and received approval from the District Manager.
                
                  
                    If you want a departure to:

                    (a) Use flexible hose for diverter lines instead of rigid pipe,
                    Use flexible hose that has integral end couplings.
                  
                  
                    (b) Use only one spool outlet for your diverter system,
                    (1) Have branch lines that meet the minimum internal diameter requirements; and (2) Provide downwind diversion capability.
                  
                  
                    (c) Use a spool with an outlet with an internal diameter of less than 10 inches on a surface wellhead,
                    Use a spool that has dual outlets with an internal diameter of at least 8 inches.
                  
                  
                    (d) Use a single diverter line for floating drilling operations on a dynamically positioned drillship,
                    Maintain an appropriate vessel heading to provide for downwind diversion.
                  
                
              
              
                
                § 250.433
                What are the diverter actuation and testing requirements?
                When you install the diverter system, you must actuate the diverter sealing element, diverter valves, and diverter-control systems and control stations. You must also flow-test the vent lines.
                (a) For drilling operations with a surface wellhead configuration, you must actuate the diverter system at least once every 24-hour period after the initial test. After you have nippled up on conductor casing, you must pressure-test the diverter-sealing element and diverter valves to a minimum of 200 psi. While the diverter is installed, you must conduct subsequent pressure tests within 7 days after the previous test.
                (b) For floating drilling operations with a subsea BOP stack, you must actuate the diverter system within 7 days after the previous actuation.
                (c) You must alternate actuations and tests between control stations.

              Drilling Fluid Requirements
              
                § 250.455
                What are the general requirements for a drilling fluid program?
                You must design and implement your drilling fluid program to prevent the loss of well control. This program must address drilling fluid safe practices, testing and monitoring equipment, drilling fluid quantities, and drilling fluid-handling areas.
              
              
                
                § 250.456
                What safe practices must the drilling fluid program follow?
                Your drilling fluid program must include the following safe practices:
                (a) Before starting out of the hole with drill pipe, you must properly condition the drilling fluid. You must circulate a volume of drilling fluid equal to the annular volume with the drill pipe just off-bottom. You may omit this practice if documentation in the driller's report shows:
                (1) No indication of formation fluid influx before starting to pull the drill pipe from the hole;
                (2) The weight of returning drilling fluid is within 0.2 pounds per gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot) of the drilling fluid entering the hole; and
                (3) Other drilling fluid properties are within the limits established by the program approved in the APD.
                (b) Record each time you circulate drilling fluid in the hole in the driller's report;
                (c) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, you must fill the annulus with drilling fluid before the hydrostatic pressure decreases by 75 psi, or every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower decrease in hydrostatic pressure. You must calculate the number of stands of drill pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must fill the hole. You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid volume needed to fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near the driller's station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device to measure the drilling fluid required to fill the hole;
                (d) You must run and pull drill pipe and downhole tools at controlled rates so you do not swab or surge the well;
                (e) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation fluids, you must take appropriate measures to control the well. You must circulate and condition the well, on or near-bottom, unless well or drilling-fluid conditions prevent running the drill pipe back to the bottom;
                (f) You must calculate and post near the driller's console the maximum pressures that you may safely contain under a shut-in BOP for each casing string. The pressures posted must consider the surface pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or casing test as approved by the District Manager). As a minimum, you must post the following two pressures:
                (1) The surface pressure at which the shoe would break down. This calculation must consider the current drilling fluid weight in the hole; and
                (2) The lesser of the BOP's rated working pressure or 70 percent of casing-burst pressure (or casing test otherwise approved by the District Manager);
                (g) You must install an operable drilling fluid-gas separator and degasser before you begin drilling operations. You must maintain this equipment throughout the drilling of the well;
                (h) Before pulling drill-stem test tools from the hole, you must circulate or reverse-circulate the test fluids in the hole. If circulating out test fluids is not feasible, you may bullhead test fluids out of the drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate kill weight fluid;
                (i) When circulating, you must test the drilling fluid at least once each tour, or more frequently if conditions warrant. Your tests must conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other tests the District Manager requires for monitoring and maintaining drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and for kick detection. You must record the results of these tests in the drilling fluid report; and
                (j) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones are present or may be present, you must control drilling fluid temperatures to drill safely through those zones.

                § 250.457
                What equipment is required to monitor drilling fluids?

                Once you establish drilling fluid returns, you must install and maintain the following drilling fluid-system monitoring equipment throughout subsequent drilling operations. This equipment must have the following indicators on the rig floor:
                (a) Pit level indicator to determine drilling fluid-pit volume gains and losses. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device;
                (b) Volume measuring device to accurately determine drilling fluid volumes required to fill the hole on trips;
                (c) Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and
                (d) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging compartment, you must continually man the equipment and have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.
              
              
                § 250.458
                What quantities of drilling fluids are required?
                (a) You must use, maintain, and replenish quantities of drilling fluid and drilling fluid materials at the drill site as necessary to ensure well control. You must determine those quantities based on known or anticipated drilling conditions, rig storage capacity, weather conditions, and estimated time for delivery.
                (b) You must record the daily inventories of drilling fluid and drilling fluid materials, including weight materials and additives in the drilling fluid report.
                (c) If you do not have sufficient quantities of drilling fluid and drilling fluid material to maintain well control, you must suspend drilling operations.
              
              
                § 250.459
                What are the safety requirements for drilling fluid-handling areas?
                You must classify drilling fluid-handling areas according to API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class 1, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). In areas where dangerous concentrations of combustible gas may accumulate, you must install and maintain a ventilation system and gas monitors. Drilling fluid-handling areas must have the following safety equipment:
                (a) A ventilation system capable of replacing the air once every 5 minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of air-volume flow per minute, per square foot of area, whichever is greater. In addition:
                (1) If natural means provide adequate ventilation, then a mechanical ventilation system is not necessary;
                (2) If a mechanical system does not run continuously, then it must activate when gas detectors indicate the presence of 1 percent or more of combustible gas by volume; and
                (3) If discharges from a mechanical ventilation system may be hazardous, then you must maintain the drilling fluid-handling area at a negative pressure. You must protect the negative pressure area by using at least one of the following: a pressure-sensitive alarm, open-door alarms on each access to the area, automatic door-closing devices, air locks, or other devices approved by the District Manager;
                (b) Gas detectors and alarms except in open areas where adequate ventilation is provided by natural means. You must test and recalibrate gas detectors quarterly. No more than 90 days may elapse between tests;
                (c) Explosion-proof or pressurized electrical equipment to prevent the ignition of explosive gases. Where you use air for pressuring equipment, you must locate the air intake outside of and as far as practicable from hazardous areas; and
                (d) Alarms that activate when the mechanical ventilation system fails.

                § 250.460
                What are the requirements for conducting a well test?
                (a) If you intend to conduct a well test, you must include your projected plans for the test with your APD (form BSEE-0123) or in an Application for Permit to Modify (APM) (form BSEE-0124). Your plans must include at least the following information:
                (1) Estimated flowing and shut-in tubing pressures;
                (2) Estimated flow rates and cumulative volumes;
                (3) Time duration of flow, buildup, and drawdown periods;
                (4) Description and rating of surface and subsurface test equipment;
                (5) Schematic drawing, showing the layout of test equipment;
                (6) Description of safety equipment, including gas detectors and fire-fighting equipment;
                (7) Proposed methods to handle or transport produced fluids; and
                (8) Description of the test procedures.
                (b) You must give the District Manager at least 24-hours notice before starting a well test.
              
              
                § 250.461
                What are the requirements for directional and inclination surveys?
                For this subpart, BSEE classifies a well as vertical if the calculated average of inclination readings does not exceed 3 degrees from the vertical.
                (a) Survey requirements for a vertical well. (1) You must conduct inclination surveys on each vertical well and record the results. Survey intervals may not exceed 1,000 feet during the normal course of drilling;
                (2) You must also conduct a directional survey that provides both inclination and azimuth, and digitally record the results in electronic format:
                (i) Within 500 feet of setting surface or intermediate casing;
                (ii) Within 500 feet of setting any liner; and
                (iii) When you reach total depth.
                (b) Survey requirements for directional well. You must conduct directional surveys on each directional well and digitally record the results. Surveys must give both inclination and azimuth at intervals not to exceed 500 feet during the normal course of drilling. Intervals during angle-changing portions of the hole may not exceed 100 feet.
                (c) Measurement while drilling. You may use measurement-while-drilling technology if it meets the requirements of this section.
                (d) Composite survey requirements. (1) Your composite directional survey must show the interval from the bottom of the conductor casing to total depth. In the absence of conductor casing, the survey must show the interval from the bottom of the drive or structural casing to total depth; and
                (2) You must correct all surveys to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north after making the magnetic-to-true-north correction. Surveys must show the magnetic and grid corrections used and include a listing of the directionally computed inclinations and azimuths.
                (e) If you drill within 500 feet of an adjacent lease, the Regional Supervisor may require you to furnish a copy of the well's directional survey to the affected leaseholder. This could occur when the adjoining leaseholder requests a copy of the survey for the protection of correlative rights.

                (i) Scavengers. You must have scavengers for control of H2S available on the facility. When H2S is detected, you must add scavengers as needed. You must suspend drilling until the scavenger is circulated throughout the system.
                (ii) Control pH. You must add additives for the control of pH to water-base well-control fluids in sufficient quantities to maintain pH of at least 10.0.
                (iii) Corrosion inhibitors. You must add additives to the well-control fluid system as needed for the control of corrosion.
                (5) You must degas well-control fluids containing H2S at the optimum location for the particular facility. You must collect the gases removed and burn them in a closed flare system conforming to paragraph (q)(6) of this section.
                (n) What must I do in the event of a kick? In the event of a kick, you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:
                (1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and pumping the fluids back into the formation.

                (2) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP system, and related equipment). The disposal of H2S and other gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator equipment depending on volume, pressure and concentration of H2S. The equipment must be designed to recover well-control fluids and burn the gases separated from the well-control fluid. The well-control fluid must be treated to neutralize H2S and restore and maintain the proper quality.
                (o) Well testing in a zone known to contain H
                  2
                  S. When testing a well in a zone with H2S present, you must do all of the following:

                (1) Before starting a well test, conduct safety meetings for all personnel who will be on the facility during the test. At the meetings, emphasize the use of protective-breathing equipment, first-aid procedures, and the Contingency Plan. Only competent personnel who are trained and are knowledgeable of the hazardous effects of H2S must be engaged in these tests.

                (2) Perform well testing with the minimum number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the rig floor and with the appropriate test equipment to safely and adequately perform the test. During the test, you must continuously monitor H2S levels.

                (3) Not burn produced gases except through a flare which meets the requirements of paragraph (q)(6) of this section. Before flaring gas containing H2S, you must activate SO2 monitoring equipment in accordance with paragraph (j)(11) of this section. If you detect SO2 in excess of 2 ppm, you must implement the personnel protective measures in your H2S Contingency Plan, required by paragraph (f) of this section. You must also follow the requirements of § 250.1164. You must pipe gases from stored test fluids into the flare outlet and burn them.

                (4) Use downhole test tools and wellhead equipment suitable for H2S service.
                (5) Use tubulars suitable for H2S service. You must not use drill pipe for well testing without the prior approval of the District Manager. Water cushions must be thoroughly inhibited in order to prevent H2S attack on metals. You must flush the test string fluid treated for this purpose after completion of the test.

                (6) Use surface test units and related equipment that is designed for H2S service.
                (p) Metallurgical properties of equipment. When operating in a zone with H2S present, you must use equipment that is constructed of materials with metallurgical properties that resist or prevent sulfide stress cracking (also known as hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, or H2S embrittlement), chloride-stress cracking, hydrogen-induced cracking, and other failure modes. You must do all of the following:

                (1) Use tubulars and other equipment, casing, tubing, drill pipe, couplings, flanges, and related equipment that is designed for H2S service.

                (2) Use BOP system components, wellhead, pressure-control equipment, and related equipment exposed to H2S-bearing fluids in conformance with NACE Standard MR0175-03 (as specified in § 250.198).

                (3) Use temporary downhole well-security devices such as retrievable packers and bridge plugs that are designed for H2S service.
                (4) When producing in zones bearing H2S, use equipment constructed of materials capable of resisting or preventing sulfide stress cracking.
                (5) Keep the use of welding to a minimum during the installation or modification of a production facility. Welding must be done in a manner that ensures resistance to sulfide stress cracking.
                (q) General requirements when operating in an H
                  2
                  S zone: (1) Coring operations. When you conduct coring operations in H2S-bearing zones, all personnel in the working area must wear protective-breathing equipment at least 10 stands in advance of retrieving the core barrel. Cores to be transported must be sealed and marked for the presence of H2S.
                (2) Logging operations. You must treat and condition well-control fluid in use for logging operations to minimize the effects of H2S on the logging equipment.
                (3) Stripping operations. Personnel must monitor displaced well-control fluid returns and wear protective-breathing equipment in the working area when the atmospheric concentration of H2S reaches 20 ppm or if the well is under pressure.
                (4) Gas-cut well-control fluid or well kick from H
                  2
                  S-bearing zone. If you decide to circulate out a kick, personnel in the working area during bottoms-up and extended-kill operations must wear protective-breathing equipment.
                (5) Drill- and workover-string design and precautions. Drill- and workover-strings must be designed consistent with the anticipated depth, conditions of the hole, and reservoir environment to be encountered. You must minimize exposure of the drill- or workover-string to high stresses as much as practical and consistent with well conditions. Proper handling techniques must be taken to minimize notching and stress concentrations. Precautions must be taken to minimize stresses caused by doglegs, improper stiffness ratios, improper torque, whip, abrasive wear on tool joints, and joint imbalance.
                (6) Flare system. The flare outlet must be of a diameter that allows easy nonrestricted flow of gas. You must locate flare line outlets on the downside of the facility and as far from the facility as is feasible, taking into account the prevailing wind directions, the wake effects caused by the facility and adjacent structure(s), and the height of all such facilities and structures. You must equip the flare outlet with an automatic ignition system including a pilot-light gas source or an equivalent system. You must have alternate methods for igniting the flare. You must pipe to the flare system used for H2S all vents from production process equipment, tanks, relief valves, burst plates, and similar devices.
                (7) Corrosion mitigation. You must use effective means of monitoring and controlling corrosion caused by acid gases (H2S and CO2) in both the downhole and surface portions of a production system. You must take specific corrosion monitoring and mitigating measures in areas of unusually severe corrosion where accumulation of water and/or higher concentration of H2S exists.
                (8) Wireline lubricators. Lubricators which may be exposed to fluids containing H2S must be of H2S-resistant materials.
                (9) Fuel and/or instrument gas. You must not use gas containing H2S for instrument gas. You must not use gas containing H2S for fuel gas without the prior approval of the District Manager.
                (10) Sensing lines and devices. Metals used for sensing line and safety-control devices which are necessarily exposed to H2S-bearing fluids must be constructed of H2S-corrosion resistant materials or coated so as to resist H2S corrosion.
                (11) Elastomer seals. You must use H2S-resistant materials for all seals which may be exposed to fluids containing H2S.
                (12) Water disposal. If you dispose of produced water by means other than subsurface injection, you must submit to the District Manager an analysis of the anticipated H2S content of the water at the final treatment vessel and at the discharge point. The District Manager may require that the water be treated for removal of H2S. The District Manager may require the submittal of an updated analysis if the water disposal rate or the potential H2S content increases.
                (13) Deck drains. You must equip open deck drains with traps or similar devices to prevent the escape of H2S gas into the atmosphere.
                (14) Sealed voids. You must take precautions to eliminate sealed spaces in piping designs (e.g., slip-on flanges, reinforcing pads) which can be invaded by atomic hydrogen when H2S is present.

                How do I manage the thermal effects caused by initial production on a newly completed or recompleted well?
                A newly completed or recompleted well often has thermal casing pressure during initial startup. Bleeding casing pressure during the startup process is considered a normal and necessary operation to manage thermal casing pressure; therefore, you do not need to evaluate these operations as a casing diagnostic test. After 30 days of continuous production, the initial production startup operation is complete and you must perform casing diagnostic testing as required in §§ 250.520 and 250.522.

                § 250.713
                What must I provide if I plan to use a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) for well operations?
                If you plan to use a MODU for well operations, you must provide:
                (a) Fitness requirements. Information and data to demonstrate the MODU's capability to perform at the proposed location. This information must include the maximum environmental and operational conditions that the MODU is designed to withstand, including the minimum air gap necessary for both hurricane and non-hurricane seasons. If sufficient environmental information and data are not available at the time you submit your APD or APM, the District Manager may approve your APD or APM, but require you to collect and report this information during operations. Under this circumstance, the District Manager may revoke the approval of the APD or APM if information collected during operations shows that the MODU is not capable of performing at the proposed location.
                (b) Foundation requirements. Information to show that site-specific soil and oceanographic conditions are capable of supporting the proposed bottom-founded MODU. If you provided sufficient site-specific information in your EP, DPP, or DOCD submitted to BOEM for that well location and conditions, you may reference that information. The District Manager may require you to conduct additional surveys and soil borings before approving the APD or APM if additional information is needed to make a determination that the conditions are capable of supporting the MODU, or equipment installed on a subsea wellhead. For a moored rig, you must submit a plat of the rig's anchor pattern approved in your EP, DPP, or DOCD in your APD or APM.
                (c) For frontier areas. (1) If the design of the MODU you plan to use in a frontier area is unique or has not been proven for use in the proposed environment, the District Manager may require you to submit a third-party review of the MODU design. If required, you must obtain a third-party review of your MODU similar to the process outlined in §§ 250.915 through 250.918. You may submit this information before submitting an APD or APM.
                (2) If you plan to conduct operations in a frontier area, you must have a contingency plan that addresses design and operating limitations of the MODU. Your plan must identify the actions necessary to maintain safety and prevent damage to the environment. Actions must include the suspension, curtailment, or modification of operations to remedy various operational or environmental situations (e.g., vessel motion, riser offset, anchor tensions, wind speed, wave height, currents, icing or ice-loading, settling, tilt or lateral movement, resupply capability).
                (d) Additional documentation. You must provide the current Certificate of Inspection (for U.S.-flag vessels) or Certificate of Compliance (for foreign-flag vessels) from the USCG and Certificate of Classification. You must also provide current documentation of any operational limitations imposed by an appropriate classification society.
                (e) Dynamically positioned MODU. If you use a dynamically positioned MODU, you must include in your APD or APM your contingency plan for moving off location in an emergency situation. At a minimum, your plan must address emergency events caused by storms, currents, station-keeping failures, power failures, and losses of well control. The District Manager may require your plan to include additional events that may require movement of the MODU and other information needed to clarify or further address how the MODU will respond to emergencies or other events.
                (f) Inspection of MODU. The MODU must be available for inspection by the District Manager before commencing operations and at any time during operations.
                (g) Current monitoring. For water depths greater than 400 meters (1,312 feet), you must include in your APD or APM:
                (1) A description of the specific current speeds that will cause you to implement rig shutdown, move-off procedures, or both; and
                (2) A discussion of the specific measures you will take to curtail rig operations and move off location when such currents are encountered. You may use criteria, such as current velocities, riser angles, watch circles, and remaining rig power to describe when these procedures or measures will be implemented.

                § 250.714
                Do I have to develop a dropped objects plan?
                If you use a floating rig unit in an area with subsea infrastructure, you must develop a dropped objects plan and make it available to BSEE upon request. This plan must be updated as the infrastructure on the seafloor changes. Your plan must include:
                (a) A description and plot of the path the rig will take while running and pulling the riser;
                (b) A plat showing the location of any subsea wells, production equipment, pipelines, and any other identified debris;

                (c) Modeling of a dropped object's path with consideration given to metocean conditions for various material forms, such as a tubular (e.g., riser or casing) and box (e.g., BOP or tree);
                
                (d) Communications, procedures, and delegated authorities established with the production host facility to shut-in any active subsea wells, equipment, or pipelines in the event of a dropped object; and
                (e) Any additional information required by the District Manager as appropriate to clarify, update, or evaluate your dropped objects plan.
              
              
                § 250.715
                Do I need a global positioning system (GPS) for all MODUs?
                All MODUs must have a minimum of two functioning GPS transponders at all times, and you must provide to BSEE real-time access to the GPS data prior to and during each hurricane season.
                (a) The GPS must be capable of monitoring the position and tracking the path in real-time if the MODU moves from its location during a severe storm.
                (b) You must install and protect the tracking system's equipment to minimize the risk of the system being disabled.
                (c) You must place the GPS transponders in different locations for redundancy to minimize risk of system failure.
                (d) Each GPS transponder must be capable of transmitting data for at least 7 days after a storm has passed.
                (e) If the MODU is moved off location in the event of a storm, you must immediately begin to record the GPS location data.
                (f) You must contact the Regional Office and allow real-time access to the MODU location data. When you contact the Regional Office, provide the following:
                (1) Name of the lessee and operator with contact information;
                (2) MODU name;
                (3) Initial date and time; and
                (4) How you will provide GPS real-time access.
              
            
            
              Well Operations
              
                § 250.720
                When and how must I secure a well?
                (a) Whenever you interrupt operations, you must notify the District Manager. Before moving off the well, you must have two independent barriers installed, at least one of which must be a mechanical barrier, as approved by the District Manager. You must install the barriers at appropriate depths within a properly cemented casing string or liner. Before removing a subsea BOP stack or surface BOP stack on a mudline suspension well, you must conduct a negative pressure test in accordance with § 250.721.
                (1) The events that would cause you to interrupt operations and notify the District Manager include, but are not limited to, the following:
                (i) Evacuation of the rig crew;
                (ii) Inability to keep the rig on location;
                (iii) Repair to major rig or well-control equipment; or
                (iv) Observed flow outside the well's casing (e.g., shallow water flow or bubbling).
                (2) The District Manager may approve alternate procedures or barriers, in accordance with § 250.141, if you do not have time to install the required barriers or if special circumstances occur.
                (b) Before you displace kill-weight fluid from the wellbore and/or riser, thereby creating an underbalanced state, you must obtain approval from the District Manager. To obtain approval, you must submit with your APD or APM your reasons for displacing the kill-weight fluid and provide detailed step-by-step written procedures describing how you will safely displace these fluids. The step-by-step displacement procedures must address the following:
                (1) Number and type of independent barriers, as described in § 250.420(b)(3), that are in place for each flow path that requires such barriers;
                (2) Tests you will conduct to ensure integrity of independent barriers;
                (3) BOP procedures you will use while displacing kill-weight fluids; and
                (4) Procedures you will use to monitor the volumes and rates of fluids entering and leaving the wellbore.
                (c) For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, in addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

                (1) If you move your drilling rig off a well prior to completion or permanent abandonment, you must ensure that any equipment left on, near, or in a wellbore that has penetrated below the surface casing is positioned in a manner to:
                (i) Protect the well head; and
                (ii) Prevent or minimize the likelihood of compromising the down-hole integrity of the well or the effectiveness of the well plugs.
                (2) In areas of ice scour you must use a well mudline cellar or an equivalent means of minimizing the risk of damage to the well head and wellbore. BSEE may approve an equivalent means that will meet or exceed the level of safety and environmental protection provided by a mudline cellar if the operator can show that utilizing a mudline cellar would compromise the stability of the rig, impede access to the well head during a well control event, or otherwise create operational risks.

                (2) You must perform a negative pressure test prior to unlatching the BOP at any point in the well. The negative pressure test must be performed on those components, at a minimum, that will be exposed to the negative differential pressure that will occur when the BOP is disconnected.
                (3) The District Manager may require you to perform additional negative pressure tests on other casing strings or liners (e.g., intermediate casing string or liner) or on wells with a surface BOP stack as appropriate to demonstrate casing or liner integrity.
                (4) You must submit for approval with your APD or APM, test procedures and criteria for a successful negative pressure test. If any of your test procedures or criteria for a successful test change, you must submit for approval the changes in a revised APD or APM.
                (5) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.
                (6) If you have any indication of a failed negative pressure test, such as, but not limited to, pressure buildup or observed flow, you must immediately investigate the cause. If your investigation confirms that a failure occurred during the negative pressure test, you must:
                (i) Correct the problem and immediately notify the appropriate District Manager; and
                (ii) Submit a description of the corrective action taken and receive approval from the appropriate District Manager for the retest.
                (7) You must have two barriers in place, as described in § 250.420(b)(3), at any time and for any well, prior to performing the negative pressure test.

              Blowout Preventer (BOP) System Requirements
              
                § 250.730
                What are the general requirements for BOP systems and system components?
                (a) You must ensure that the BOP system and system components are designed, installed, maintained, inspected, tested, and used properly to ensure well control. The working-pressure rating of each BOP component (excluding annular(s)) must exceed MASP as defined for the operation. For a subsea BOP, the MASP must be taken at the mudline. The BOP system includes the BOP stack, control system, and any other associated system(s) and equipment. The BOP system and individual components must be able to perform their expected functions and be compatible with each other. Your BOP system (excluding casing shear) must be capable of closing and sealing the wellbore at all times, including under anticipated flowing conditions for the specific well conditions, without losing ram closure time and sealing integrity due to the corrosiveness, volume, and abrasiveness of any fluids in the wellbore that the BOP system may encounter. Your BOP system must meet the following requirements:
                (1) The BOP requirements of API Standard 53 (incorporated by reference in § 250.198) and the requirements of §§ 250.733 through 250.739. If there is a conflict between API Standard 53, and the requirements of this subpart, you must follow the requirements of this subpart.
                (2) Those provisions of the following industry standards (all incorporated by reference in § 250.198) that apply to BOP systems:
                (i) ANSI/API Spec. 6A;
                (ii) ANSI/API Spec. 16A;
                (iii) ANSI/API Spec. 16C;
                (iv) API Spec. 16D; and
                (v) ANSI/API Spec. 17D.
                (3) For surface and subsea BOPs, the pipe and variable bore rams installed in the BOP stack must be capable of effectively closing and sealing on the tubular body of any drill pipe, workstring, and tubing (excluding tubing with exterior control lines and flat packs) in the hole under MASP, as defined for the operation, with the proposed regulator settings of the BOP control system.
                (4) The current set of approved schematic drawings must be available on the rig and at an onshore location. If you make any modifications to the BOP or control system that will change your BSEE-approved schematic drawings, you must suspend operations until you obtain approval from the District Manager.
                (b) You must ensure that the design, fabrication, maintenance, and repair of your BOP system is in accordance with the requirements contained in this part, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) recommendations unless otherwise directed by BSEE, and recognized engineering practices. The training and qualification of repair and maintenance personnel must meet or exceed any OEM training recommendations unless otherwise directed by BSEE.
                (c) You must follow the failure reporting procedures contained in API Standard 53, ANSI/API Spec. 6A, and ANSI/API Spec 16A (all incorporated by reference in § 250.198), and:
                (1) You must provide a written notice of equipment failure to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs, and the manufacturer of such equipment within 30 days after the discovery and identification of the failure. A failure is any condition that prevents the equipment from meeting the functional specification.

                (2) You must ensure that an investigation and a failure analysis are performed within 120 days of the failure to determine the cause of the failure. You must also ensure that the results and any corrective action are documented. If the investigation and analysis are performed by an entity other than the manufacturer, you must ensure that the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs and the manufacturer receive a copy of the analysis report.
                (3) If the equipment manufacturer notifies you that it has changed the design of the equipment that failed or if you have changed operating or repair procedures as a result of a failure, then you must, within 30 days of such changes, report the design change or modified procedures in writing to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs.
                (4) You must send the reports required in this paragraph to: Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.
                (d) If you plan to use a BOP stack manufactured after the effective date of this regulation, you must use one manufactured pursuant to an API Spec. Q1 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198) quality management system. Such quality management system must be certified by an entity that meets the requirements of ISO 17011.
                (1) BSEE may consider accepting equipment manufactured under quality assurance programs other than API Spec. Q1, provided you submit a request to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs for approval, containing relevant information about the alternative program.
                (2) You must submit this request to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, Virginia 20166.

The working-pressure rating of each BOP component (excluding annular(s)) must exceed MASP as defined for the operation. For a subsea BOP, the MASP must be determined at the mudline. The BOP system includes the BOP stack, control system, and any other associated system(s) and equipment. The BOP system and individual components must be able to perform their expected functions and be compatible with each other. Your BOP system must be capable of closing and sealing the wellbore in the event of flow due to a kick, including under anticipated flowing conditions for the specific well conditions, without losing ram closure time and sealing integrity due to the corrosiveness, volume, and abrasiveness of any fluids in the wellbore that the BOP system may encounter. Your BOP system must meet the following requirements:
                      (1) The BOP requirements of API Standard 53 (incorporated by reference in § 250.198) and the requirements of §§ 250.733 through 250.739. If there is a conflict between API Standard 53 and the requirements of this subpart, you must follow the requirements of this subpart.
                      (2) The provisions of the following industry standards (all incorporated by reference in § 250.198) that apply to BOP systems:
                      (i) ANSI/API Spec. 6A;
                      (ii) ANSI/API Spec. 16A;
                      (iii) ANSI/API Spec. 16C;
                      (iv) API Spec. 16D; and
                      (v) ANSI/API Spec. 17D.
                      (3) For surface and subsea BOPs, the pipe and variable bore rams installed in the BOP stack must be capable of effectively closing and sealing on the tubular body of any drill pipe, workstring, and tubing (excluding tubing with exterior control lines and flat packs) in the hole under MASP, as defined for the operation, at the proposed regulator settings of the BOP control system.
                      (4) The current set of approved schematic drawings must be available on the rig and at an onshore location. If you make any modifications to the BOP or control system that will require changes to your BSEE-approved schematic drawings, you must suspend operations until you obtain approval from the District Manager.
                      (b) You must ensure that the design, fabrication, maintenance, and repair of your BOP system is in accordance with the requirements contained in this part, applicable Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) recommendations unless otherwise directed by BSEE, and recognized engineering practices. The training and qualification of repair and maintenance personnel must meet or exceed applicable OEM training recommendations unless otherwise directed by BSEE.

                      (c) You must follow the failure reporting procedures contained in API Standard 53, (incorporated by reference in § 250.198), and:
                      
                      (1) You must provide a written notice of equipment failure to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs (OORP), unless BSEE has designated a third party as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and the manufacturer of such equipment within 30 days after the discovery and identification of the failure. A failure is any condition that prevents the equipment from meeting the functional specification.
                      (2) You must ensure that an investigation and a failure analysis are started within 120 days of the failure to determine the cause of the failure, and are completed within 120 days upon starting the investigation and failure analysis. You must also ensure that the results and any corrective action are documented. You must ensure that the analysis report is submitted to the Chief OORP, unless BSEE has designated a third party as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, as well as the manufacturer. If you cannot complete the investigation and analysis within the specified time, you must submit an extension request detailing how you will complete the investigation and analysis to BSEE for approval. You must submit the extension request to the Chief, OORP.
                      (3) If the equipment manufacturer notifies you that it has changed the design of the equipment that failed or if you have changed operating or repair procedures as a result of a failure, then you must, within 30 days of such changes, report the design change or modified procedures in writing to the Chief OORP, unless BSEE has designated a third party as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
                      (4) Submit notices and reports to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, Virginia 20166. BSEE may designate a third party to receive the data and reports on behalf of BSEE. If BSEE designates a third party, you must submit the data and reports to the designated third party.
                      (d) If you plan to use a BOP stack manufactured after the effective date of this regulation, you must use one manufactured pursuant to an ANSI/API Spec. Q1 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198) quality management system. Such quality management system must be certified by an entity that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 17021-1 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198).
                      (1) BSEE may consider accepting equipment manufactured under quality assurance programs other than ANSI/API Spec. Q1, provided you submit a request to the Chief, OORP for approval, containing relevant information about the alternative program.
                      (2) You must submit this request to the Chief, OORP; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, Virginia 20166.

                § 250.733
                What are the requirements for a surface BOP stack?
                (a) When you drill or conduct operations with a surface BOP stack, you must install the BOP system before drilling or conducting operations to deepen the well below the surface casing and after the well is deepened below the surface casing point. The surface BOP stack must include at least four remote-controlled, hydraulically operated BOPs, consisting of one annular BOP, one BOP equipped with blind shear rams, and two BOPs equipped with pipe rams.
                (1) The blind shear rams must be capable of shearing at any point along the tubular body of any drill pipe (excluding tool joints, bottom-hole tools, and bottom hole assemblies that include heavy-weight pipe or collars), workstring, tubing provided that the capability to shear tubing with exterior control lines is not required prior to April 30, 2018, and any electric-, wire-, and slick-line that is in the hole and sealing the wellbore after shearing. If your blind shear rams are unable to cut any electric-, wire-, or slick-line under MASP as defined for the operation and seal the wellbore, you must use an alternative cutting device capable of shearing the lines before closing the BOP. This device must be available on the rig floor during operations that require their use.
                (2) The two BOPs equipped with pipe rams must be capable of closing and sealing on the tubular body of any drill pipe, workstring, and tubing under MASP, as defined for the operation, except for tubing with exterior control lines and flat packs, a bottom hole assembly that includes heavy-weight pipe or collars, and bottom-hole tools.
                (b) If you plan to use a surface BOP on a floating production facility you must:
                (1) For BOPs installed after April 29, 2019, follow the BOP requirements in § 250.734(a)(1).
                (2) For risers installed after July 28, 2016, use a dual bore riser configuration before drilling or operating in any hole section or interval where hydrocarbons are, or may be, exposed to the well. The dual bore riser must meet the design requirements of API RP 2RD (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), including appropriate design for the maximum anticipated operating and environmental conditions.
                (i) For a dual bore riser configuration, the annulus between the risers must be monitored for pressure during operations. You must describe in your APD or APM your annulus monitoring plan and how you will secure the well in the event a leak is detected.
                (ii) The inner riser for a dual riser configuration is subject to the requirements at § 250.721 for testing the casing or liner.

                (c) You must install separate side outlets on the BOP stack for the kill and choke lines. If your stack does not have side outlets, you must install a drilling spool with side outlets. The outlet valves must hold pressure from both directions.
                
                (d) You must install a choke and a kill line on the BOP stack. You must equip each line with two full-bore, full-opening valves, one of which must be remote-controlled. On the kill line, you may install a check valve and a manual valve instead of the remote-controlled valve. To use this configuration, both manual valves must be readily accessible and you must install the check valve between the manual valves and the pump.

                      What associated systems and related equipment must all BOP systems include?
                      
                      (a) An accumulator system (as specified in API Standard 53, incorporated by reference in § 250.198). Your accumulator system must have the fluid volume capacity and appropriate pre-charge pressures in accordance with API Standard 53. If you supply the accumulator regulators by rig air and do not have a secondary source of pneumatic supply, you must equip the regulators with manual overrides or other devices to ensure capability of hydraulic operations if rig air is lost;
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 250.736
                What are the requirements for choke manifolds, kelly-type valves inside BOPs, and drill string safety valves?
                (a) Your BOP system must include a choke manifold that is suitable for the anticipated surface pressures, anticipated methods of well control, the surrounding environment, and the corrosiveness, volume, and abrasiveness of drilling fluids and well fluids that you may encounter.
                (b) Choke manifold components must have a RWP at least as great as the RWP of the ram BOPs. If your choke manifold has buffer tanks downstream of choke assemblies, you must install isolation valves on any bleed lines.
                (c) Valves, pipes, flexible steel hoses, and other fittings upstream of the choke manifold must have a RWP at least as great as the RWP of the ram BOPs.

                (d) You must use the following BOP equipment with a RWP and temperature of at least as great as the working pressure and temperature of the ram BOP during all operations:
                (1) The applicable kelly-type valves as described in API Standard 53 (incorporated by reference in § 250.198);
                (2) On a top-drive system equipped with a remote-controlled valve, a strippable kelly-type valve must be installed below the remote-controlled valve;
                (3) An inside BOP in the open position located on the rig floor. You must be able to install an inside BOP for each size connection in the pipe;
                (4) A drill string safety valve in the open position located on the rig floor. You must have a drill-string safety valve available for each size connection in the pipe;
                (5) When running casing, a safety valve in the open position available on the rig floor to fit the casing string being run in the hole;

                (6) All required manual and remote- controlled kelly-type valves, drill-string safety valves, and comparable-type valves (i.e., kelly-type valve in a top-drive system) that are essentially full opening; and
                (7) A wrench to fit each manual valve. Each wrench must be readily accessible to the drilling crew.

                  At 84 FR 21981, May 15, 2019, § 250.736 was amended by revising paragraph (d)(5), effective July 15, 2019. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
                  
                    
                      § 250.736
                      What are the requirements for choke manifolds, kelly-type valves inside BOPs, and drill string safety valves?
                      
                      (d) * * *
                      (5) When running casing, a safety valve in the open position available on the rig floor to fit the casing string being run in the hole. For subsea BOPs, the safety valve must be available on the rig floor if the length of casing being run exceeds the water depth, which would result in the casing being across the BOP stack and the rig floor prior to crossing over to the drill pipe running string;
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 250.737
                What are the BOP system testing requirements?
                Your BOP system (this includes the choke manifold, kelly-type valves, inside BOP, and drill string safety valve) must meet the following testing requirements:
                (a) Pressure test frequency. You must pressure test your BOP system:
                (1) When installed;
                (2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test, or 30 days since your last blind shear ram BOP pressure test. You must begin to test your BOP system before midnight on the 14th day (or 30th day for your blind shear rams) following the conclusion of the previous test;
                (3) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. You may omit this pressure test requirement if you did not remove the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner, the required BOP test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than the test pressures for the previous BOP test, and the time elapsed between tests has not exceeded 14 days (or 30 days for blind shear rams). You must indicate in your APD which casing strings and liners meet these criteria;
                (4) The District Manager may require more frequent testing if conditions or your BOP performance warrant.
                (b) Pressure test procedures. When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each BOP component. You must begin each test by conducting the low-pressure test then transition to the high-pressure test. Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. The table in this paragraph (b) outlines your pressure test requirements.
                
                  
                    You must conduct a . . .
                    According to the following procedures . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Low-pressure test
                    All low-pressure tests must be between 250 and 350 psi. Any initial pressure above 350 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 250 and 350 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and reinitiate the test.
                  
                  
                    
                    (2) High-pressure test for blind shear ram-type BOPs, ram-type BOPs, the choke manifold, outside of all choke and kill side outlet valves (and annular gas bleed valves for subsea BOP), inside of all choke and kill side outlet valves below uppermost ram, and other BOP components
                    The high-pressure test must equal the RWP of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your calculated MASP, as defined for the operation for the applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test pressures in your APD.
                  
                  
                    (3) High-pressure test for annular-type BOPs, inside of choke or kill valves (and annular gas bleed valves for subsea BOP) above the uppermost ram BOP
                    The high pressure test must equal 70 percent of the RWP of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your calculated MASP, as defined for the operation for the applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test pressures in your APD.
                  
                
                (c) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required pressure for 5 minutes, which must be recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours. However, for surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. The recorded test pressures must be within the middle half of the chart range, i.e., cannot be within the lower or upper one-fourth of the chart range. If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must correct the problem and retest the affected component(s).
                (d) Additional test requirements. You must meet the following additional BOP testing requirements:
                
                  
                    You must . . .

                      (c) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required pressure for 5 minutes, which must be recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. However, for surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. The recorded test pressures must be within the middle half of the chart range, i.e., cannot be within the lower or upper one-fourth of the chart range. If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must correct the problem and retest the affected component(s).

                    Contact the District Manager and request approval in your APD or APM. Your request must include a report from a BAVO on the equipment's design and suitability for its intended use as well as any other information required by the District Manager. The District Manager may impose any conditions regarding the equipment's capabilities, operation, and testing.
                  
                  
                    (n) You have pipe/variable bore rams that have no current utility or well-control purposes;
                    Indicate in your APD or APM which pipe/variable bore rams meet these criteria and clearly label them on all BOP control panels. You do not need to function test or pressure test pipe/variable bore rams having no current utility, and that will not be used for well-control purposes, until such time as they are intended to be used during operations.
                  
                  
                    (o) You install redundant components for well control in your BOP system that are in addition to the required components of this subpart (e.g., pipe/variable bore rams, shear rams, annular preventers, gas bleed lines, and choke/kill side outlets or lines);
                    Comply with all testing, maintenance, and inspection requirements in this subpart that are applicable to those well-control components. If any redundant component fails a test, you must submit a report from a BAVO that describes the failure and confirms that there is no impact on the BOP that will make it unfit for well-control purposes. You must submit this report to the District Manager and receive approval before resuming operations. The District Manager may require you to provide additional information as needed to clarify or evaluate your report.

                Subsurface safety devices in injection wells—dry trees.
                You must install a surface-controlled SSSV or an injection valve capable of preventing backflow in all injection wells. This requirement is not applicable if the District Manager determines that the well is incapable of natural flow. You must verify the no-flow condition of the well annually.
              
              
                § 250.817
                Temporary removal of subsurface safety devices for routine operations.

                (a) You may remove a wireline- or pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device without further authorization or notice, for a routine operation that does not require BSEE approval of a Form BSEE-0124, Application for Permit to Modify (APM). For a list of these routine operations, see § 250.601. The removal period must not exceed 15 days.
                (b) Prior to removal, you must identify the well by placing a sign on the wellhead stating that the subsurface safety device was removed. You must note the removal of the subsurface safety device in the records required by § 250.890. If the master valve is open, you must ensure that a trained person (see § 250.891) is in the immediate vicinity to attend the well and take any necessary emergency actions.
                (c) You must monitor a platform well when a subsurface safety device has been removed, but a person does not need to remain in the well-bay area continuously if the master valve is closed. If the well is on a satellite structure, it must be attended by a support vessel, or a pump-through plug must be installed in the tubing at least 100 feet below the mudline and the master valve must be closed, unless otherwise approved by the appropriate District Manager.
                (d) You must not allow the well to flow while the subsurface safety device is removed, except when it is necessary for the particular operation for which the SSSV is removed. The provisions of this paragraph are not applicable to the testing and inspection procedures specified in § 250.880.

                Subsea tree subsurface safety devices—general.
                (a) For wells using subsea (wet) trees or for which you intend to install subsea trees, you must equip all tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing zones with subsurface safety devices that will shut off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency. You must also install flow couplings above and below the subsurface safety devices. For instances where the well at issue is incapable of natural flow, you may seek District Manager approval for using alternative procedures or equipment, if you propose to use a subsea safety system that is not capable of shutting off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency. Subsurface safety devices include the following and any associated safety valve lock and landing nipple:
                (1) A surface-controlled SSSV;
                (2) An injection valve;
                (3) A tubing plug; and
                (4) A tubing/annular subsurface safety device.
                (b) After installing the subsea tree, but before the rig or installation vessel leaves the area, you must test all valves and sensors to ensure that they are operating as designed and meet all the conditions specified in this subpart.

                Subsurface safety devices in shut-in wells—subsea trees.
                (a) You must equip all new subsea tree completions (perforated but not placed on production) and completions shut-in for a period of 6 months with one of the following:
                (1) A pump-through-type tubing plug;
                (2) An injection valve capable of preventing backflow; or
                (3) A surface-controlled SSSV, provided the surface control has been rendered inoperative. For purposes of this section, a surface-controlled SSSV is considered inoperative if, for a direct hydraulic control system, you have bled the hydraulics from the control line and have isolated it from the hydraulic control pressure. If your controls employ an electro-hydraulic control umbilical and the hydraulic control pressure to the individual well cannot be isolated, a surface-controlled SSSV is considered inoperative if you perform the following:

                (i) Disable the control function of the surface-controlled SSSV within the logic of the programmable logic controller which controls the subsea well;
                
                (ii) Place a pressure alarm high on the control line to the surface-controlled SSSV of the subsea well; and
                (iii) Close the USV and at least one other tree valve on the subsea well.
                (b) When warranted by conditions, such as unstable bottom conditions, permafrost, hydrate formation, and paraffin problems, the District Manager must approve the setting depth of the subsurface safety device for a shut-in well on a case-by-case basis.

                Emergency action and safety system shutdown—subsea trees.
                (a) If your facility is impacted or will potentially be impacted by an emergency situation (e.g., an impending National Weather Service-named tropical storm or hurricane, ice events, or post-earthquake), you must shut-in all subsea wells unless otherwise approved by the District Manager. A shut-in is defined as a closed BSDV, USV, GLSDV, and surface-controlled SSSV.
                (b) When operating a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) or other type of workover or intervention vessel in an area with subsea infrastructure, you must:
                (1) Suspend production from all wells that could be affected by a dropped object, including upstream wells that flow through the same pipeline; or
                (2) Establish direct, real-time communications between the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel and the production facility control room and develop a dropped objects plan, as required in § 250.714. If an object is dropped, you must immediately secure the well directly under the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel while simultaneously communicating with the platform to shut-in all affected wells. You must also maintain without disruption, and continuously verify, communication between the production facility and the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel. If communication is lost between the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel and the platform for 20 or more minutes, you must shut-in all wells that could be affected by a dropped object.
                (c) In the event of an emergency, you must operate your production system according to the valve closure times in the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839 for the following conditions:
                (1) Process upset. In the event an upset in the production process train occurs downstream of the BSDV, you must close the BSDV in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839. You may reopen the BSDV to blow down the pipeline to prevent hydrates, provided you have secured the well(s) and ensured adequate protection.
                (2) Pipeline pressure safety high and low (PSHL) sensor. In the event that either a high or a low pressure condition is detected by a PSHL sensor located upstream of the BSDV, you must secure the affected well and pipeline, and all wells and pipelines associated with a dual or multi pipeline system, by closing the BSDVs, USVs, and surface-controlled SSSVs in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839. You must obtain approval from the appropriate District Manager to resume production in the unaffected pipeline(s) of a dual or multi pipeline system. If the PSHL sensor activation was a false alarm, you may return the wells to production without contacting the appropriate District Manager.
                
                (3) ESD/TSE (platform). In the event of an ESD activation that is initiated because of a platform ESD or platform TSE not associated with the BSDV, you must close the BSDV, USV, and surface-controlled SSSV in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839.
                (4) Subsea ESD (platform) or BSDV TSE. In the event of an emergency shutdown activation that is initiated by the host platform due to an abnormal condition subsea, or a TSE associated with the BSDV, you must close the BSDV, USV, and surface-controlled SSSV in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839.
                (5) Subsea ESD (MODU). In the event of an ESD activation that is initiated by a dropped object from a MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel, you must secure all wells in the proximity of the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel by closing the USVs and surface-controlled SSSVs in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839.

                (1) Equip flowlines from wells with both PSH and PSL sensors. You must locate these sensors in accordance with section A.1 of API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198).

                (2) Use pressure recording devices to establish the new operating pressure ranges of flowlines at any time when the normalized system pressure changes by 50 psig or 5 percent, whichever is higher. The pressure recording devices must document the pressure range over time intervals that are no less than 4 hours and no more than 30 days long.
                
                (3) Maintain the most recent pressure recording information you used to determine operating pressure ranges at your field office nearest the OCS facility or at another location conveniently available to the District Manager for as long as the information is valid.
                (b) Flowline shut-in sensors must meet the requirements in the following table (initial set points for pressure sensors must be set using gauge readings and engineering design):

                    (2) PSL sensor,
                    Must be set no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi (whichever is greater) below the lowest operating pressure of the flowline in which it is installed.
                  
                
                (c) If a well flows directly to a pipeline before separation, the flowline and valves from the well located upstream of and including the header inlet valve(s) must have a working pressure equal to or greater than the maximum shut-in pressure of the well unless the flowline is protected by one of the following:

                (2) A temperature safety high (TSH) sensor in the discharge piping of each compressor cylinder or case discharge.
                (3) You must design the PSH and PSL sensors and LSH controls protecting compressor suction and interstage scrubbers to actuate automatic SDVs located in each compressor suction and fuel gas line so that the compressor unit and the associated vessels can be isolated from all input sources. All automatic SDVs installed in compressor suction and fuel gas piping must also be actuated by the shutdown of the prime mover. Unless otherwise approved by the District Manager, gas-well gas affected by the closure of the automatic SDV on the suction side of a compressor must be diverted to the pipeline, diverted to a flare or vent in accordance with §§ 250.1160 or 250.1161, or shut-in at the wellhead.

                § 250.868
                Non-metallic piping.
                On fixed OCS facilities, you may use non-metallic piping (such as that made from polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, and reinforced fiberglass) only in accordance with the requirements of § 250.841(b).
              
              
                § 250.869
                General platform operations.
                (a) Surface or subsurface safety devices must not be bypassed or blocked out of service unless they are temporarily out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing. You may take only the minimum number of safety devices out of service. Personnel must monitor the bypassed or blocked-out functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any surface or subsurface safety device which is temporarily out of service must be flagged. A designated visual indicator must be used to identify the bypassed safety device. You must follow the monitoring procedures as follows:

                (1) If you are using a non-computer-based system, meaning your safety system operates primarily with pneumatic supply or non-programmable electrical systems, you must monitor bypassed safety devices by positioning monitoring personnel at either the control panel for the bypassed safety device, or at the bypassed safety device, or at the component that the bypassed safety device would be monitoring when in service. You must also ensure that monitoring personnel are able to view all relevant essential operating conditions until all bypassed safety devices are placed back in service and are able to initiate shut-in action in the event of an abnormal condition.
                (2) If you are using a computer-based technology system, meaning a computer-controlled electronic safety system such as supervisory control and data acquisition and remote terminal units, you must monitor bypassed safety devices by maintaining instantaneous communications at all times among remote monitoring personnel and the personnel performing maintenance, testing, or startup. Until all bypassed safety devices are placed back in service, you must also position monitoring personnel at a designated control station that is capable of the following:
                (i) Displaying all relevant essential operating conditions that affect the bypassed safety device, well, pipeline, and process component. If electronic display of all relevant essential conditions is not possible, you must have field personnel monitoring the level gauges (sight glass) and pressure gauges in order to know the current operating conditions. You must be in communication with all field personnel monitoring the gauges;
                (ii) Controlling the production process equipment and the entire safety system;
                (iii) Displaying a visual indicator when safety devices are placed in the bypassed mode; and
                (iv) Upon command, overriding the bypassed safety device and initiating shut-in action in the event of an abnormal condition.
                (3) You must not bypass for startup any element of the emergency support system or other support system required by API RP 14C, Appendix C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198) without first receiving BSEE approval to depart from this operating procedure. These systems include, but are not limited to:
                (i) The ESD system to provide a method to manually initiate platform shutdown by personnel observing abnormal conditions or undesirable events. You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for manual reset and/or initial charging of the system;
                (ii) The fire loop system to sense the heat of a fire and initiate platform shutdown, and other fire detection devices (flame, thermal, and smoke) that are used to enhance fire detection capability. You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for manual reset and/or initial charging of the system;
                (iii) The combustible gas detection system to sense the presence of hydrocarbons and initiate alarms and platform shutdown before gas concentrations reach the lower explosive limit;
                (iv) Adequate ventilation;
                (v) The containment system to collect escaped liquid hydrocarbons and initiate platform shutdown;
                (vi) Subsurface safety valves, including those that are self-actuated (subsurface-controlled SSSVs) or those that are activated by an ESD system and/or a fire loop (surface-controlled SSSV). You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for routine operations in accordance with § 250.817;
                (vii) The pneumatic supply system; and
                (viii) The system for discharging gas to the atmosphere.
                (4) In instances where components of the ESD, as listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, are bypassed for maintenance, precautions must be taken to provide the equivalent level of protection that existed prior to the bypass.
                (b) When wells are disconnected from producing facilities and blind flanged, or equipped with a tubing plug, or the master valves have been locked closed, you are not required to comply with the provisions of API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198) or this regulation concerning the following:
                (1) Automatic fail-close SSVs on wellhead assemblies, and

                (2) The PSH and PSL sensors in flowlines from wells.
                
                (c) When pressure or atmospheric vessels are isolated from production facilities (e.g., inlet valve locked closed or inlet blind-flanged) and are to remain isolated for an extended period of time, safety device testing in accordance with API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198), or this subpart is not required, with the exception of the PSV, unless the vessel is open to the atmosphere.
                (d) All open-ended lines connected to producing facilities and wells must be plugged or blind-flanged, except those lines designed to be open-ended such as flare or vent lines.
                (e) On all new production safety system installations, component process control devices and component safety devices must not be installed utilizing the same sensing points.
                (f) All pneumatic control panels and computer based control stations must be labeled according to API RP 14C nomenclature.
              
              
                § 250.870
                Time delays on pressure safety low (PSL) sensors.
                (a) You may apply industry standard Class B, Class C, or Class B/C logic to applicable PSL sensors installed on process equipment. If the device may be bypassed for greater than 45 seconds, you must monitor the bypassed devices in accordance with § 250.869(a). You must document on your field test records any use of a PSL sensor with a time delay greater than 45 seconds. For purposes of this section, PSL sensors are categorized as follows:
                (1) Class B safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed for a fixed time period (typically less than 15 seconds, but not more than 45 seconds). Examples include sensors used in conjunction with the design of pump and compressor panels such as PSL sensors, lubricator no-flows, and high-water jacket temperature shutdowns.

                (2) Class C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed until the component comes into full service (i.e., the time at which the startup pressure equals or exceeds the set pressure of the PSL sensor, the system reaches a stabilized pressure, and the PSL sensor clears). If a Class C safety device is bypassed, you must monitor the device until it is in full service.
                (3) Class B/C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to incorporate a combination of Class B and Class C circuitry. These devices are used to ensure that the PSL sensors are not unnecessarily bypassed during startup and idle operations, (e.g., Class B/C bypass circuitry activates when a pump is shut down during normal operations). The PSL sensor remains bypassed until the pump's start circuitry is activated and either:
                (i) The Class B timer expires no later than 45 seconds from start activation, or
                (ii) The Class C bypass is initiated until the pump builds up pressure above the PSL sensor set point and the PSL sensor comes into full service.
                (b) If you do not install time delay circuitry that bypasses activation of PSL sensor shutdown logic for a specified time period on process and product transport equipment during startup and idle operations, you must manually bypass (pin out or disengage) the PSL sensor, with a time delay not to exceed 45 seconds.

Transport tanks approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation, that are sealed and not connected via interconnected piping to the production process train and that are used only for storage of refined liquid hydrocarbons or Class I liquids, are not required to be equipped with the protective equipment identified in API RP 14C, section A.5. The atmospheric vessels connected to the process system that contains a Class I liquid and the associated pumps must be reflected on the design documents listed in § 250.842(a)(1) through (4) and (b)(3).
                (b) You must ensure that all atmospheric vessels are designed and maintained to ensure the proper working conditions for LSH sensors. The LSH sensor bridle must be designed to prevent different density fluids from impacting sensor functionality.
                (c) You must ensure that all atmospheric vessels are designed, installed, and maintained to prevent pollution, including the displacement of oil out of an overboard water outlet, as required by § 250.300(b)(3) and (4).

                (a) Include the installation of an isolation valve at the inlet of your subsea pump module.

                (b) Include a PSHL sensor upstream of the BSDV, if the maximum possible discharge pressure of the subsea pump operating in a dead head condition (that is the maximum shut-in tubing pressure at the pump inlet and a closed BSDV) is less than the MAOP of the associated pipeline.
                (c) If the maximum possible discharge pressure of the subsea pump operating in a dead head situation could be greater than the MAOP of the pipeline:
                (1) Include, at minimum, 2 independent functioning PSHL sensors upstream of the subsea pump and 2 independent functioning PSHL sensors downstream of the pump, that:
                (i) Are operational when the subsea pump is in service; and
                (ii) Will, when activated, shut down the subsea pump, the subsea inlet isolation valve, and either the designated USV1, the USV2, or the alternate isolation valve.
                (iii) If more than 2 PSHL sensors are installed both upstream and downstream of the subsea pump for operational flexibility, then 2 out of 3 voting logic may be implemented in which the subsea pump remains operational provided a minimum of 2 independent PSHL sensors are functional both upstream and downstream of the pump.
                (2) Interlock the subsea pump motor with the BSDV to ensure that the pump cannot start or operate when the BSDV is closed, incorporate at a minimum the following permissive signals into the control system for your subsea pump, and ensure that the subsea pump is not able to be started or re-started unless:
                (i) The BSDV is open;
                (ii) All automated valves downstream of the subsea pump are open;
                (iii) The upstream subsea pump isolation valve is open; and

                (iv) All parameters associated with the subsea pump operation (e.g., pump temperature high, pump vibration high, pump suction pressure high, pump discharge pressure high, pump suction flow low) must be cleared (i.e., within operational limits) or continuously monitored by personnel who observe visual indicators displayed at a designated control station and have the capability to initiate shut-in action in the event of an abnormal condition.
                (3) Monitor the separator for seawater.
                (4) Ensure that the subsea pump systems are controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system.
                (d) Follow the valve closure times and hydraulic bleed requirements according to your approved DWOP for the following:
                (1) Electro-hydraulic control system with a subsea pump;
                (2) A loss of communication with the subsea well(s) and not a loss of communication with the subsea pump control system without an ESD or sensor activation;
                (3) A loss of communication with the subsea pump control system, and not a loss of communication with the subsea well(s);
                (4) A loss of communication with the subsea well(s) and the subsea pump control system.
                (e) For subsea pump testing:
                (1) Perform a complete subsea pump function test, including full shutdown, after any intervention or changes to the software and equipment affecting the subsea pump; and
                (2) Test the subsea pump shutdown, including PSHL sensors both upstream and downstream of the pump, each quarter (not to exceed 120 days between tests). This testing may be performed concurrently with the ESD function test required by § 250.880(c)(4)(v).

                § 250.906
                What must I do to obtain approval for the proposed site of my platform?
                (a) Shallow hazards surveys. You must perform a high-resolution or acoustic-profiling survey to obtain information on the conditions existing at and near the surface of the seafloor. You must collect information through this survey sufficient to determine the presence of the following features and their likely effects on your proposed platform:
                (1) Shallow faults;
                (2) Gas seeps or shallow gas;
                (3) Slump blocks or slump sediments;
                (4) Shallow water flows;
                (5) Hydrates; or
                (6) Ice scour of seafloor sediments.
                (b) Geologic surveys. You must perform a geological survey relevant to the design and siting of your platform. Your geological survey must assess:
                (1) Seismic activity at your proposed site;
                (2) Fault zones, the extent and geometry of faulting, and attenuation effects of geologic conditions near your site; and
                (3) For platforms located in producing areas, the possibility and effects of seafloor subsidence.
                (c) Subsurface surveys. Depending upon the design and location of your proposed platform and the results of the shallow hazard and geologic surveys, the Regional Supervisor may require you to perform a subsurface survey. This survey will include a testing program for investigating the stratigraphic and engineering properties of the soil that may affect the foundations or anchoring systems for your facility. The testing program must include adequate in situ testing, boring, and sampling to examine all important soil and rock strata to determine its strength classification, deformation properties, and dynamic characteristics. If required to perform a subsurface survey, you must prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor a summary report to briefly describe the results of your soil testing program, the various field and laboratory test methods employed, and the applicability of these methods as they pertain to the quality of the samples, the type of soil, and the anticipated design application. You must explain how the engineering properties of each soil stratum affect the design of your platform. In your explanation you must describe the uncertainties inherent in your overall testing program, and the reliability and applicability of each test method.
                (d) Overall site investigation report. You must prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor an overall site investigation report for your platform that integrates the findings of your shallow hazards surveys and geologic surveys, and, if required, your subsurface surveys. Your overall site investigation report must include analyses of the potential for:
                (1) Scouring of the seafloor;
                (2) Hydraulic instability;
                (3) The occurrence of sand waves;
                (4) Instability of slopes at the platform location;
                (5) Liquefaction, or possible reduction of soil strength due to increased pore pressures;
                (6) Degradation of subsea permafrost layers;
                (7) Cyclic loading;
                (8) Lateral loading;
                (9) Dynamic loading;
                (10) Settlements and displacements;
                
                (11) Plastic deformation and formation collapse mechanisms; and
                (12) Soil reactions on the platform foundations or anchoring systems.
              
              
                § 250.907
                Where must I locate foundation boreholes?
                (a) For fixed or bottom-founded platforms and tension leg platforms, your maximum distance from any foundation pile to a soil boring must not exceed 500 feet.
                (b) For deepwater floating platforms which utilize catenary or taut-leg moorings, you must take borings at the most heavily loaded anchor location, at the anchor points approximately 120 and 240 degrees around the anchor pattern from that boring, and, as necessary, other points throughout the anchor pattern to establish the soil profile suitable for foundation design purposes.
              
              
                § 250.908
                What are the minimum structural fatigue design requirements?
                (a) API RP 2A-WSD, Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing and Constructing Fixed Offshore Platforms (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), requires that the design fatigue life of each joint and member be twice the intended service life of the structure. When designing your platform, the following table provides minimum fatigue life safety factors for critical structural members and joints.
                
                  
                    If . . .
                    Then . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) There is sufficient structural redundancy to prevent catastrophic failure of the platform or structure under consideration,
                    The results of the fatigue analysis must indicate a minimum calculated life of twice the design life of the platform.
                  
                  
                    (2) There is not sufficient structural redundancy to prevent catastrophic failure of the platform or structure,
                    The results of a fatigue analysis must indicate a minimum calculated life or three times the design life of the platform.
                  
                  
                    (3) The desirable degree of redundancy is significantly reduced as a result of fatigue damage,
                    The results of a fatigue analysis must indicate a minimum calculated life of three times the design life of the platform.
                  
                
                (b) The documents incorporated by reference in § 250.901 may require larger safety factors than indicated in paragraph (a) of this section for some key components. When the documents incorporated by reference require a larger safety factor than the chart in paragraph (a) of this section, the requirements of the incorporated document will prevail.

              Platform Verification Program
              
                § 250.909
                What is the Platform Verification Program?
                The Platform Verification Program is the BSEE approval process for ensuring that floating platforms; platforms of a new or unique design; platforms in seismic areas; or platforms located in deepwater or frontier areas meet stringent requirements for design and construction. The program is applied during construction of new platforms and major modifications of, or repairs to, existing platforms. These requirements are in addition to the requirements of the Platform Approval Program described in §§ 250.904 through 250.908 of this subpart.
              
              
                § 250.910
                Which of my facilities are subject to the Platform Verification Program?
                (a) All new fixed or bottom-founded platforms that meet any of the following five conditions are subject to the Platform Verification Program:
                (1) Platforms installed in water depths exceeding 400 feet (122 meters);
                (2) Platforms having natural periods in excess of 3 seconds;
                (3) Platforms installed in areas of unstable bottom conditions;
                (4) Platforms having configurations and designs which have not previously been used or proven for use in the area; or
                (5) Platforms installed in seismically active areas.

                (b) All new floating platforms are subject to the Platform Verification Program to the extent indicated in the following table:
                
                
                  
                    If . . .
                    Then . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Your new floating platform is a buoyant offshore facility that does not have a ship-shaped hull,
                    The entire platform is subject to the Platform Verification Program including the following associated structures:
                  
                  
                     
                    (i) Drilling, production, and pipeline risers, and riser tensioning systems (each platform must be designed to accommodate all the loads imposed by all risers and riser does not have tensioning systems);(ii) Turrets and turret-and-hull interfaces;
                      (iii) Foundations, foundation pilings and templates, and anchoring systems; and
                      (iv) Mooring or tethering systems.
                    
                  
                  
                    (2) Your new floating platform is a buoyant offshore facility with a ship-shaped hull,
                    Only the following structures that may be associated with a floating platform are subject to the Platform Verification Program:

                (c) If a platform is originally subject to the Platform Verification Program, then the conversion of that platform at that same site for a new purpose, or making a major modification of, or major repair to, that platform, is also subject to the Platform Verification Program. A major modification includes any modification that increases loading on a platform by 10 percent or more. A major repair is a corrective operation involving structural members affecting the structural integrity of a portion or all of the platform. Before you make a major modification or repair to a floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the BSEE and the USCG.
                (d) The applicability of Platform Verification Program requirements to other types of facilities will be determined by BSEE on a case-by-case basis.

Under §§ 250.900(b)(3) and 250.905, you must obtain approval from BSEE before you make major repairs of any damage unless you meet the requirements of § 250.900(c).
              
              
                § 250.920
                What are the BSEE requirements for assessment of fixed platforms?
                (a) You must document all wells, equipment, and pipelines supported by the platform if you intend to use either the A-2 or A-3 assessment category. Assessment categories are defined in API RP 2A-WSD, Section 17.3 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). If BSEE objects to the assessment category you used for your assessment, you may need to redesign and/or modify the platform to adequately demonstrate that the platform is able to withstand the environmental loadings for the appropriate assessment category.
                (b) You must perform an analysis check when your platform will have additional personnel, additional topside facilities, increased environmental or operational loading, inadequate deck height, or suffered significant damage (e.g., experienced damage to primary structural members or conductor guide trays or global structural integrity is adversely affected); or the exposure category changes to a more restrictive level (see Sections 17.2.1 through 17.2.5 of API RP 2A-WSD, incorporated by reference in § 250.198, for a description of assessment initiators).
                (c) You must initiate mitigation actions for platforms that do not pass the assessment process of API RP 2A-WSD. You must submit applications for your mitigation actions (e.g., repair, modification, decommissioning) to the Regional Supervisor for approval before you conduct the work.
                (d) The BSEE may require you to conduct a platform design basis check when the reduced environmental loading criteria contained in API RP 2A-WSD Section 17.6 are not applicable.
                (e) By November 1, 2009, you must submit a complete list of all the platforms you operate, together with all the appropriate data to support the assessment category you assign to each platform and the platform assessment initiators (as defined in API RP 2A-WSD) to the Regional Supervisor. You must submit subsequent complete lists and the appropriate data to support the consequence-of-failure category every 5 years thereafter, or as directed by the Regional Supervisor.
                (f) The use of Section 17, Assessment of Existing Platforms, of API RP 2A-WSD is limited to existing fixed structures that are serving their original approved purpose. You must obtain approval from the Regional Supervisor for any change in purpose of the platform, following the provisions of API RP 2A-WSD, Section 15, Re-use.

                § 250.921
                How do I analyze my platform for cumulative fatigue?
                (a) If you are required to analyze cumulative fatigue on your platform because of the results of an inspection or platform assessment, you must ensure that the safety factors for critical elements listed in § 250.908 are met or exceeded.
                (b) If the calculated life of a joint or member does not meet the criteria of § 250.908, you must either mitigate the load, strengthen the joint or member, or develop an increased inspection process.
              
            
          
          
            
            Subpart J—Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way
            
              § 250.1000
              General requirements.
              (a) Pipelines and associated valves, flanges, and fittings shall be designed, installed, operated, maintained, and abandoned to provide safe and pollution-free transportation of fluids in a manner which does not unduly interfere with other uses in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).
              (b) An application must be accompanied by payment of the service fee listed in § 250.125 and submitted to the Regional Supervisor and approval obtained before:
              (1) Installation, modification, or abandonment of a lease term pipeline;
              (2) Installation or modification of a right-of-way (other than lease term) pipeline; or
              (3) Modification or relinquishment of a pipeline right-of way.
              (c)(1) Department of the Interior (DOI) pipelines, as defined in § 250.1001, must meet the requirements in §§ 250.1000 through 250.1008.
              (2) A pipeline right-of-way grant holder must identify in writing to the Regional Supervisor the operator of any pipeline located on its right-of-way, if the operator is different from the right-of-way grant holder.
              (3) A producing operator must identify for its own records, on all existing pipelines located on its lease or right-of-way, the specific points at which operating responsibility transfers to a transporting operator.
              (i) Each producing operator must, if practical, durably mark all of its above-water transfer points as of the date a pipeline begins service.
              (ii) If it is not practical to durably mark a transfer point, and the transfer point is located above water, then the operator must identify the transfer point on a schematic located on the facility.
              (iii) If a transfer point is located below water, then the operator must identify the transfer point on a schematic and provide the schematic to BSEE upon request.
              (iv) If adjoining producing and transporting operators cannot agree on a transfer point, the BSEE Regional Supervisor and the appropriate Department of Transportation (DOT) pipeline official may jointly determine the transfer point.
              (4) The transfer point serves as a regulatory boundary. An operator may request that the BSEE Regional Supervisor grant an exception to this requirement for an individual facility or area. The Regional Supervisor, in consultation with the appropriate DOT pipeline official and affected parties, may grant the request.
              (5) Pipeline segments designed, constructed, maintained, and operated under DOT regulations but transferring to DOI regulation as of October 16, 1998, may continue to operate under DOT design and construction requirements until significant modifications or repairs are made to those segments. After October 16, 1998, BSEE operational and maintenance requirements will apply to those segments.
              (6) Any producer operating a pipeline that crosses into State waters without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the OCS must comply with this subpart. Compliance must extend from the point where hydrocarbons are first produced, through and including the last valve and associated safety equipment (e.g., pressure safety sensors) on the last production facility on the OCS.
              (7) Any producer operating a pipeline that connects facilities on the OCS must comply with this subpart.
              (8) Any operator of a pipeline that has a valve on the OCS downstream (landward) of the last production facility may ask in writing that the BSEE Regional Supervisor recognize that valve as the last point BSEE will exercise its regulatory authority.
              (9) A pipeline segment is not subject to BSEE regulations for design, construction, operation, and maintenance if:
              (i) It is downstream (generally shoreward) of the last valve and associated safety equipment on the last production facility on the OCS; and
              (ii) It is subject to regulation under 49 CFR parts 192 and 195.

              (10) DOT may inspect all upstream safety equipment (including valves, over-pressure protection devices, cathodic protection equipment, and pigging devices, etc.) that serve to protect the integrity of DOT-regulated pipeline segments.
              (11) OCS pipeline segments not subject to DOT regulation under 49 CFR parts 192 and 195 are subject to all BSEE regulations.
              (12) A producer may request that its pipeline operate under DOT regulations governing pipeline design, construction, operation, and maintenance.
              (i) The operator's request must be in the form of a written petition to the BSEE Regional Supervisor that states the justification for the pipeline to operate under DOT regulation.
              (ii) The Regional Supervisor will decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether to grant the operator's request. In considering each petition, the Regional Supervisor will consult with the appropriate DOT pipeline official.
              (13) A transporter who operates a pipeline regulated by DOT may request to operate under BSEE regulations governing pipeline operation and maintenance. Any subsequent repairs or modifications will also be subject to BSEE regulations governing design and construction.
              (i) The operator's request must be in the form of a written petition to the appropriate DOT pipeline official and the BSEE Regional Supervisor.
              (ii) The BSEE Regional Supervisor and the appropriate DOT pipeline official will decide how to act on this petition.
              (d) A pipeline which qualifies as a right-of-way pipeline (see § 250.1001, Definitions) shall not be installed until a right-of-way has been requested and granted in accordance with this subpart.
              (e)(1) The Regional Supervisor may suspend any pipeline operation upon a determination by the Regional Supervisor that continued activity would threaten or result in serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, mineral deposits, or the marine, coastal, or human environment.
              (2) The Regional Supervisor may also suspend pipeline operations or a right-of-way grant if the Regional Supervisor determines that the lessee or right-of-way holder has failed to comply with a provision of the Act or any other applicable law, a provision of these or other applicable regulations, or a condition of a permit or right-of-way grant.
              (3) The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) may cancel a pipeline permit or right-of-way grant in accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2). A right-of-way grant may be forfeited in accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1334(e).

              (a)(1) Pipelines greater than 85/8 inches in diameter and installed in water depths of less than 200 feet shall be buried to a depth of at least 3 feet unless they are located in pipeline congested areas or seismically active areas as determined by the Regional Supervisor. Nevertheless, the Regional Supervisor may require burial of any pipeline if the Regional Supervisor determines that such burial will reduce the likelihood of environmental degradation or that the pipeline may constitute a hazard to trawling operations or other uses. A trawl test or diver survey may be required to determine whether or not pipeline burial is necessary or to determine whether a pipeline has been properly buried.
              (2) Pipeline valves, taps, tie-ins, capped lines, and repaired sections that could be obstructive shall be provided with at least 3 feet of cover unless the Regional Supervisor determines that such items present no hazard to trawling or other operations. A protective device may be used to cover an obstruction in lieu of burial if it is approved by the Regional Supervisor prior to installation.
              (3) Pipelines shall be installed with a minimum separation of 18 inches at pipeline crossings and from obstructions.
              (4) Pipeline risers installed after April 1, 1988, shall be protected from physical damage that could result from contact with floating vessels. Riser protection on pipelines installed on or before April 1, 1988, may be required when the Regional Supervisor determines that significant damage potential exists.
              (b)(1) Pipelines shall be pressure tested with water at a stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 8 hours when installed, relocated, uprated, or reactivated after being out-of-service for more than 1 year.
              (2) Prior to returning a pipeline to service after a repair, the pipeline shall be pressure tested with water or processed natural gas at a minimum stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 2 hours.

              (3) Pipelines shall not be pressure tested at a pressure which produces a stress in the pipeline in excess of 95 percent of the specified minimum-yield strength of the pipeline. A temperature recorder measuring test fluid temperature synchronized with a pressure recorder along with deadweight test readings shall be employed for all pressure testing. When a pipeline is pressure tested, no observable leakage shall be allowed. Pressure gauges and recorders shall be of sufficient accuracy to verify that leakage is not occurring.
              (4) The Regional Supervisor may require pressure testing of pipelines to verify the integrity of the system when the Regional Supervisor determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the line has been damaged or weakened by external or internal conditions.
              (c) When a pipeline is repaired utilizing a clamp, the clamp shall be a full encirclement clamp able to withstand the anticipated pipeline pressure.

              (ii) For sulphur operations, incoming pipelines delivering gas to the power plant platform may be equipped with high- and low-pressure sensors (PSHL), which activate audible and visual alarms in lieu of requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The PSHL shall be set at 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above and below the normal operating pressure range.
              (2) Incoming pipelines boarding a production platform shall be equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.
              (3) Departing pipelines receiving production from production facilities shall be protected by high- and low-pressure sensors (PSHL) to directly or indirectly shut in all production facilities. The PSHL shall be set not to exceed 15 percent above and below the normal operating pressure range. However, high pilots shall not be set above the pipeline's MAOP.
              (4) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction platforms which do not receive production from the platform shall be equipped with an SDV immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV shall be operated by a PSHL on the departing pipelines and connected to the platform automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.
              (5) The Regional Supervisor may require that oil pipelines be equipped with a metering system to provide a continuous volumetric comparison between the input to the line at the structure(s) and the deliveries onshore. The system shall include an alarm system and shall be of adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and discharge volumes. In lieu of the foregoing, a system capable of detecting leaks in the pipeline may be substituted with the approval of the Regional Supervisor.
              (6) Pipelines incoming to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with a block valve and an FSV. Bidirectional pipelines connected to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with only a block valve.
              (7) Gas-lift or water-injection pipelines on unmanned platforms need only be equipped with an FSV installed immediately upstream of each casing annulus or the first inlet valve on the christmas tree.
              (8) Bidirectional pipelines shall be equipped with a PSHL and an SDV immediately upon boarding each platform.
              (9) Pipeline pumps must comply with section A7 of API RP 14C (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). The setting levels for the PSHL devices are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (c) If the required safety equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an equivalent degree of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.

              (a) The right-of-way holder shall comply with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the grant.
              (b) The granting of the right-of-way shall be subject to the express condition that the rights granted shall not prevent or interfere in any way with the management, administration, or the granting of other rights by the United States, either prior or subsequent to the granting of the right-of-way. Moreover, the holder agrees to allow the occupancy and use by the United States, its lessees, or other right-of-way holders, of any part of the right-of-way grant not actually occupied or necessarily incident to its use for any necessary operations involved in the management, administration, or the enjoyment of such other granted rights.
              (c) If the right-of-way holder discovers any archaeological resource while conducting operations within the right-of-way, the right-of-way holder shall immediately halt operations within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is significant, the Regional Director will inform the right-of-way holder how to protect it.
              (d) The Regional Supervisor shall be kept informed at all times of the right-of-way holder's address and, if a corporation, the address of its principal place of business and the name and address of the officer or agent authorized to be served with process.

              (e) The right-of-way holder shall pay the United States or its lessees or right-of-way holders, as the case may be, the full value of all damages to the property of the United States or its said lessees or right-of-way holders and shall indemnify the United States against any and all liability for damages to life, person, or property arising from the occupation and use of the area covered by the right-of-way grant.
              (f)(1) The holder of a right-of-way oil or gas pipeline shall transport or purchase oil or natural gas produced from submerged lands in the vicinity of the pipeline without discrimination and in such proportionate amounts as the FERC may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to the interested parties, determine to be reasonable, taking into account, among other things, conservation and the prevention of waste.
              (2) Unless otherwise exempted by FERC pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 1334(f)(2), the holder shall:
              (i) Provide open and nondiscriminatory access to a right-of-way pipeline to both owner and nonowner shippers, and
              (ii) Comply with the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 1334(f)(1)(B) under which FERC may order an expansion of the throughput capacity of a right-of-way pipeline which is approved after September 18, 1978, and which is not located in the Gulf of Mexico or the Santa Barbara Channel.
              (g) The area covered by a right-of-way and all improvements thereon shall be kept open at all reasonable times for inspection by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). The right-of-way holder shall make available all records relative to the design, construction, operation, maintenance and repair, and investigations on or with regard to such area.
              (h) Upon relinquishment, forfeiture, or cancellation of a right-of-way grant, the right-of-way holder shall remove all platforms, structures, domes over valves, pipes, taps, and valves along the right-of-way. All of these improvements shall be removed by the holder within 1 year of the effective date of the relinquishment, forfeiture, or cancellation unless this requirement is waived in writing by the Regional Supervisor. All such improvements not removed within the time provided herein shall become the property of the United States but that shall not relieve the holder of liability for the cost of their removal or for restoration of the site. Furthermore, the holder is responsible for accidents or damages which might occur as a result of failure to timely remove improvements and equipment and restore a site. An application for relinquishment of a right-of-way grant shall be filed in accordance with § 250.1019 of this part.

              § 250.1016
              Granting pipeline rights-of-way.
              (a) In considering an application for a right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the potential effect of the associated pipeline on the human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), property, and mineral resources in the entire area during construction and operational phases. The Regional Supervisor shall prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines. To aid in the evaluation and determinations, the Regional Supervisor may request and consider views and recommendations of appropriate Federal Agencies, hold public meetings after appropriate notice, and consult, as appropriate, with State agencies, organizations, industries, and individuals. Before granting a pipeline right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall give consideration to any recommendation by the intergovernmental planning program, or similar process, for the assessment and management of OCS oil and gas transportation.
              (b) Should the proposed route of a right-of-way adjoin and subsequently cross any State submerged lands, the applicant shall submit evidence to the Regional Supervisor that the State(s) so affected has reviewed the application. The applicant shall also submit any comment received as a result of that review. In the event of a State recommendation to relocate the proposed route, the Regional Supervisor may consult with the appropriate State officials.
              (c)(1) The applicant shall submit photocopies of return receipts to the Regional Supervisor that indicate the date that each lessee or right-of-way holder referenced in § 250.1015(c) of this part has received a copy of the application. Letters of no objection may be submitted in lieu of the return receipts.
              (2) The Regional Supervisor shall not take final action on a right-of-way application until the Regional Supervisor is satisfied that each such lessee or right-of-way holder has been afforded at least 30 days from the date determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which to submit comments.
              (d) If a proposed right-of-way crosses any lands not subject to disposition by mineral leasing or restricted from oil and gas activities, it shall be rejected by the Regional Supervisor unless the Federal Agency with jurisdiction over such excluded or restricted area gives its consent to the granting of the right-of-way. In such case, the applicant, upon a request filed within 30 days after receipt of the notification of such rejection, shall be allowed an opportunity to eliminate the conflict.
              (e)(1) If the application and other required information are found to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the right-of-way may be granted. The Regional Supervisor may prescribe, as conditions to the right-of-way grant, stipulations necessary to protect human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), property, and mineral resources located on or adjacent to the right-of-way.
              (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a change in the application should be made, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the applicant that an amended application shall be filed subject to stipulated changes. The Regional Supervisor shall determine whether the applicant shall deliver copies of the amended application to other parties for comment.
              (3) A decision to reject an application shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the rejection.
            
            
              § 250.1017
              Requirements for construction under pipeline right-of-way grants.

              (a) Failure to construct the associated right-of-way pipeline within 5 years of the date of the granting of a right-of-way shall cause the grant to expire.
              (b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the right-of-way as granted.
              (2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall—
              (i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-way grants in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the date of the acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of pipeline construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with evidence of such notification; and
              (ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.
              (3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed from the proposed right-of-way as granted may be grounds for forfeiture of the right-of-way.
              (c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.

              General
              
                § 250.1150
                What are the general reservoir production requirements?
                You must produce wells and reservoirs at rates that provide for economic development while maximizing ultimate recovery and without adversely affecting correlative rights.
              
            
            
              Well Tests and Surveys
              
                § 250.1151
                How often must I conduct well production tests?
                (a) You must conduct well production tests as shown in the following table:
                
                  
                    You must conduct:
                    And you must submit to the Regional Supervisor:
                  
                  
                    (1) A well-flow potential test on all new, recompleted, or reworked well completions within 30 days of the date of first continuous production,
                    Form BSEE-0126, Well Potential Test Report, along with the supporting data as listed in the table in § 250.1167, within 15 days after the end of the test period.
                  
                  
                    
                    (2) At least one well test during a calendar half-year for each producing completion,
                    Results on Form BSEE-0128, Semiannual Well Test Report, of the most recent well test obtained. This must be submitted within 45 days after the end of the calendar half-year.
                  
                
                (b) You may request an extension from the Regional Supervisor if you cannot submit the results of a semiannual well test within the specified time.

                § 250.1152
                How do I conduct well tests?
                (a) When you conduct well tests you must:
                (1) Recover fluid from the well completion equivalent to the amount of fluid introduced into the formation during completion, recompletion, reworking, or treatment operations before you start a well test;
                (2) Produce the well completion under stabilized rate conditions for at least 6 consecutive hours before beginning the test period;
                (3) Conduct the test for at least 4 consecutive hours;
                (4) Adjust measured gas volumes to the standard conditions of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) and 60 °F for all tests; and
                (5) Use measured specific gravity values to calculate gas volumes.
                (b) You may request approval from the Regional Supervisor to conduct a well test using alternative procedures if you can demonstrate test reliability under those procedures.
                (c) The Regional Supervisor may also require you to conduct the following tests and complete them within a specified time period:
                (1) A retest or a prolonged test of a well completion if it is determined to be necessary for the proper establishment of a Maximum Production Rate (MPR) or a Maximum Efficient Rate (MER); and
                (2) A multipoint back-pressure test to determine the theoretical open-flow potential of a gas well.
                (d) A BSEE representative may witness any well test. Upon request, you must provide advance notice to the Regional Supervisor of the times and dates of well tests.
              
              
                §§ 250.1153-250.1155
                [Reserved]
              
            
            
              Approvals Prior to Production
              
                § 250.1156
                What steps must I take to receive approval to produce within 500 feet of a unit or lease line?
                (a) You must obtain approval from the Regional Supervisor before you start producing from a reservoir within a well that has any portion of the completed interval less than 500 feet from a unit or lease line. Submit to BSEE the service fee listed in § 250.125, according to the instructions in § 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 250.1167, with your request. The Regional Supervisor will determine whether approval of your request will maximize ultimate recovery, avoid the waste of natural resources, or protect correlative rights. You do not need to obtain approval if the adjacent leases or units have the same unit, lease (record title and operating rights), and royalty interests as the lease or unit you plan to produce. You do not need to obtain approval if the adjacent block is unleased.

                (b) You must notify the operator(s) of adjacent property(ies) that are within 500 feet of the completion, if the adjacent acreage is a leased block in the Federal OCS. You must provide the Regional Supervisor proof of the date of the notification. The operators of the adjacent properties have 30 days after receiving the notification to provide the Regional Supervisor letters of acceptance or objection. If an adjacent operator does not respond within 30 days, the Regional Supervisor will presume there are no objections and proceed with a decision. The notification must include:
                (1) The well name;
                (2) The rectangular coordinates (x, y) of the location of the top and bottom of the completion or target completion referenced to the North American Datum 1983, and the subsea depths of the top and bottom of the completion or target completion;
                (3) The distance from the completion or target completion to the unit or lease line at its nearest point; and
                (4) A statement indicating whether or not it will be a high-capacity completion having a perforated or open hole interval greater than 150 feet measured depth.
              
              
                § 250.1157
                How do I receive approval to produce gas-cap gas from an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap?
                (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor:
                (1) Before producing gas-cap gas from each completion in an oil reservoir that is known to have an associated gas cap.
                (2) To continue production from a well if the oil reservoir is not initially known to have an associated gas cap, but the oil well begins to show characteristics of a gas well.
                (b) For either request, you must submit the service fee listed in § 250.125, according to the instructions in § 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 250.1167, with your request.
                (c) The Regional Supervisor will determine whether your request maximizes ultimate recovery.
              
              
                § 250.1158
                How do I receive approval to downhole commingle hydrocarbons?
                (a) Before you perforate a well, you must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to commingle hydrocarbons produced from multiple reservoirs within a common wellbore. The Regional Supervisor will determine whether your request maximizes ultimate recovery. You must include the service fee listed in § 250.125, according to the instructions in § 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 250.1167, with your request.
                (b) If one or more of the reservoirs proposed for commingling is a competitive reservoir, you must notify the operators of all leases that contain the reservoir that you intend to downhole commingle the reservoirs. Your request for approval of downhole commingling must include proof of the date of this notification. The notified operators have 30 days after notification to provide the Regional Supervisor with letters of acceptance or objection. If the notified operators do not respond within the specified period, the Regional Supervisor will assume the operators do not object and proceed with a decision.
              
            
            
              Production Rates
              
                § 250.1159
                May the Regional Supervisor limit my well or reservoir production rates?
                (a) The Regional Supervisor may set a Maximum Production Rate (MPR) for a producing well completion, or set a Maximum Efficient Rate (MER) for a reservoir, or both, if the Regional Supervisor determines that an excessive production rate could harm ultimate recovery. An MPR or MER will be based on well tests and any limitations imposed by well and surface equipment, sand production, reservoir sensitivity, gas-oil and water-oil ratios, location of perforated intervals, and prudent operating practices.
                (b) If the Regional Supervisor sets an MPR for a producing well completion and/or an MER for a reservoir, you may not exceed those rates except due to normal variations and fluctuations in production rates as set by the Regional Supervisor.
              
            
            
              Flaring, Venting, and Burning Hydrocarbons
              
                § 250.1160
                When may I flare or vent gas?

                (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to flare or vent natural gas at your facility, except in the following situations:
                
                
                  
                    Condition
                    Additional requirements
                  
                  
                    (1) When the gas is lease use gas (produced natural gas which is used on or for the benefit of lease operations such as gas used to operate production facilities) or is used as an additive necessary to burn waste products, such as H2S
                    The volume of gas flared or vented may not exceed the amount necessary for its intended purpose. Burning waste products may require approval under other regulations.
                  
                  
                    (2) During the restart of a facility that was shut in because of weather conditions, such as a hurricane
                    Flaring or venting may not exceed 48 cumulative hours without Regional Supervisor approval.
                  
                  
                    (3) During the blow down of transportation pipelines downstream of the royalty meter
                    (i) You must report the location, time, flare/vent volume, and reason for flaring/venting to the Regional Supervisor in writing within 72 hours after the incident is over.(ii) Additional approval may be required under subparts H and J of this part.
                    
                  
                  
                    (4) During the unloading or cleaning of a well, drill-stem testing, production testing, other well-evaluation testing, or the necessary blow down to perform these procedures
                    You may not exceed 48 cumulative hours of flaring or venting per unloading or cleaning or testing operation on a single completion without Regional Supervisor approval.
                  
                  
                    (5) When properly working equipment yields flash gas (natural gas released from liquid hydrocarbons as a result of a decrease in pressure, an increase in temperature, or both) from storage vessels or other low-pressure production vessels, and you cannot economically recover this flash gas
                    You may not flare or vent more than an average of 50 MCF per day during any calendar month without Regional Supervisor approval.
                  
                  
                    (6) When the equipment works properly but there is a temporary upset condition, such as a hydrate or paraffin plug
                    (i) For oil-well gas and gas-well flash gas (natural gas released from condensate as a result of a decrease in pressure, an increase in temperature, or both), you may not exceed 48 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.(ii) For primary gas-well gas (natural gas from a gas well completion that is at or near its wellhead pressure; this does not include flash gas), you may not exceed 2 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.
                      (iii) You may not exceed 144 cumulative hours of flaring or venting during a calendar month without Regional Supervisor approval.
                    
                  
                  
                    (7) When equipment fails to work properly, during equipment maintenance and repair, or when you must relieve system pressures
                    (i) For oil-well gas and gas-well flash gas, you may not exceed 48 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.(ii) For primary gas-well gas, you may not exceed 2 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.
                      (iii) You may not exceed 144 cumulative hours of flaring or venting during a calendar month without Regional Supervisor approval.
                      (iv) The continuous and cumulative hours allowed under this paragraph may be counted separately from the hours under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
                    
                  
                
                (b) Regardless of the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, you must not flare or vent gas over the volume approved in your Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or your Development and Production Plan (DPP) submitted to BOEM.
                (c) The Regional Supervisor may establish alternative approval procedures to cover situations when you cannot contact the BSEE office, such as during non-office hours.
                (d) The Regional Supervisor may specify a volume limit, or a shorter time limit than specified elsewhere in this part, in order to prevent air quality degradation or loss of reserves.
                (e) If you flare or vent gas without the required approval, or if the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or could have avoided flaring or venting the gas, the hydrocarbons will be considered avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss or waste, according to 30 CFR part 1202. You must value any gas or liquid hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of 30 CFR part 1206.
                (f) Fugitive emissions from valves, fittings, flanges, pressure relief valves or similar components do not require approval under this subpart unless specifically required by the Regional Supervisor.
              
              
                § 250.1161
                When may I flare or vent gas for extended periods of time?

                You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to flare or vent gas for an extended period of time. The Regional Supervisor will specify the approved period of time, which will not exceed 1 year. The Regional Supervisor may deny your request if it does not ensure the conservation of natural resources or is not consistent with National interests relating to development and production of minerals of the OCS. The Regional Supervisor may approve your request for one of the following reasons:
                (a) You initiated an action which, when completed, will eliminate flaring and venting; or
                (b) You submit to the Regional Supervisor an evaluation supported by engineering, geologic, and economic data indicating that the oil and gas produced from the well(s) will not economically support the facilities necessary to sell the gas or to use the gas on or for the benefit of the lease.
              
              
                § 250.1162
                When may I burn produced liquid hydrocarbons?
                (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to burn any produced liquid hydrocarbons. The Regional Supervisor may allow you to burn liquid hydrocarbons if you demonstrate that transporting them to market or re-injecting them is not technically feasible or poses a significant risk of harm to offshore personnel or the environment.
                (b) If you burn liquid hydrocarbons without the required approval, or if the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or could have avoided burning liquid hydrocarbons, the hydrocarbons will be considered avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss or waste, according to 30 CFR part 1202. You must value any liquid hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of 30 CFR part 1206.
              
              
                § 250.1163
                How must I measure gas flaring or venting volumes and liquid hydrocarbon burning volumes, and what records must I maintain?
                (a) If your facility processes more than an average of 2,000 bopd during May 2010, you must install flare/vent meters within 180 days after May 2010. If your facility processes more than an average of 2,000 bopd during a calendar month after May 2010, you must install flare/vent meters within 120 days after the end of the month in which the average amount of oil processed exceeds 2,000 bopd.
                (1) You must notify the Regional Supervisor when your facility begins to process more than an average of 2,000 bopd in a calendar month;
                (2) The flare/vent meters must measure all flared and vented gas within 5 percent accuracy;
                (3) You must calibrate the meters regularly, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation, or at least once every year, whichever is shorter; and
                (4) You must use and maintain the flare/vent meters for the life of the facility.
                (b) You must report all hydrocarbons produced from a well completion, including all gas flared, gas vented, and liquid hydrocarbons burned, to Office of Natural Resources Revenue on Form ONRR-4054 (Oil and Gas Operations Report), in accordance with 30 CFR 1210.102.
                (1) You must report the amount of gas flared and the amount of gas vented separately.
                (2) You may classify and report gas used to operate equipment on the lease, such as gas used to power engines, instrument gas, and gas used to maintain pilot lights, as lease use gas.
                (3) If flare/vent meters are required at one or more of your facilities, you must report the amount of gas flared and vented at each of those facilities separately from those facilities that do not require meters and separately from other facilities with meters.
                (4) If flare/vent meters are not required at your facility:
                (i) You may report the gas flared and vented on a lease or unit basis. Gas flared and vented from multiple facilities on a single lease or unit may be reported together.
                (ii) If you choose to install meters, you may report the gas volume flared and vented according to the method specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
                (c) You must prepare and maintain records detailing gas flaring, gas venting, and liquid hydrocarbon burning for each facility for 6 years.

                (1) You must maintain these records on the facility for at least the first 2 years and have them available for inspection by BSEE representatives.
                (2) After 2 years, you must maintain the records, allow BSEE representatives to inspect the records upon request and provide copies to the Regional Supervisor upon request, but are not required to keep them on the facility.
                (3) The records must include, at a minimum:
                (i) Daily volumes of gas flared, gas vented, and liquid hydrocarbons burned;
                (ii) Number of hours of gas flaring, gas venting, and liquid hydrocarbon burning, on a daily and monthly cumulative basis;
                (iii) A list of the wells contributing to gas flaring, gas venting, and liquid hydrocarbon burning, along with gas-oil ratio data;
                (iv) Reasons for gas flaring, gas venting, and liquid hydrocarbon burning; and
                (v) Documentation of all required approvals.
                (d) If your facility is required to have flare/vent meters:
                (1) You must maintain the meter recordings for 6 years.
                (i) You must keep these recordings on the facility for 2 years and have them available for inspection by BSEE representatives.
                (ii) After 2 years, you must maintain the recordings, allow BSEE representatives to inspect the recordings upon request and provide copies to the Regional Supervisor upon request, but are not required to keep them on the facility.
                (iii) These recordings must include the begin times, end times, and volumes for all flaring and venting incidents.
                (2) You must maintain flare/vent meter calibration and maintenance records on the facility for 2 years.
                (e) If your flaring or venting of gas, or burning of liquid hydrocarbons, required written or oral approval, you must submit documentation to the Regional Supervisor summarizing the location, dates, number of hours, and volumes of gas flared, gas vented, and liquid hydrocarbons burned under the approval.
              
              
                § 250.1164
                What are the requirements for flaring or venting gas containing H 2S?
                (a) You may not vent gas containing H2S, except for minor releases during maintenance and repair activities that do not result in a 15-minute time-weighted average atmosphere concentration of H2S of 20 ppm or higher anywhere on the platform.
                (b) You may flare gas containing H2S only if you meet the requirements of §§ 250.1160, 250.1161, 250.1163, and the following additional requirements:

                (1) For safety or air pollution prevention purposes, the Regional Supervisor may further restrict the flaring of gas containing H2S. The Regional Supervisor will use information provided in the lessee's H2S Contingency Plan (§ 250.490(f)), Exploration Plan, DPP, DOCD submitted to BOEM, and associated documents to determine the need for restrictions; and
                (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that flaring at a facility or group of facilities may significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area, the Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct an air quality modeling analysis, under 30 CFR 550.303, to determine the potential effect of facility emissions. The Regional Supervisor may require monitoring and reporting, or may restrict or prohibit flaring, under 30 CFR 550.303 and 30 CFR 550.304.

                (c) The Regional Supervisor may require you to submit monthly reports of flared and vented gas containing H2S. Each report must contain, on a daily basis:

                § 250.1165
                What must I do for enhanced recovery operations?

                (a) You must promptly initiate enhanced oil and gas recovery operations for all reservoirs where these operations would result in an increase in ultimate recovery of oil or gas under sound engineering and economic principles.
                
                (b) Before initiating enhanced recovery operations, you must submit a proposed plan to the BSEE Regional Supervisor and receive approval for pressure maintenance, secondary or tertiary recovery, cycling, and similar recovery operations intended to increase the ultimate recovery of oil and gas from a reservoir. The proposed plan must include, for each project reservoir, a geologic and engineering overview and any additional information required by the BSEE Regional Supervisor. You also must submit Form BOEM-0127 to BOEM along with the supporting data specified in BOEM regulations, 30 CFR part 550, subpart K.
                (c) You must report to Office of Natural Resources Revenue the volumes of oil, gas, or other substances injected, produced, or produced for a second time under 30 CFR 1210.102.

                § 250.1166
                What additional reporting is required for developments in the Alaska OCS Region?
                (a) For any development in the Alaska OCS Region, you must submit an annual reservoir management report to the Regional Supervisor. The report must contain information detailing the activities performed during the previous year and planned for the upcoming year that will:
                (1) Provide for the prevention of waste;
                (2) Provide for the protection of correlative rights; and
                (3) Maximize ultimate recovery of oil and gas.
                (b) If your development is jointly regulated by BSEE and the State of Alaska, BSEE and the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will jointly determine appropriate reporting requirements to minimize or eliminate duplicate reporting requirements.

            Subpart M—Unitization
            
              § 250.1300
              What is the purpose of this subpart?
              This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose of joint development and unitization is to:
              (a) Conserve natural resources;
              (b) Prevent waste; and/or
              (c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.
            
            
              § 250.1301
              What are the requirements for unitization?
              (a) Voluntary unitization. You and other OCS lessees may ask the Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if unitized operations:
              (1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or
              (2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir.
              (b) Compulsory unitization. The Regional Supervisor may require you and other lessees to unitize operations of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir if unitized operations are necessary to:
              (1) Prevent waste;
              (2) Conserve natural resources; or
              (3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.
              (c) Unit area. The area that a unit includes is the minimum number of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations common to two or more leases. A unit may include whole leases or portions of leases.
              (d) Unit agreement. You, the other lessees, and the unit operator must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations (§ 250.180) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor orders or approves a suspension of production under § 250.170.
              
              (e) Unit operating agreement. The unit operator and the owners of working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to approve the unit operating agreement.
              (f) Extension of a lease covered by unit operations. If your unit agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease expires unless:
              (1) Its initial term has not expired;
              (2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or
              (3) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of production or operations for your lease.
              (g) Unit operations. If your lease, or any part of your lease, is subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your lease remains part of the unit area, and as long as operations continue the unit in effect.
              (1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any extension under § 250.180, the unit operator must request and obtain BSEE approval of a suspension of production under § 250.170 in order to keep the unit from terminating.
              (2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:
              (i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or
              (ii) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of operations under § 250.170.
            
            
              § 250.1302
              What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?
              (a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program submitted to BSEE or a unitization agreement. A competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and which is shut in at the well head or at the surface but not necessarily connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans future production.
              (b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.

              (c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir determined competitive by the BSEE Regional Supervisor, you and the other affected lessees must submit for approval a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program. You must submit the joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program within 90 days after the Regional Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is competitive. The joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program must provide for the development and/or production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental Competitive Reservoir Development Programs for the Regional Supervisor's approval.
              (d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement on a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program, submitted to BSEE within the approved period of time, each lessee must submit a separate Competitive Reservoir Development Program to the Regional Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve differences in the separate Competitive Reservoir Development Programs. If the differences in the separate programs are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization is necessary under § 250.1301(b), BSEE will initiate unitization under § 250.1304.

              § 250.1303
              How do I apply for voluntary unitization?
              (a) You must file a request for a voluntary unit with the Regional Supervisor. Your request must include:
              (1) A draft of the proposed unit agreement;
              (2) A proposed initial plan of operation;
              (3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and
              (4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the unitization proposal meets the criteria of § 250.1300.

              (b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this part. BSEE will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to follow. If BSEE revises the model, BSEE will publish the revised model in the Federal Register. If you vary your unit agreement from the model agreement, you must obtain the approval of the Regional Supervisor.
              (c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.
              (d) You must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 of this part with your request for a voluntary unitization proposal or the expansion of a previously approved voluntary unit to include additional acreage. Additionally, you must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 with your request for unitization revision.
            
            
              § 250.1304
              How will BSEE require unitization?
              (a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require unitization.
              (b) If you ask BSEE to require unitization, you must file a request with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement as described in §§ 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of § 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting lessees copies of:
              (1) The request;
              (2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;
              (3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and
              (4) The proposed initial plan of operation.
              (c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, BSEE will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed unitization.

              (d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until BSEE provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an opportunity for a hearing. If you want BSEE to hold a hearing, you must request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for compulsory unitization from another lessee.
              (e) BSEE will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 30 days after BSEE provides written notice of the hearing date to all parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.
              (f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.

                § 250.1409
                What are my appeal rights?
                (a) When you receive the Reviewing Officer's final decision, you have 60 days to either pay the penalty or file an appeal in accordance with 30 CFR part 290, subpart A.
                (b) If you file an appeal, you must either:
                (1) Submit a surety bond in the amount of the penalty to the appropriate Leasing Office in the Region where the penalty was assessed, following instructions that the Reviewing Officer will include in the final decision; or
                (2) Notify the appropriate Leasing Office, in the Region where the penalty was assessed, that you want your lease-specific/area-wide bond on file to be used as the bond for the penalty amount.

                (c) If you choose the alternative in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the BOEM Regional Director may require additional security (i.e., security in excess of your existing bond) to ensure sufficient coverage during an appeal. In that event, the Regional Director will require you to post the supplemental bond with the regional office in the same manner as under 30 CFR 556.53(d) through (f). If the Regional Director determines the appeal should be covered by a lease-specific abandonment account then you must establish an account that meets the requirements of 30 CFR part 556.56.
                (d) If you do not either pay the penalty or file a timely appeal, BSEE will take one or more of the following actions:
                (1) We will collect the amount you were assessed, plus interest, late payment charges, and other fees as provided by law, from the date you received the Reviewing Officer's final decision until the date we receive payment;
                (2) We may initiate additional enforcement, including, if appropriate, cancellation of the lease, right-of-way, license, permit, or approval, or the forfeiture of a bond under this part; or
                (3) We may bar you from doing further business with the Federal Government according to Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, 31 U.S.C. 6101. The Department of the Interior's regulations implementing these authorities are found at 43 CFR part 12, subpart D.

              (b) Hydrogen sulfide (H
                2
                S). When a drilling, well-completion, well-workover, or production operation is being conducted on a well in zones known to contain H2S or in zones where the presence of H2S is unknown (as defined in § 250.490 of this part), the lessee shall take appropriate precautions to protect life and property, especially during operations such as dismantling wellhead equipment and flow lines and circulating the well. The lessee shall also take appropriate precautions when H2S is generated as a result of sulphur production operations. The lessee shall comply with the requirements in § 250.490 of this part as well as the requirements of this subpart.
              (c) Welding and burning practices and procedures. All welding, burning, and hot-tapping activities involved in drilling, well-completion, well-workover or production operations shall be conducted with properly maintained equipment, trained personnel, and appropriate procedures in order to minimize the danger to life and property according to the specific requirements in §§ 250.109 through 250.113 of this part.
              (d) Electrical requirements. All electrical equipment and systems involved in drilling, well-completion, well-workover, and production operations shall be designed, installed, equipped, protected, operated, and maintained so as to minimize the danger to life and property in accordance with the requirements of § 250.114 of this part.
              (e) Structures on fixed OCS platforms. Derricks, cranes, masts, substructures, and related equipment shall be selected, designed, installed, used, and maintained so as to be adequate for the potential loads and conditions of loading that may be encountered during the operations. Prior to moving equipment such as a well-drilling, well-completion, or well-workover rig or associated equipment or production equipment onto a platform, the lessee shall determine the structural capability of the platform to safely support the equipment and operations, taking into consideration corrosion protection, platform age, and previous stresses.
              (f) Traveling-block safety device. All drilling units being used for drilling, well-completion, or well-workover operations that have both a traveling block and a crown block must be equipped with a safety device that is designed to prevent the traveling block from striking the crown block. The device must be checked for proper operation weekly and after each drill-line slipping operation. The results of the operational check must be entered in the operations log.
            
            
              § 250.1605
              Drilling requirements.
              (a) Sulphur leases. Lessees of OCS sulphur leases shall conduct drilling operations in accordance with §§ 250.1605 through 250.1619 of this subpart and with other requirements of this part, as appropriate.
              (b) Fitness of drilling unit. (1) Drilling units shall be capable of withstanding the oceanographic and meteorological conditions for the proposed season and location of operations.
              (2) Prior to commencing operation, drilling units shall be made available for a complete inspection by the District Manager.
              (3) The lessee shall provide information and data on the fitness of the drilling unit to perform the proposed drilling operation. The information shall be submitted with, or prior to, the submission of Form BSEE-0123, Application for Permit to Drill (APD), in accordance with § 250.1617 of this subpart. After a drilling unit has been approved by a BSEE district office, the information required in this paragraph need not be resubmitted unless required by the District Manager or there are changes in the equipment that affect the rated capacity of the unit.
              (c) Oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance data. Where oceanographic, meteorological, and drilling unit performance data are not otherwise readily available, lessees shall collect and report such data upon request to the District Manager. The type of information to be collected and reported will be determined by the District Manager in the interests of safety in the conduct of operations and the structural integrity of the drilling unit.
              (d) Foundation requirements. When the lessee fails to provide sufficient information pursuant to 30 CFR 550.211 through 550.228 and 30 CFR 550.241 through 550.262 to support a determination that the seafloor is capable of supporting a specific bottom-founded drilling unit under the site-specific soil and oceanographic conditions, the District Manager may require that additional surveys and soil borings be performed and the results submitted for review and evaluation by the District Manager before approval is granted for commencing drilling operations.
              (e) Tests, surveys, and samples. (1) Lessees shall drill and take cores and/or run well and mud logs through the objective interval to determine the presence, quality, and quantity of sulphur and other minerals (e.g., oil and gas) in the cap rock and the outline of the commercial sulphur deposit.
              (2) Inclinational surveys shall be obtained on all vertical wells at intervals not exceeding 1,000 feet during the normal course of drilling. Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be obtained on all directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 500 feet during the normal course of drilling and at intervals not exceeding 200 feet in all planned angle-change portions of the borehole.
              (3) Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be obtained on both vertically and directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 500 feet prior to or upon setting a string of casing, or production liner, and at total depth. Composite directional surveys shall be prepared with the interval shown from the bottom of the conductor casing. In calculating all surveys, a correction from the true north to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north shall be made after making the magnetic-to-true-north correction. A composite dipmeter directional survey or a composite measurement while-drilling directional survey will be acceptable as fulfilling the applicable requirements of this paragraph.
              (4) Wells are classified as vertical if the calculated average of inclination readings weighted by the respective interval lengths between readings from surface to drilled depth does not exceed 3 degrees from the vertical. When the calculated average inclination readings weighted by the length of the respective interval between readings from the surface to drilled depth exceeds 3 degrees, the well is classified as directional.
              (5) At the request of a holder of an adjoining lease, the Regional Supervisor may, for the protection of correlative rights, furnish a copy of the directional survey to that leaseholder.
              (f) Fixed drilling platforms. Applications for installation of fixed drilling platforms or structures including artificial islands shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of subpart I, Platforms and Structures, of this part. Mobile drilling units that have their jacking equipment removed or have been otherwise immobilized are classified as fixed bottom founded drilling platforms.
              (g) Crane operations. You must operate a crane installed on fixed platforms according to § 250.108 of this subpart.
              (h) Diesel-engine air intakes. Diesel-engine air intakes must be equipped with a device to shut down the diesel engine in the event of runaway. Diesel engines that are continuously attended must be equipped with either remote-operated manual or automatic-shutdown devices.

              § 250.1606
              Control of wells.
              The lessee shall take necessary precautions to keep its wells under control at all times. Operations shall be conducted in a safe and workmanlike manner. The lessee shall utilize the best available and safest drilling technologies and state-of-the-art methods to evaluate and minimize the potential for a well to flow or kick. The lessee shall utilize personnel who are trained and competent and shall utilize and maintain equipment and materials necessary to assure the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment.
            
            
              
              § 250.1607
              Field rules.
              When geological and engineering information in a field enables a District Manager to determine specific operating requirements, field rules may be established for drilling, well completion, or well workover on the District Manager's initiative or in response to a request from a lessee; such rules may modify the specific requirements of this subpart. After field rules have been established, operations in the field shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and other requirements of this subpart. Field rules may be amended or canceled for cause at any time upon the initiative of the District Manager or upon the request of a lessee.
            
            
              § 250.1608
              Well casing and cementing.
              (a) General requirements. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the several casing strings in order of normal installation are:
              (i) Drive or structural,
              (ii) Conductor,
              (iii) Cap rock casing,
              (iv) Bobtail cap rock casing (required when the cap rock casing does not penetrate into the cap rock),
              (v) Second cap rock casing (brine wells), and
              (vi) Production liner.
              (2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).
              (3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and to assure safe operations for the life of the well.
              (4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing removal upon well abandonment if the District Manager determines that subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not jeopardized.
              (5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by pressure testing the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate cementing, the lessee shall initiate remedial action as approved by the District Manager. For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of cementing shall be the pressure testing of the annulus between the cap rock and the conductor casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent of the burst pressure of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the collapse pressure of the cap rock casing.
              (b) Drive or structural casing. This casing shall be set by driving, jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District Manager, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular space back to the mud line shall be used.
              (c) Conductor and cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements. (1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, subject to District Manager approval, to permit the casing to be set in a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to be isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the District Manager for approval.
              (2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line. Cement fill shall be verified by the observation of cement returns. In the event that observation of cement returns is not feasible, additional quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill to the mud line.
              (3) Cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the conductor casing. When geologic conditions such as near surface fractures and faulting exist, cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to the mud line, unless otherwise approved by the District Manager. In brine wells, the second cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet above the setting depth of the first cap rock casing.
              (d) Bobtail cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements. (1) Bobtail cap rock casing shall be set on or just in cap rock and lapped a minimum of 100 feet into the previous casing string.
              (2) Sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of the bobtail cap rock casing.
              (e) Production liner setting and cementing requirements. (1) Production liners for sulphur wells and bleedwells shall be set in cap rock at or above the bottom of the open hole (hole that is open in cap rock, below the bottom of the cap rock casing) and lapped into the previous casing string or to the surface. For brine wells, the liner shall be set in salt and lapped into the previous casing string or to the surface.
              (2) The production liner is not required to be cemented unless the cap rock contains oil or gas. If the cap rock contains oil or gas, sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of the production liner.
            
            
              § 250.1609
              Pressure testing of casing.
              (a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, except the drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested. The conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not be subject to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in 30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run and the casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated until a satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, and results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the driller's report.
              (b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a time lapse of at least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.

                (4) You must attach a dual check valve assembly to the coiled tubing connector at the downhole end of the coiled tubing string for all coiled tubing well abandonment operations. If you plan to conduct operations without downhole check valves, you must describe alternate procedures and equipment in Form BSEE-0124, Application for Permit to Modify, and have it approved by the BSEE District Manager.
                (5) You must have a kill line and a separate choke line. You must equip each line with two full-opening valves and at least one of the valves must be remotely controlled. You may use a manual valve instead of the remotely controlled valve on the kill line if you install a check valve between the two full-opening manual valves and the pump or manifold. The valves must have a working pressure rating equal to or greater than the working pressure rating of the connection to which they are attached, and you must install them between the well-control stack and the choke or kill line. For operations with expected surface pressures greater than 3,500 psi, the kill line must be connected to a pump or manifold. You must not use the kill line inlet on the BOP stack for taking fluid returns from the wellbore.
                (6) You must have a hydraulic-actuating system that provides sufficient accumulator capacity to close-open-close each component in the BOP stack. This cycle must be completed with at least 200 psi above the pre-charge pressure, without assistance from a charging system.
                (7) All connections used in the surface BOP system from the tree to the uppermost required ram must be flanged, including the connections between the well-control stack and the first full-opening valve on the choke line and the kill line.

                (b) The minimum BOP system components for well abandonment operations with the tree in place and performed by moving tubing or drill pipe in or out of a well under pressure utilizing equipment specifically designed for that purpose, i.e., snubbing operations, must include the following:
                (1) One set of pipe rams hydraulically operated, and
                (2) Two sets of stripper-type pipe rams hydraulically operated with spacer spool.
                (c) An inside BOP or a spring-loaded, back-pressure safety valve, and an essentially full-opening, work-string safety valve in the open position must be maintained on the rig floor at all times during well abandonment operations when the tree is removed or during well abandonment operations with the tree installed and using small tubing as the work string. A wrench to fit the work-string safety valve must be readily available. Proper connections must be readily available for inserting valves in the work string. The full-opening safety valve is not required for coiled tubing or snubbing operations.

              (3) You should assure that the recommendations in the hazards analysis are resolved and that the resolution is documented.
              (4) A single hazards analysis can be performed to fulfill the requirements for simple and nearly identical facilities, such as well jackets and single well caissons. You can apply this single hazards analysis to simple and nearly identical facilities after you verify that any site-specific deviations are addressed in each of your SEMS program elements.
              (b) JSA. You must ensure a JSA is prepared, conducted, and approved for OCS activities that are identified or discussed in your SEMS program. The JSA is a technique used to identify risks to personnel associated with their job activities. The JSAs are also used to determine the appropriate mitigation measures needed to reduce job risks to personnel. The JSA must include all personnel involved with the job activity.
              (1) You must ensure that your JSA identifies, analyzes, and records:
              (i) The steps involved in performing a specific job;
              (ii) The existing or potential safety, health, and environmental hazards associated with each step; and

Refer to § 254.6 for the definitions of oil, facility, and coast line if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.
              (b) You must maintain a current OSRP for an abandoned facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until the Chief, Oil Spill Preparedness Division (OSPD) notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer required.
              (c) Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan for a pipeline that carries:
              (1) Oil;
              (2) Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or
              (3) Gas and naturally occurring condensate.
              (d) If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Chief, OSPD.
              (e) If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it should be regulated by BSEE, you may contact the Chief, OSPD, offer to accept BSEE jurisdiction over your facility, and request that BSEE seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a relinquishment of that jurisdiction.

              § 254.2
              When must I submit an OSRP?

              (a) You must submit, and BSEE must approve, an OSRP that covers each facility located seaward of the coast line before you may use that facility. To continue operations, you must operate the facility in compliance with the OSRP.
              (b) Despite the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you may operate your facility after you submit your OSRP while BSEE reviews it for approval. To operate a facility without an approved OSRP, you must certify in writing to the Chief, OSPD that you have the capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge. The certification must show that you have ensured by contract, or other means approved by the Chief, OSPD, the availability of private personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the discharge. Verification from the organization(s) providing the personnel and equipment must accompany the certification. BSEE will not allow you to operate a facility for more than 2 years without an approved OSRP.

              (b) Regional OSRPs must address all the elements required for an OSRP in subpart B, or subpart D of this part, as appropriate.
              (c) When developing a Regional OSRP, you may group leases or facilities subject to the approval of the Chief, OSPD, for the purposes of:
              (1) Calculating response times;
              (2) Determining quantities of response equipment;
              (3) Conducting oil-spill trajectory analyses;
              (4) Determining worst case discharge scenarios; and
              (5) Identifying areas of special economic and environmental importance that may be impacted and the strategies for their protection.
              (d) The Chief, OSPD, may specify how to address the elements of a Regional OSRP. The Chief, OSPD, also may require that Regional OSRPs contain additional information if necessary for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.

              § 254.42
              Exercises for your response personnel and equipment.
              (a) You must exercise your entire OSRP at least once every 3 years (triennial exercise). You may satisfy this requirement by conducting separate exercises for individual parts of the OSRP over the 3-year period; you do not have to exercise your entire OSRP at one time.
              (b) In satisfying the triennial exercise requirement, you must, at a minimum, conduct:

              (1) An annual spill management team tabletop exercise. The exercise must test the spill management team's organization, communication, and decision making in managing a response. You must not reveal the spill scenario to team members before the exercise starts.
              (2) An annual deployment exercise of response equipment identified in your OSRP that is staged at onshore locations. You must deploy and operate each type of equipment in each triennial period. However, it is not necessary to deploy and operate each individual piece of equipment.
              (3) An annual notification exercise for each facility that is manned on a 24- hour basis. The exercise must test the ability of facility personnel to communicate pertinent information in a timely manner to the qualified individual.
              (4) A semiannual deployment exercise of any response equipment which the BSEE Regional Supervisor requires an owner or operator to maintain at the facility or on dedicated vessels. You must deploy and operate each type of this equipment at least once each year. Each type need not be deployed and operated at each exercise.
              (c) During your exercises, you must simulate conditions in the area of operations, including seasonal weather variations, to the extent practicable. The exercises must cover a range of scenarios over the 3-year exercise period, simulating responses to large continuous spills, spills of short duration and limited volume, and your worst case discharge scenario.
              (d) BSEE will recognize and give credit for any documented exercise conducted that satisfies some part of the required triennial exercise. You will receive this credit whether the owner or operator, an OSRO, or a Government regulatory agency initiates the exercise. BSEE will give you credit for an actual spill response if you evaluate the response and generate a proper record. Exercise documentation should include the following information:
              (1) Type of exercise;
              (2) Date and time of the exercise;
              (3) Description of the exercise;
              (4) Objectives met; and
              (5) Lessons learned.
              (e) All records of spill-response exercises must be maintained for the complete 3-year exercise cycle. Records should be maintained at the facility or at a corporate location designated in the OSRP. Records showing that OSROs and oil spill removal cooperatives have deployed each type of equipment also must be maintained for the 3-year cycle.
              (f) You must inform the Chief, OSPD of the date of any exercise required by paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (4) of this section at least 30 days before the exercise. This will allow BSEE personnel the opportunity to witness any exercises.
              (g) The Regional Supervisor periodically will initiate unannounced drills to test the spill response preparedness of owners and operators.
              (h) The Chief, OSPD may require changes in the frequency or location of the required exercises, equipment to be deployed and operated, or deployment procedures or strategies. The Chief, OSPD may evaluate the results of the exercises and advise the owner or operator of any needed changes in response equipment, procedures, or strategies.
              (i) Compliance with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines will satisfy the exercise requirements of this section. Copies of the PREP document may be obtained from the Chief, OSPD.

              Calculating response equipment effective daily recovery capacities.

              (a) You are required by § 254.26(d)(1) to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of the response equipment identified in your OSRP that you would use to contain and recover your worst case discharge. You must calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of the equipment by multiplying the manufacturer's rated throughput capacity over a 24-hour period by 20 percent. This 20 percent efficiency factor takes into account the limitations of the recovery operations due to available daylight, sea state, temperature, viscosity, and emulsification of the oil being recovered. You must use this calculated rate to determine if you have sufficient recovery capacity to respond to your worst case discharge scenario.
              (b) If you want to use a different efficiency factor for specific oil recovery devices, you must submit evidence to substantiate that efficiency factor. Adequate evidence includes verified performance data measured during actual spills or test data gathered according to the provisions of § 254.45(b) and (c).

              (a) The Regional Supervisor may require performance testing of any spill-response equipment listed in your OSRP to verify its capabilities if the equipment:
              (1) Has been modified;
              (2) Has been damaged and repaired; or
              (3) Has a claimed effective daily recovery capacity that is inconsistent with data otherwise available to BSEE.
              (b) You must conduct any required performance testing of booms in accordance with BSEE-approved test criteria. You may use the document “Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil-Spill Containment Booms,” available from BSEE, for guidance. Performance testing of skimmers also must be conducted in accordance with BSEE approved test criteria. You may use the document “Suggested Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil Spill Skimmers for the OCS,” available from BSEE, for guidance.
              (c) You are responsible for any required testing of equipment performance and for the accuracy of the information submitted.

              § 254.46
              Whom do I notify if an oil spill occurs?
              (a) You must immediately notify the National Response Center (1-800-424-8802) if you observe:
              (1) An oil spill from your facility;
              (2) An oil spill from another offshore facility; or
              (3) An offshore spill of unknown origin.
              (b) In the event of a spill of 1 barrel or more from your facility, you must orally notify the Regional Supervisor without delay. You also must report spills from your facility of unknown size but thought to be 1 barrel or more.
              (1) If a spill from your facility not originally reported to the Regional Supervisor is subsequently found to be 1 barrel or more, you must then report it without delay.
              (2) You must file a written follow up report for any spill from your facility of 1 barrel or more. The Chief, OSPD must receive this confirmation within 15 days after the spillage has been stopped. All reports must include the cause, location, volume, and remedial action taken. Reports of spills of more than 50 barrels must include information on the sea state, meteorological conditions, and the size and appearance of the slick. The Regional Supervisor may require additional information if it is determined that an analysis of the response is necessary.
              (c) If you observe a spill resulting from operations at another offshore facility, you must immediately notify the responsible party and the Regional Supervisor.

              § 254.47
              Determining the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario.
              You must calculate the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario as follows:
              (a) For an oil production platform facility, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the sum of the following:

              (1) The maximum capacity of all oil storage tanks and flow lines on the facility. Flow line volume may be estimated; and
              
              (2) The volume of oil calculated to leak from a break in any pipelines connected to the facility considering shutdown time, the effect of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces and other factors; and
              (3) The daily production volume from an uncontrolled blowout of the highest capacity well associated with the facility. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must consider reservoir characteristics, casing/production tubing sizes, and historical production and reservoir pressure data. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by § 254.26(d)(1).
              (b) For exploratory or development drilling operations, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the daily volume possible from an uncontrolled blowout. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must consider any known reservoir characteristics. If reservoir characteristics are unknown, you must consider the characteristics of any analog reservoirs from the area and give an explanation for the selection of the reservoir(s) used. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by § 254.26(d)(1).
              (c) For a pipeline facility, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the volume possible from a pipeline break. You must calculate this volume as follows:
              (1) Add the pipeline system leak detection time to the shutdown response time.
              (2) Multiply the time calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the highest measured oil flow rate over the preceding 12-month period. For new pipelines, you should use the predicted oil flow rate in the calculation.
              (3) Add to the volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the total volume of oil that would leak from the pipeline after it is shut in. Calculate this volume by taking into account the effects of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces, length of pipeline segment, tie-ins with other pipelines, and other factors.
              (d) If your facility which stores, handles, transfers, processes, or transports oil does not fall into the categories listed in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, contact the Chief, OSPD for instructions on the calculation of the volume of your worst case discharge scenario.

              Cancellation of leases.

              (a) Any nonproducing lease issued under the act may be cancelled by the authorized officer whenever the lessee fails to comply with any provision of the act or lease or applicable regulations, if such failure to comply continues for 30 days after mailing of notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner at the owner's record post office address. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial review as provided in section 23(b) of the Act.
              (b) Producing leases issued under the Act may be cancelled by the Secretary whenever the lessee fails to comply with any provision of the Act, applicable regulations or the lease only after judicial proceedings as prescribed by section 5(d) of the Act.
              (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, shall be canceled by the authorized officer upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been afforded to the lessee.
              (d) Pursuant to section 5(a) of the Act, the Secretary may cancel a lease when:
              (1) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause serious harm or damage to life, property, any mineral, National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal or human environment;
              (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
              (3) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing such lease or permit in force. Procedures and conditions contained in § 550.182 shall apply as appropriate.

              Jurisdiction and responsibilities of Director.
              Subject to the authority of the Secretary, the following activities are subject to the regulations in this part and are under the jurisdiction of the Director: Exploration, testing, and mining operations together with the associated environmental protection measures needed to permit those activities to be conducted in an environmentally responsible manner; handling, measurement, and transportation of OCS minerals; and other operations and activities conducted pursuant to a lease issued under 30 CFR part 581, or pursuant to a right of use and easement granted under 30 CFR 582.30, by or on behalf of a lessee or the holder of a right of use and easement.
            
            
              § 282.11
              Director's authority.
              (a)-(c) [Reserved]
              (d)(1) The Director may approve the consolidation of two or more OCS mineral leases or portions of two or more OCS mineral leases into a single mining unit requested by lessees, or the Director may require such consolidation when the operation of those leases or portions of leases as a single mining unit is in the interest of conservation of the natural resources of the OCS or the prevention of waste. A mining unit may also include all or portions of one or more OCS mineral leases with all or portions of one or more adjacent State leases for minerals in a common orebody. A single unit operator shall be responsible for submission of required Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans covering OCS mineral operations for an approved mining unit.
              (2) Operations such as exploration, testing, and mining activities conducted in accordance with an approved plan on any lease or portion of a lease which is subject to an approved mining unit shall be considered operations on each of the leases that is made subject to the approved mining unit.
              (3) Minimum royalty paid pursuant to a Federal lease, which is subject to an approved mining unit, is creditable against the production royalties allocated to that Federal lease during the lease year for which the minimum royalty is paid.
              (4) Any OCS minerals produced from State and Federal leases which are subject to an approved mining unit shall be accounted for separately unless a method of allocating production between State and Federal leases has been approved by the Director and the appropriate State official.
            
            
              
              § 282.12
              Director's responsibilities.
              (a) The Director is responsible for the regulation of activities to assure that all operations conducted under a lease or right of use and easement are conducted in a manner that protects the environment and promotes orderly development of OCS mineral resources. Those activities are to be designed to prevent serious harm or damage to, or waste of, any natural resource (including OCS mineral deposits and oil, gas, and sulphur resources in areas leased or not leased), any life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment.
              (b)-(d) [Reserved]
              (e) The Director shall assure that a scheduled onsite compliance inspection of each facility which is subject to regulations in this part is conducted at least once a year. The inspection shall be to determine that the lessee is in compliance with the requirements of the law; provisions of the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; and the regulations in this part. Additional unscheduled onsite inspections shall be conducted without advance notice to the lessee to assure compliance with the provisions of applicable law; the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; and the regulations in this part.
              (f)(1) The Director shall, after completion of the technical and environmental evaluations, approve, disapprove, or require modification of the lessee's requests, applications, plans, and notices submitted pursuant to the provisions of this part; issue orders to govern lease operations; and require compliance with applicable provisions of the law, the regulations, the lease, and the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plans. The Director may give oral orders or approvals whenever prior approval is required before the commencement of an operation or activity. Oral orders or approvals given in response to a written request shall be confirmed in writing within 3 working days after issuance of the order or granting of the oral approval.
              (2) The Director shall, after completion of the technical and environmental evaluations, approve, disapprove, or require modification, as appropriate, of the design plan, fabrication plan, and installation plan for platforms, artificial islands, and other installations and devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed. The approval, disapproval, or requirement to modify such plans may take the form of a condition of granting a right of use and easement under paragraph (a) of this section or as authorized under any lease issued or maintained under the Act.
              (g) [Reserved]
              (h) The Director may prescribe or approve, in writing or orally, departures from the operating requirements of the regulations of this part when such departures are necessary to facilitate the proper development of a lease; to conserve natural resources; or to protect life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment.
            
            
              § 282.13
              Suspension of production or other operations.
              (a) The Director may direct the suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other operation or activity on all or any part of a lease when it has been determined that such suspension or temporary prohibition is in the National interest to:
              (1) Facilitate proper development of a lease including a reasonable time to develop a mine and construct necessary support facilities, or
              (2) Allow for the construction or negotiation for use of transportation facilities.
              (b) The Director may also direct or, at the request of the lessee, approve a suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other operation or activity, if:
              (1) The lessee failed to comply with a provision of applicable law, regulation, order, or the lease;
              (2) There is a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposit, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
              (3) The suspension or temporary prohibition is in the interest of National security or defense;

              (4) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary for the initiation and conduct of an environmental evaluation to define mitigation measures to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.
              (5) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to facilitate the installation of equipment necessary for safety of operations and protection of the environment;
              (6) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to allow for undue delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals;
              (7) The Director determines that continued operations would result in premature abandonment of a producing mine, resulting in the loss of otherwise recoverable OCS minerals;
              (8) The Director determines that the lessee cannot successfully operate a producing mine due to market conditions that are either temporary in nature or require temporary shutdown and reinvestment in order for the lessee to adapt to the conditions; or
              (9) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or activity, or the permitting of those activities, effective the date set by the court for that prohibition.
              (c) When the Director orders or approves a suspension or a temporary prohibition of operation or activity including production on all of a lease pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the term of the lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time that the suspension or temporary prohibition is in effect, except that no lease shall be so extended when the suspension or temporary prohibition is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or willful violation of a provision of the lease or governing regulations.
              (d) The Director may, at any time within the period prescribed for a suspension or temporary prohibition issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, require the lessee to submit a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for approval in accordance with the requirements for the approval of such plans in part 582 of this title.
              (e)(1) When the Director orders or issues a suspension or a temporary prohibition pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Director may require the lessee to conduct site-specific studies to identify and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the suspension or temporary prohibition, the potential for damage from the hazard(s), and the measures available for mitigating the hazard(s). The nature, scope, and content of any study shall be subject to approval by the Director. The lessee shall furnish copies and all results of any such study to the Director. The cost of the study shall be borne by the lessee unless the Director arranges for the cost of the study to be borne by a party other than the lessee. The Director shall make results of any such study available to interested parties and to the public as soon as practicable after the completion of the study and submission of the results thereof.
              (2) When the Director determines that measures are necessary, on the basis of the results of the studies conducted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section and other information available to and identified by the Director, the lessee will be required to take appropriate measures to mitigate, avoid, or minimize the damage or potential damage on which the suspension or temporary prohibition is based. In choosing between alternative mitigation measures, the Director will balance the cost of the required measures against the reduction or potential reduction in damage or threat of damage or harm to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), to the National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment. When deemed appropriate by the Director, the lessee must submit to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management a revised Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan that incorporates the mitigation measures required by the Director.

              (f)(1) If under the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, the Director, with respect to any lease, directs the suspension of production or other operations on the entire leasehold, no payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be due for or during the period of the directed suspension and the time for the lessee specify royalty free period of a period of reduced royalty pursuant to 30 CFR 581.28(b) will be extended for the period of directed suspension. If under the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section the Director, with respect to a lease on which there has been no production, directs the suspension of operations on the entire leasehold, no payment of rental shall be due during the period of the directed suspension.
              (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director grants the request of a lessee for a suspension of production or other operations, the lessee's obligations to pay rental, minimum royalty, or royalty shall continue to apply during the period of the approved suspension, unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspension authorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approved suspension. If under the provision of this section, the Director grants a lessee's request for a suspension of production or other operations for a lease which includes provisions for a time period which the lessee may specify during which production from the leasehold would be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation pursuant to 30 CFR 581.28(b), the time during which production from a leasehold may be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation shall not be extended unless the Director's approval of the suspension specifies otherwise.
              (3) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief resulting therefrom.

            Subpart A—Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement Appeal Procedures
            
              § 290.1
              What is the purpose of this subpart?
              The purpose of this subpart is to explain the procedures for appeals of Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) decisions and orders issued under 30 CFR chapter II.
            
            
              § 290.2
              Who may appeal?
              If you are adversely affected by a BSEE official's final decision or order issued under 30 CFR chapter II, you may appeal that decision or order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA). Your appeal must conform with the procedures found in this subpart and 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.
            
            
              § 290.3
              What is the time limit for filing an appeal?
              You must file your appeal within 60 days after you receive BSEE's final decision or order. The 60-day time period applies rather than the time period provided in 43 CFR 4.411(a). A decision or order is received on the date you sign a receipt confirming delivery or, if there is no receipt, the date otherwise documented.
            
            
              § 290.4
              How do I file an appeal?
              For your appeal to be filed, BSEE must receive all of the following within 60 days after you receive the decision or order:
              (a) A written Notice of Appeal together with a copy of the decision or order you are appealing in the office of the BSEE officer that issued the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and
              (b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of Appeal.

              (1) You must pay electronically through the Fees for Services page on the BSEE Web site at http://www.bsee.gov, and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page with your Notice of Appeal.
              (2) You cannot extend the 60-day period for payment of the processing fee.

              § 290.5

              You cannot obtain an extension of time to file the Notice of Appeal. See 43 CFR 4.411(c).
            
            
              § 290.6
              Are informal resolutions permitted?
              (a) You may seek informal resolution with the issuing officer's next level supervisor during the 60-day period established in § 290.3.
              (b) Nothing in this subpart precludes resolution by settlement of any appeal or matter pending in the administrative process after the 60-day period established in § 290.3.
            
            
              § 290.7
              Do I have to comply with the decision or order while my appeal is pending?
              (a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for filing an appeal under § 290.3 unless:

              (1) BSEE notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any mineral deposit, or property; or
              (2) You post a surety bond under 30 CFR 250.1409 pending the appeal challenging an order to pay a civil penalty.
              (b) This section applies rather than 43 CFR 4.21(a) for appeals of BSEE orders.
              (c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or order under appeal.
            
            
              § 290.8
              How do I exhaust my administrative remedies?
              (a) If you receive a decision or order issued under chapter II, subchapter B, you must appeal that decision or order to IBLA under 43 CFR part 4, subpart E to exhaust administrative remedies.
              (b) This section does not apply if the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management or the IBLA makes a decision or order immediately effective notwithstanding an appeal.

            § 291.109
            Can I ask for a fee waiver or a reduced processing fee?
            (a) BSEE may grant a fee waiver or fee reduction in extraordinary circumstances. You may request a waiver or reduction of your fee by:
            (1) Sending a written request to the BSEE Office of Policy and Analysis when you file your complaint; and
            (2) Demonstrating in your request that you are unable to pay the fee or that payment of the full fee would impose an undue hardship upon you.
            (b) The BSEE Office of Policy and Analysis will send you a written decision granting or denying your request for a fee waiver or a fee reduction.
            (1) If we grant your request for a fee reduction, you must pay the reduced processing fee within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.
            (2) If we deny your request, you must pay the entire processing fee within 30 days of the date you receive the decision.

            § 291.110
            Who may BSEE require to produce information?
            (a) BSEE may require any lessee, operator of a lease or unit, shipper, grantee, or transporter to provide information that BSEE believes is necessary to make a decision on whether open access or nondiscriminatory access was denied.
            (b) If you are a party and fail to provide information BSEE requires under paragraph (a) of this section, BSEE may:
            (1) Assess civil penalties under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N;
            (2) Dismiss your complaint or consider your answer incomplete; or
            (3) Presume the required information is adverse to you on the factual issues to which the information is relevant.
            (c) If you are not a party to a complaint and fail to provide information BSEE requires under paragraph (a) of this section, BSEE may assess civil penalties under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N.
          
          
            § 291.111
            How does BSEE treat the confidential information I provide?
            (a) Any person who provides documents under this part in response to a request by BSEE to inform a decision on whether open access or nondiscriminatory access was denied may claim that some or all of the information contained in a particular document is confidential. If you claim confidential treatment, then when you provide the document to BSEE you must:
            (1) Provide a complete unredacted copy of the document and indicate on that copy that you are making a request for confidential treatment for some or all of the information in the document.
            (2) Provide a statement specifying the specific statutory justification for nondisclosure of the information for which you claim confidential treatment. General claims of confidentiality are not sufficient. You must furnish sufficient information for BSEE to make an informed decision on the request for confidential treatment.
            (3) Provide a second copy of the document from which you have redacted the information for which you wish to claim confidential treatment. If you do not submit a second copy of the document with the confidential information redacted, BSEE may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.
            (b) In making data and information you submit available to the public, BSEE will not disclose documents exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and will follow the procedures set forth in the implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2 to give submitters an opportunity to object to disclosure.
            (c) BSEE retains the right to make the determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. BSEE will notify you of its decision to deny a claim, in whole or in part, and, to the extent permitted by law, will give you an opportunity to respond at least 10 days before its public disclosure.
          
          
            § 291.112
            What process will BSEE follow in rendering a decision on whether a grantee or transporter has provided open and nondiscriminatory access?
            BSEE will begin processing a complaint upon receipt of a processing fee or granting a waiver of the fee. The BSEE Director will review the complaint, answer, and other information, and will serve all parties with a written decision that:
            (a) Makes findings of fact and conclusions of law; and
            (b) Renders a decision determining whether the complainant has been denied open and nondiscriminatory access.
          
          
            § 291.113
            What actions may BSEE take to remedy denial of open and nondiscriminatory access?

            If the BSEE Director's decision under § 291.112 determines that the grantee or transporter has not provided open access or nondiscriminatory access, then the decision will describe the actions BSEE will take to require the grantee or transporter to remedy the denial of open access or nondiscriminatory access. The remedies BSEE would require must be consistent with BSEE's statutory authority, regulations, and any limits thereon due to Congressional delegations to other agencies. Actions BSEE may take include, but are not limited to:
            
            (a) Ordering grantees and transporters to provide open and nondiscriminatory access to the complainant;
            (b) Assessing civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N, for failure to comply with a BSEE order to provide open access or nondiscriminatory access. Penalties will begin to accrue 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access if it has not provided such access by that time. However, if BSEE determines that requiring the construction of facilities would be an appropriate remedy under the OCSLA, penalties will begin to accrue 10 days after conclusion of diligent construction of needed facilities or 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access, whichever is later, if it has not provided such access by that time;
            (c) Requesting the Attorney General to institute a civil action in the appropriate United States District Court under 43 U.S.C. 1350(a) for a temporary restraining order, injunction, or other appropriate remedy to enforce the open and nondiscriminatory access requirements of 43 U.S.C. 1334(e) and (f)(1)(A); or
            (d) Initiating a proceeding to forfeit the right-of-way grant under 43 U.S.C. 1334(e).
          
          
            § 291.114
            How do I appeal to the IBLA?
            Any party, except as provided in § 291.115(b), adversely affected by a decision of the BSEE Director under this part may appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) under the procedures in 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.
          
          
            § 291.115
            How do I exhaust administrative remedies?
            (a) If the BSEE Director issues a decision under this part but does not expressly make the decision effective upon issuance, you must appeal the decision to the IBLA under 43 CFR part 4 to exhaust administrative remedies. Such decision will not be effective during the time in which a person adversely affected by the BSEE Director's decision may file a notice of appeal with the IBLA, and the timely filing of a notice of appeal will suspend the effect of the decision pending the decision on appeal.
            (b) This section does not apply if a decision was made effective by:
            (1) The BSEE Director; or
            (2) The Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.

                (a) Any alternate procedures or equipment that you propose to use must provide a level of safety and environmental protection that equals or surpasses current BOEM requirements.
                (b) You must receive the Regional Supervisor's written approval before you can use alternate procedures or equipment.
                (c) To receive approval, you must either submit information or give an oral presentation to the appropriate Regional Supervisor.

                § 550.143
                How do I designate an operator?
                (a) You must provide the Regional Supervisor an executed Designation of Operator form (Form BOEM-1123) unless you are the only lessee and are the only person conducting lease operations. When there is more than one lessee, each lessee must submit the Designation of Operator form and the Regional Supervisor must approve the designation before the designated operator may begin operations on the leasehold.
                (b) This designation is authority for the designated operator to act on your behalf and to fulfill your obligations under the Act, the lease, and the regulations in this part.
                (c) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide the Regional Supervisor a written notification of any change of address.

                (d) If you change the designated operator on your lease, you must pay the service fee listed in § 550.125 of this subpart with your request for a change in designation of operator. Should there be multiple lessees, all designation of operator forms must be collected by one lessee and submitted to BOEM in a single submittal, which is subject to only one filing fee.
              
              
                § 550.144

                (a) When a Designation of Operator terminates, the Regional Supervisor must approve a new designated operator before you may continue operations. Each lessee must submit a new executed Designation of Operator form.
                (b) If your Designation of Operator is terminated, or a controversy develops between you and your designated operator, you and your designated operator must protect the lessor's interests.
              
              
                § 550.146
                How do I designate an agent or a local agent?
                (a) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional Supervisor's approval, or the Regional Director may require you to designate an agent empowered to fulfill your obligations under the Act, the lease, or the regulations in this part.
                (b) You or your designated operator may designate for the Regional Supervisor's approval a local agent empowered to receive notices and submit requests, applications, notices, or supplemental information.

                (b) If your designated operator fails to fulfill any of your obligations under 30 CFR parts 250 through 282 and 30 CFR parts 550 through 582, the Regional Supervisor may require you or any or all of your co-lessees to fulfill those obligations or other operational obligations under the Act, the lease, or the regulations.
                (c) Whenever the regulations in 30 CFR parts 250 through 282 and 30 CFR parts 550 through 582 require the lessee to meet a requirement or perform an action, the lessee, operator (if one has been designated), and the person actually performing the activity to which the requirement applies are jointly and severally responsible for complying with the regulation.

                § 550.181
                When may the Secretary cancel my lease and when am I compensated for cancellation?
                If the Secretary cancels your lease under this part or under 30 CFR part 556, you are entitled to compensation under § 550.184. Section 550.185 states conditions under which you will receive no compensation. The Secretary may cancel a lease after notice and opportunity for a hearing when:
                (a) Continued activity on the lease would probably cause harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
                (b) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time;
                (c) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing the lease in force; and
                (d) A suspension has been in effect for at least 5 years or you request termination of the suspension and lease cancellation.
              
              
                § 550.182
                When may the Secretary cancel a lease at the exploration stage?
                BOEM may not approve an exploration plan (EP) under 30 CFR part 550, subpart B, if the Regional Supervisor determines that the proposed activities may cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits, the National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment, and that the proposed activity cannot be modified to avoid the condition(s). The Secretary may cancel the lease if:
                (a) The primary lease term has not expired (or if the lease term has been extended) and exploration has been prohibited for 5 years following the disapproval; or
                (b) You request cancellation at an earlier time.
              
              
                § 550.183
                When may BOEM or the Secretary extend or cancel a lease at the development and production stage?
                (a) BOEM may extend your lease if you submit a DPP and the Regional Supervisor disapproves the plan according to the regulations in 30 CFR part 550, subpart B. Following the disapproval:

                (1) BOEM will allow you to hold the lease for 5 years, or less time at your request;
                
                (2) Any time within 5 years after the disapproval, you may reapply for approval of the same or a modified plan; and
                (3) The Regional Supervisor will approve, disapprove, or require modification of the plan under 30 CFR part 550, subpart B.
                (b) If the Regional Supervisor has not approved a DPP or required you to submit a DPP for approval or modification, the Secretary will cancel the lease:
                (1) When the 5-year period in paragraph (a)(1) of this section expires; or
                (2) If you request cancellation at an earlier time.
              
              
                § 550.184
                What is the amount of compensation for lease cancellation?
                When the Secretary cancels a lease under §§ 550.181, 550.182 or 550.183 of this subpart, you are entitled to receive compensation under 43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2)(C). You must show the Director that the amount of compensation claimed is the lesser of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section:
                (a) The fair value of the cancelled rights as of the date of cancellation, taking into account both:
                (1) Anticipated revenues from the lease; and
                (2) Costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, including:
                (i) Costs of compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders; and
                (ii) Liability for cleanup costs or damages, or both, in the case of an oil spill.
                (b) The excess, if any, over your revenues from the lease (plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of reimbursement) of:
                (1) All consideration paid for the lease (plus interest from the date of payment to the date of reimbursement); and
                (2) All your direct expenditures (plus interest from the date of payment to the date of reimbursement):
                (i) After the issue date of the lease; and
                (ii) For exploration or development, or both.
                (c) Compensation for leases issued before September 18, 1978, will be equal to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              
              
                § 550.185
                When is there no compensation for a lease cancellation?
                You will not receive compensation from BOEM for lease cancellation if:
                (a) BOEM disapproves a DPP because you do not receive concurrence by the State under section 307(c)(3)(B)(i) or (ii) of the CZMA, and the Secretary of Commerce does not make the finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA;
                (b) You do not submit a DPP under 30 CFR part 550, subpart B or do not comply with the approved DPP;
                (c) As the lessee of a nonproducing lease, you fail to comply with the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the Act, and the default continues for 30 days after BOEM mails you a notice by overnight mail;
                (d) The Regional Supervisor disapproves a DPP because you fail to comply with the requirements of applicable Federal law; or
                (e) The Secretary forfeits and cancels a producing lease under section 5(d) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1334(d)).

                (1) You may obtain copies of forms from, and submit completed forms to, the Regional Supervisor.
                (2) Instead of paper copies of forms available from the Regional Supervisor, you may use your own computer-generated forms that are equal in size to BOEM's forms. You must arrange the data on your form identical to the BOEM form. If you generate your own form and it omits terms and conditions contained on the official BOEM form, we will consider it to contain the omitted terms and conditions.
                (3) You may submit digital data when the Region is equipped to accept it.
                (b) When BOEM specifies, you must include, for public information, an additional copy of such reports.
                (1) You must mark it Public Information.

                § 550.194
                How must I protect archaeological resources?
                (a) If the Regional Director has reason to believe that an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, the Regional Director will require in writing that your EP, DOCD, or DPP be accompanied by an archaeological report. If the archaeological report suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, you must either:
                (1) Locate the site of any operation so as not to adversely affect the area where the archaeological resource may be; or
                (2) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected by operations. This requires further archaeological investigation, conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment and techniques the Regional Director considers appropriate. You must submit the investigation report to the Regional Director for review.
                (b) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological resource is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely affected by operations, the Regional Director will notify you immediately. You must not take any action that may adversely affect the archaeological resource until the Regional Director has told you how to protect the resource.
                (c) If you discover any archaeological resource while conducting operations in the lease or right-of-way area, you must immediately halt operations within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the BOEM Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is significant, the Regional Director will tell you how to protect it.

                (a) BOEM will reimburse you for costs of reproducing data and information that the Regional Director requests if:
                (1) You deliver geophysical and geological (G&G) data and information to BOEM for the Regional Director to inspect or select and retain;
                (2) BOEM receives your request for reimbursement and the Regional Director determines that the requested reimbursement is proper; and
                (3) The cost is at your lowest rate or at the lowest commercial rate established in the area, whichever is less.
                (b) BOEM will reimburse you for the costs of processing geophysical information (that does not include cost of data acquisition):
                (1) If, at the request of the Regional Director, you processed the geophysical data or information in a form or manner other than that used in the normal conduct of business; or
                (2) If you collected the information under a permit that BOEM issued to you before October 1, 1985, and the Regional Director requests and retains the information.
                (c) When you request reimbursement, you must identify reproduction and processing costs separately from acquisition costs.
                (d) BOEM will not reimburse you for data acquisition costs or for the costs of analyzing or processing geological information or interpreting geological or geophysical information.

                How will BOEM evaluate the environmental impacts of the DPP or DOCD?

                The Regional Supervisor will evaluate the environmental impacts of the activities described in your proposed DPP or DOCD and prepare environmental documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C.4321 et seq.) and the implementing regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508).
                (a) Environmental impact statement (EIS) declaration. At least once in each OCS planning area (other than the Western and Central GOM Planning Areas), the Director will declare that the approval of a proposed DPP is a major Federal action, and BOEM will prepare an EIS.
                (b) Leases or units in the vicinity. Before or immediately after the Director determines that preparation of an EIS is required, the Regional Supervisor may require lessees and operators of leases or units in the vicinity of the proposed development and production activities for which DPPs have not been approved to submit information about preliminary plans for their leases or units.
                (c) Draft EIS. The Regional Supervisor will send copies of the draft EIS to the Governor of each affected State and to the executive of each affected local government who requests a copy. Additionally, when BOEM prepares a DPP EIS, and the Federally-approved CZMA program for an affected State requires a DPP NEPA document for use in determining consistency, the Regional Supervisor will forward a copy of the draft EIS to the State's CZMA agency. The Regional Supervisor will also make copies of the draft EIS available to any appropriate Federal agency, interstate regional entity, and the public.
              
              
                § 550.270
                What decisions will BOEM make on the DPP or DOCD and within what timeframe?
                (a) Timeframe. The Regional Supervisor will act on your deemed-submitted DPP or DOCD as follows:
                (1) The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 60 calendar days after the latest of the day that:

                (ii) The Secretary of Commerce has made a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security.
                (b) BOEM decision. By the deadline in paragraph (a) of this section, the Regional Supervisor will take one of the following actions:
                
                
                  
                    The regional supervisor will . . .
                    If . . .
                    And then . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Approve your DPP or DOCD,
                    It complies with all applicable requirements,
                    The Regional Supervisor will notify you in writing of the decision and may require you to meet certain conditions, including those to provide monitoring information.
                  
                  
                    (2) Require you to modify your proposed DPP or DOCD,
                    It fails to make adequate provisions for safety, environmental protection, or conservation of natural resources or otherwise does not comply with the lease, the Act, the regulations prescribed under the Act, or other Federal laws,
                    The Regional Supervisor will notify you in writing of the decision and describe the modifications you must make to your proposed DPP or DOCD to ensure it complies with all applicable requirements.
                  
                  
                    (3) Disapprove your DPP or DOCD,

                § 550.271
                For what reasons will BOEM disapprove the DPP or DOCD?
                The Regional Supervisor will disapprove your proposed DPP or DOCD if one of the four reasons in this section applies:
                (a) Non-compliance. The Regional Supervisor determines that you have failed to demonstrate that you can comply with the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (Act), implementing regulations, or other applicable Federal laws.
                (b) No consistency concurrence. (1) An affected State has not yet issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification (see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or
                (2) An affected State objects to your coastal zone consistency certification, and the Secretary of Commerce, under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), has not found that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security.
                (3) If the Regional Supervisor disapproved your DPP or DOCD for the sole reason that an affected State either has not yet issued a final decision on, or has objected to, your coastal zone consistency certification (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) in this section), the Regional Supervisor will approve your DPP or DOCD upon receipt of concurrence by the affected State, at the time concurrence of the affected State is conclusively presumed, or when the Secretary of Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security. In that event, you do not need to resubmit your DPP or DOCD for approval under § 550.273(b).
                (c) National security or defense conflicts. Your proposed activities would threaten National security or defense.
                (d) Exceptional circumstances. The Regional Supervisor determines because of exceptional geological conditions, exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional circumstances that all of the following apply:
                (1) Implementing your DPP or DOCD would cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the National security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
                (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
                (3) The advantages of disapproving your DPP or DOCD outweigh the advantages of development and production.
              
              
                § 550.272
                If a State objects to the DPP's or DOCD's coastal zone consistency certification, what can I do?

                If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency certification accompanying your proposed or disapproved DPP or DOCD, you may do one of the following:
                (a) Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD. Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD to accommodate the State's objection and submit the amendment or resubmittal to the Regional Supervisor for approval. The amendment or resubmittal needs to only address information related to the State's objections.
                (b) Appeal. Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part 930, subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce will either:
                (1) Grant your appeal by finding under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C.1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in detail in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security; or
                (2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (c) Withdraw your DPP or DOCD. Withdraw your DPP or DOCD if you decide not to conduct your proposed development and production activities.
              
              
                § 550.273
                How do I submit a modified DPP or DOCD or resubmit a disapproved DPP or DOCD?
                (a) Modified DPP or DOCD. If the Regional Supervisor requires you to modify your proposed DPP or DOCD under § 550.270(b)(2), you must submit the modification(s) to the Regional Supervisor in the same manner as for a new DPP or DOCD. You need submit only information related to the proposed modification(s).
                (b) Resubmitted DPP or DOCD. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves your DPP or DOCD under § 550.270(b)(3), and except as provided in § 550.271(b)(3), you may resubmit the disapproved DPP or DOCD if there is a change in the conditions that were the basis of its disapproval.
                (c) BOEM review and timeframe. The Regional Supervisor will use the performance standards in § 550.202 to either approve, require you to further modify, or disapprove your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 60 calendar days after the Regional Supervisor deems your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD to be submitted, or receives the last amendment to your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD, whichever occurs later.
              
            
            
              Post-Approval Requirements for the EP, DPP, and DOCD

                (a) Compliance. You must conduct all of your lease and unit activities according to your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD and any approval conditions. If you fail to comply with your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD:
                (1) You may be subject to BOEM enforcement action, including civil penalties; and
                (2) The lease(s) involved in your EP, DPP, or DOCD may be forfeited or cancelled under 43 U.S.C. 1334(c) or (d). If this happens, you will not be entitled to compensation under § 550.185(b) and 30 CFR 556.77.
                (b) Emergencies. Nothing in this subpart or in your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD relieves you of, or limits your responsibility to take appropriate measures to meet emergency situations. In an emergency situation, the Regional Supervisor may approve or require departures from your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD.
              
              
                § 550.281
                What must I do to conduct activities under the approved EP, DPP, or DOCD?
                (a) Approvals and permits. Before you conduct activities under your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD you must obtain the following approvals and or permits, as applicable, from the District Manager or BSEE Regional Supervisor:

                (3) If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency certification accompanying your approved EP after BOEM has approved your EP, you may either:
                (i) Revise your EP to accommodate the State's objection and submit the revision to the Regional Supervisor for approval; or
                (ii) Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part 930, subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce will either:
                (A) Grant your appeal by making the finding described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or
                (B) Deny your appeal, in which case you may revise your EP as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.
              
              
                § 550.282
                Do I have to conduct post-approval monitoring?
                After approving your EP, DPP, or DOCD, the Regional Supervisor may direct you to conduct monitoring programs, including monitoring in accordance with the ESA and the MMPA. You must retain copies of all monitoring data obtained or derived from your monitoring programs and make them available to the BOEM upon request. The Regional Supervisor may require you to:
                (a) Monitoring plans. Submit monitoring plans for approval before you begin the work; and
                (b) Monitoring reports. Prepare and submit reports that summarize and analyze data and information obtained or derived from your monitoring programs. The Regional Supervisor will specify requirements for preparing and submitting these reports.
              
              
                § 550.283
                When must I revise or supplement the approved EP, DPP, or DOCD?
                (a) Revised OCS plans. You must revise your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD when you propose to:
                (1) Change the type of drilling rig (e.g., jack-up, platform rig, barge, submersible, semisubmersible, or drillship), production facility (e.g., caisson, fixed platform with piles, tension leg platform), or transportation mode (e.g., pipeline, barge);
                (2) Change the surface location of a well or production platform by a distance more than that specified by the Regional Supervisor;
                (3) Change the type of production or significantly increase the volume of production or storage capacity;
                (4) Increase the emissions of an air pollutant to an amount that exceeds the amount specified in your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD;
                (5) Significantly increase the amount of solid or liquid wastes to be handled or discharged;
                (6) Request a new H2S area classification, or increase the concentration of H2S to a concentration greater than that specified by the Regional Supervisor;

                (7) Change the location of your onshore support base either from one State to another or to a new base or a base requiring expansion; or
                (8) Change any other activity specified by the Regional Supervisor.
                (b) Supplemental OCS plans. You must supplement your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD when you propose to conduct activities on your lease(s) or unit that require approval of a license or permit which is not described in your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD. These types of changes are called supplemental OCS plans.
              
              
                § 550.284
                How will BOEM require revisions to the approved EP, DPP, or DOCD?
                (a) Periodic review. The Regional Supervisor will periodically review the activities you conduct under your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD and may require you to submit updated information on your activities. The frequency and extent of this review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities in your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD.
                (b) Results of review. The Regional Supervisor may require you to revise your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD based on this review. In such cases, the Regional Supervisor will inform you of the reasons for the decision.
              
              
                § 550.285
                How do I submit revised and supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs?
                (a) Submittal. You must submit to the Regional Supervisor any revisions and supplements to approved EPs, DPPs, or DOCDs for approval, whether you initiate them or the Regional Supervisor orders them.
                (b) Information. Revised and supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs need include only information related to or affected by the proposed changes, including information on changes in expected environmental impacts.
                (c) Procedures. All supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs, and those revised EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs that the Regional Supervisor determines are likely to result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated, are subject to all of the procedures under §§ 550.231 through 550.235 for EPs and §§ 550.266 through 550.273 for DPPs and DOCDs.

                When and how must I submit a CID or a revision to a CID?
                (a) You must submit one original and two copies of a CID to the appropriate OCS Region at the same time you first submit your DOCD or DPP for any development of a lease or leases located in water depths greater than 400 meters (1,312 feet). You must also submit a CID for a Supplemental DOCD or DPP when requested by the Regional Supervisor. The submission of your CID must be accompanied by payment of the service fee listed in § 550.125.
                (b) If you decide not to develop a reservoir you committed to develop in your CID, you must submit one original and two copies of a revision to the CID to the appropriate OCS Region. The revision to the CID must be submitted within 14 calendar days after making your decision not to develop the reservoir and before the reservoir is bypassed. The Regional Supervisor will approve or disapprove any such revision to the original CID. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves the revision, you must develop the reservoir as described in the original CID.

              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 550.302
              Definitions concerning air quality.

              For purposes of §§ 550.303 and 550.304 of this part:
              
              
                Air pollutant means any combination of agents for which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established, pursuant to section 109 of the Clean Air Act, national primary or secondary ambient air quality standards.
              
                Attainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is shown by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling (or other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) not to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standards established by EPA.
              
                Best available control technology (BACT) means an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air pollutant subject to regulation, taking into account energy, environmental and economic impacts, and other costs. The BACT shall be verified on a case-by-case basis by the Regional Supervisor and may include reductions achieved through the application of processes, systems, and techniques for the control of each air pollutant.
              
                Emission offsets mean emission reductions obtained from facilities, either onshore or offshore, other than the facility or facilities covered by the proposed Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan.
              
                Existing facility is an OCS facility described in an Exploration Plan or a Development and Production Plan submitted or approved prior to June 2, 1980.
              
                Facility means any installation or device permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed which is used for exploration, development, and production activities for oil, gas, or sulphur and which emits or has the potential to emit any air pollutant from one or more sources. All equipment directly associated with the installation or device shall be considered part of a single facility if the equipment is dependent on, or affects the processes of, the installation or device. During production, multiple installations or devices will be considered to be a single facility if the installations or devices are directly related to the production of oil, gas, or sulphur at a single site. Any vessel used to transfer production from an offshore facility shall be considered part of the facility while physically attached to it.
              
                Nonattainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is shown by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling (or other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standard established by EPA.
              
                Projected emissions mean emissions, either controlled or uncontrolled, from a source(s).
              
                Source means an emission point. Several sources may be included within a single facility.
              
                Temporary facility means activities associated with the construction of platforms offshore or with facilities related to exploration for or development of offshore oil and gas resources which are conducted in one location for less than 3 years.
              
                Volatile organic compound (VOC) means any organic compound which is emitted to the atmosphere as a vapor. The unreactive compounds are exempt from the above definition.
            
            
              § 550.303
              Facilities described in a new or revised Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan.
              (a) New plans. All Exploration Plans and Development and Production Plans shall include the information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section, and the lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
              (b) Applicability of § 550.303 to existing facilities. (1) The Regional Supervisor may review any Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan to determine whether any facility described in the plan should be subject to review under this section and has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area. To make these decisions, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the distance of the facility from shore, the size of the facility, the number of sources planned for the facility and their operational status, and the air quality status of the onshore area.

              (2) For a facility identified by the Regional Supervisor in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to the information required in § 550.218 or § 550.249 of this part and to submit only that information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
              (c) Revised facilities. All revised Exploration Plans and Development and Production Plans shall include the information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
              (d) Exemption formulas. To determine whether a facility described in a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee shall use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility for each air pollutant calculated in § 550.249(a) or § 550.218(a) of this part and compare these emissions to the emission exemption amount “E” for each air pollutant calculated using the following formulas: E = 3400D 2/3 for carbon monoxide (CO); and E = 33.3D for total suspended particulates (TSP), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and VOC (where E is the emission exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of the proposed facility from the closest onshore area of a State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of these projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption amount “E” for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt from further air quality review required under paragraphs (e) through (i) of this section.
              (e) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph (d) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall use an approved air quality model to determine whether the projected emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

              (f) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the significance level determined under paragraph (e) of this section for that air pollutant, shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for that air pollutant.
              (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not exempt under paragraph (d) of this section for that air pollutant shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for VOC.
              (g) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from any facility, except a temporary facility, which significantly affect the quality of a nonattainment area, shall be fully reduced. This shall be done through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.
              (2) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which significantly affect the air quality of an attainment or unclassifiable area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.

              (i)(A) Except for temporary facilities, the lessee also shall use an approved air quality model to determine whether the emissions of TSP or SO2 that remain after the application of BACT cause the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentrations established in 40 CFR 52.21 to be exceeded in the attainment or unclassifiable area:

              (B) No concentration of an air pollutant shall exceed the concentration permitted under the national secondary ambient air quality standard or the concentration permitted under the national primary air quality standard, whichever concentration is lowest for the air pollutant for the period of exposure. For any period other than the annual period, the applicable maximum allowable increase may be exceeded during one such period per year at any one onshore location.

              (ii) If the maximum allowable increases are exceeded, the lessee shall apply whatever additional emission controls are necessary to reduce or offset the remaining emissions of TSP or SO2 so that concentrations in the onshore ambient air of an attainment or unclassifiable area do not exceed the maximum allowable increases.
              (3)(i) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility, except a temporary facility, which significantly affect the onshore air quality of a nonattainment area shall be fully reduced. This shall be done through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.
              (ii) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which significantly affect the onshore air quality of an attainment area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
              (4)(i) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the onshore air quality of both a nonattainment and an attainment or unclassifiable area, the regulatory requirements applicable to projected emissions significantly affecting a nonattainment area shall apply.
              (ii) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the onshore air quality of more than one class of attainment area, the lessee must reduce projected emissions to meet the maximum allowable increases specified for each class in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
              (h) Controls required on temporary facilities. The lessee shall apply BACT to reduce projected emissions of any air pollutant from a temporary facility which significantly affects the air quality of an onshore area of a State.
              (i) Emission offsets. When emission offsets are to be obtained, the lessee must demonstrate that the offsets are equivalent in nature and quantity to the projected emissions that must be reduced after the application of BACT; a binding commitment exists between the lessee and the owner or owners of the source or sources; the appropriate air quality control jurisdiction has been notified of the need to revise the State Implementation Plan to include the information regarding the offsets; and the required offsets come from sources which affect the air quality of the area significantly affected by the lessee's offshore operations.
              (j) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. If, during the review of a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether emission control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of an onshore area of the State.
              (k) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from the facility. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
              (l) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit meteorological data from a facility.
            
            
              § 550.304
              Existing facilities.
              (a) Process leading to review of an existing facility. (1) An affected State may request that the Regional Supervisor supply basic emission data from existing facilities when such data are needed for the updating of the State's emission inventory. In submitting the request, the State must demonstrate that similar offshore and onshore facilities in areas under the State's jurisdiction are also included in the emission inventory.
              (2) The Regional Supervisor may require lessees of existing facilities to submit basic emission data to a State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (3) The State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may submit information from its emission inventory which indicates that emissions from existing facilities may be significantly affecting the air quality of the onshore area of the State. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of the State.
              (4) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the information submitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall determine, based on the basic emission data, available meteorological data, and the distance of the facility or facilities from the onshore area, whether any existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of the State.
              (5) If the Regional Supervisor determines that no existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the State of and explain the reasons for this finding.
              (6) If the Regional Supervisor determines that an existing facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to the information requirements under § 550.218 or § 550.249 of this part and submit only that information required to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
              (b) Exemption formulas. To determine whether an existing facility is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee shall use the highest annual total amount of emissions from the facility for each air pollutant calculated in § 550.218(a) or § 550.249(a) of this part and compare these emissions to the emission exemption amount “E” for each air pollutant calculated using the following formulas: E = 3400D2/3 for CO; and E = 33.3D for TSP, SO2, NOX, and VOC (where E is the emission exemption amount expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of the facility from the closest onshore area of the State expressed in statute miles). If the amount of projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission exemption amount “E” for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt for that air pollutant from further air quality review required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
              (c) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall use an approved air quality model to determine whether projected emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

              (d) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an onshore ambient air concentration above the significance levels determined under paragraph (c) of this section for that air pollutant shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for that air pollutant.
              (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section for that air pollutant shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area for VOC.
              (e) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air pollutant which significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
              (2) The lessee shall submit a compliance schedule for the application of BACT. If it is necessary to cease operations to allow for the installation of emission controls, the lessee may apply for a suspension of operations under the provisions of 30 CFR 250.174.
              (f) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. If, during the review of the information required under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of an onshore area of the State.
              (g) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from the facility following the installation of emission controls. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
              (h) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit meteorological data from a facility.

              Leasing maps and diagrams.
              (a) Any area of the OCS, which has been appropriately platted as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, may be leased for any mineral not included in an existing lease issued under the Act or meeting the requirements of subsection (a) of section 6 of the Act. Before any lease is offered or issued an area may be:
              (1) Withdrawn from disposition pursuant to section 12(a) of the Act; or
              (2) Designated as an area or part of an area restricted from operation under section 12(d) of the Act.
              (b) BOEM will prepare leasing maps and official protraction diagrams of areas of the OCS. The areas included in each mineral lease will be in accordance with the appropriate leasing map or official protraction diagram.

              § 550.1011
              Bond requirements for pipeline right-of-way holders.
              (a) When you apply for, or are the holder of, a right-of-way, you must:
              (1) Provide and maintain a $300,000 bond (in addition to the bond coverage required in 30 CFR part 256 and 30 CFR part 556) that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the rights-of-way you hold in an OCS area; and
              (2) Provide additional security if the Regional Director determines that a bond in excess of $300,000 is needed.
              (b) For the purpose of this paragraph, there are three areas:
              (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast;
              (2) The areas offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
              (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.
              (c) If, as the result of a default, the surety on a right-of-way grant bond makes payment to the Government of any indebtedness under a grant secured by the bond, the face amount of such bond and the surety's liability shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.
              (d) After a default, a new bond in the amount of $300,000 shall be posted within 6 months or such shorter period as the Regional Supervisor may direct. Failure to post a new bond shall be grounds for forfeiture of all grants covered by the defaulted bond.

              Classifying Reservoirs
              
                § 550.1154
                How do I determine if my reservoir is sensitive?
                (a) You must determine whether each reservoir is sensitive. You must classify the reservoir as sensitive if:
                (1) Under initial conditions it is an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap;
                (2) At any time there are near-critical fluids; or
                (3) The reservoir is undergoing enhanced recovery.
                (b) For the purposes of this subpart, near-critical fluids are:
                (1) Those fluids that occur in high temperature, high-pressure reservoirs where it is not possible to define the liquid-gas contact; or
                (2) Fluids in reservoirs that are near bubble point or dew point conditions.
                (c) The Regional Supervisor may reclassify a reservoir when available information warrants reclassification.
                (d) If available information indicates that a reservoir previously classified as non-sensitive is now sensitive, you must submit a request to the Regional Supervisor to reclassify the reservoir. You must include supporting information, as listed in the table in § 550.1167, with your request.
                (e) If information indicates that a reservoir previously classified as sensitive is now non-sensitive, you may submit a request to the Regional Supervisor to reclassify the reservoir. You must include supporting information, as listed in the table in § 550.1167, with your request.
              
              
                § 550.1155
                What information must I submit for sensitive reservoirs?
                You must submit to the Regional Supervisor an original and two copies of Form BOEM-0127; one of the copies must be a public information copy in accordance with §§ 550.186 and 550.197, and marked “Public Information.” You must also submit two copies of the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 550.1167. You must submit this information:
                (a) Within 45 days after beginning production from the reservoir or discovering that it is sensitive;
                (b) At least once during the calendar year, but you do not need to resubmit unrevised structure maps (§ 550.1167(a)(2)) or previously submitted well logs (§ 550.1167(c)(1));
                (c) Within 45 days after you revise reservoir parameters; and
                (d) Within 45 days after the Regional Supervisor classifies the reservoir as sensitive under § 550.1154(c).

                § 550.1408
                When will I be notified of the Reviewing Officer's decision?
                At the end of the 30 calendar days or after the meeting and submittal of additional information, the Reviewing Officer will review the case file, including all information you submitted, and send you a decision. The decision will include the amount of any final civil penalty, the basis for the civil penalty, and instructions for paying or appealing the civil penalty.
              
              
                § 550.1409
                What are my appeal rights?
                (a) When you receive the Reviewing Officer's final decision, you have 60 days to either pay the penalty or file an appeal in accordance with 30 CFR part 590, subpart A.
                (b) If you file an appeal, you must either:
                (1) Submit a surety bond in the amount of the penalty to the appropriate Leasing Office in the Region where the penalty was assessed, following instructions that the Reviewing Officer will include in the final decision; or
                (2) Notify the appropriate Leasing Office, in the Region where the penalty was assessed, that you want your lease-specific/area-wide bond on file to be used as the bond for the penalty amount.

                (c) If you choose the alternative in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the BOEM Regional Director may require additional security (i.e., security in excess of your existing bond) to ensure sufficient coverage during an appeal. In that event, the Regional Director will require you to post the supplemental bond with the regional office in the same manner as under § 556.53(d) through (f) of this chapter. If the Regional Director determines the appeal should be covered by a lease-specific abandonment account then you must establish an account that meets the requirements of § 556.56.
                (d) If you do not either pay the penalty or file a timely appeal, BOEM will take one or more of the following actions:
                (1) We will collect the amount you were assessed, plus interest, late payment charges, and other fees as provided by law, from the date you received the Reviewing Officer's final decision until the date we receive payment;
                (2) We may initiate additional enforcement, including, if appropriate, cancellation of the lease, right-of-way, license, permit, or approval, or the forfeiture of a bond under this part; or
                (3) We may bar you from doing further business with the Federal Government according to Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, 31 U.S.C. 6101. The Department of the Interior's regulations implementing these authorities are found at 43 CFR part 12, subpart D.

The Notice of Civil Penalty will tell you how much penalty you must pay. The penalty may be up to $500 per day, beginning with the date of the Notice of Noncompliance, for each violation identified in the Notice of Noncompliance for as long as you do not correct the violations.
                (b) If you do not correct all of the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance within 40 days after you receive the Notice of Noncompliance (or 20 days following the expiration of a longer time period specified in that Notice), we may increase the penalty to up to $5,000 per day, beginning with the date of the Notice of Noncompliance, for each violation for as long as you do not correct the violations.
              
              
                § 550.1454
                How may I request a hearing on the record on a Notice of Noncompliance?
                You may request a hearing on the record on a Notice of Noncompliance by filing a request within 30 days of the date you received the Notice of Noncompliance with the Hearings Division (Departmental), Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, 351 South West Temple, Suite 6.300, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101. You may do this regardless of whether you correct the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance.

                § 550.1455
                Does my request for a hearing on the record affect the penalties?
                (a) If you do not correct the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance, the penalties will continue to accrue even if you request a hearing on the record.
                (b) You may petition the Hearings Division (Departmental) of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, to stay the accrual of penalties pending the hearing on the record and a decision by the Administrative Law Judge under § 550.1472.
                (1) You must file your petition within 45 calendar days of receiving the Notice of Noncompliance.
                (2) To stay the accrual of penalties, you must post a bond or other surety instrument, or demonstrate financial solvency, using the standards and requirements as prescribed in §§ 550.1490 through 550.1497, for the principal amount of any unpaid amounts due that are the subject of the Notice of Noncompliance, including interest thereon, plus the amount of any penalties accrued before the date a stay becomes effective.
                (3) The Hearings Division will grant or deny the petition under 43 CFR 4.21(b).

                May I request a hearing on the record regarding the amount of a civil penalty if I did not request a hearing on the Notice of Noncompliance?
                (a) You may request a hearing on the record to challenge only the amount of a civil penalty when you receive a Notice of Civil Penalty, if you did not previously request a hearing on the record under § 550.1454.

                Does my request for a hearing on the record affect the penalties?
                (a) If you do not correct the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance regarding violations without a period to correct, the penalties will continue to accrue even if you request a hearing on the record.
                (b) You may ask the Hearings Division (Departmental) to stay the accrual of penalties pending the hearing on the record and a decision by the Administrative Law Judge under § 550.1472.
                (1) You must file your petition within 45 calendar days after you receive the Notice of Noncompliance.
                (2) To stay the accrual of penalties, you must post a bond or other surety instrument, or demonstrate financial solvency, using the standards and requirements as prescribed in §§ 550.1490 through 550.1497, for the principal amount of any unpaid amounts due that are the subject of the Notice of Noncompliance, including interest thereon, plus the amount of any penalties accrued before the date a stay becomes effective.

                (a) You may request a hearing on the record to challenge only the amount of a civil penalty when you receive a Notice of Civil Penalty regarding violations without a period to correct, if you did not previously request a hearing on the record under § 550.1462. If you did not request a hearing on the record on the Notice of Noncompliance under § 550.1462, you may not contest your underlying liability for civil penalties.

                § 550.1470
                How does BOEM decide what the amount of the penalty should be?

                (a) You must pay the amount of the Notice of Civil Penalty issued under § 550.1453 or § 550.1461, if you do not request a hearing on the record under § 550.1454, § 550.1456, § 550.1462, or § 550.1464
                (b) If you request a hearing on the record under § 550.1454, § 550.1456, § 550.1462, or § 550.1464, but you do not appeal the determination of the Administrative Law Judge to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under § 550.1473, you must pay the amount assessed by the Administrative Law Judge.
                (c) If you appeal the determination of the Administrative Law Judge to the Interior Board of Land Appeals, you must pay the amount assessed in the IBLA decision.

                (2) You received an Administrative Law Judge's decision under § 550.1472, if you obtained a stay of the accrual of penalties pending the hearing on the record under § 550.1455(b) or § 550.1463(b) and did not appeal the Administrative Law Judge's determination to the IBLA under § 550.1473;

                (3) You received an IBLA decision under § 550.1473 if the IBLA continued the stay of accrual of penalties pending its decision and you did not seek judicial review of the IBLA's decision; or
                
                (4) A final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is entered, if you sought judicial review of the IBLA's decision and the Department or the appropriate court suspended compliance with the IBLA's decision pending the adjudication of the case.
                (e) If you do not pay, that amount is subject to collection under the provisions of § 550.1477.
              
              
                § 550.1476
                Can BOEM reduce my penalty once it is assessed?

                (b) If the Department uses judicial process, or if you seek judicial review under § 550.1474 and the court upholds assessment of a penalty, the court shall have jurisdiction to award the amount assessed plus interest assessed from the date of the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in § 550.1474. The amount of any penalty, as finally determined, may be deducted from any sum owing to you by the United States.

                § 550.1490
                What standards must my BOEM-specified surety instrument meet?
                (a) A BOEM-specified surety instrument must be in a form specified in BOEM instructions. BOEM will give you written information and standard forms for BOEM-specified surety instrument requirements.
                (b) BOEM will use a bank-rating service to determine whether a financial institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety instrument adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage.
                (1) Administrative appeal bonds must be issued by a qualified surety company which the Department of the Treasury has approved.
                (2) Irrevocable letters of credit or certificates of deposit must be from a financial institution acceptable to BOEM with a minimum 1-year period of coverage subject to automatic renewal up to 5 years.
              
              
                § 550.1491
                How will BOEM determine the amount of my bond or other surety instrument?
                (a) BOEM bond-approving officer may approve your surety if he or she determines that the amount is adequate to guarantee payment. The amount of your surety may vary depending on the form of the surety and how long the surety is effective.
                (1) The amount of the BOEM-specified surety instrument must include the principal amount owed under the Notice of Noncompliance or Notice of Civil Penalty plus any accrued interest we determine is owed plus projected interest for a 1-year period.
                (2) Treasury book-entry bond or note amounts must be equal to at least 120 percent of the required surety amount.

                (b) If your appeal is not decided within 1 year from the filing date, you must increase the surety amount to cover additional estimated interest for another 1-year period. You must continue to do this annually on the date your appeal was filed. We will determine the additional estimated interest and notify you of the amount so you can amend your surety instrument.
                
                (c) You may submit a single surety instrument that covers multiple appeals. You may change the instrument to add new amounts under appeal or remove amounts that have been adjudicated in your favor or that you have paid, if you:
                (1) Amend the single surety instrument annually on the date you filed your first appeal; and
                (2) Submit a separate surety instrument for new amounts under appeal until you amend the instrument to cover the new appeals.

                (c) If you demonstrate financial solvency in the current calendar year, you are not required to redemonstrate financial solvency for new appeals of orders during that calendar year unless you file for protection under any provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code), or BOEM notifies you that you must redemonstrate financial solvency.

                § 550.1496
                How will BOEM determine if I am financially solvent?
                (a) BOEM bond-approving officer will determine your financial solvency by examining your total net worth, including, as appropriate, the net worth of your affiliated entities.
                (b) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491 for all orders you have appealed is greater than $300 million, you are presumptively deemed financially solvent, and we will not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument.
                (c) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491 for all orders you have appealed is less than $300 million, you must submit the following to BOEM by one of the methods in § 550.1495(a):
                (1) A written request asking us to consult a business-information, or credit-reporting service or program to determine your financial solvency; and
                (2) A nonrefundable $50 processing fee:
                (i) You must pay the processing fee to us following the requirements for making payments found in 30 CFR 550.126. You are required to use Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for these payments;
                (ii) You must submit the fee with your request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and then annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency, as long as you are not able to demonstrate financial solvency under paragraph (a) of this section and you have active appeals.
                (d) If you request that we consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under paragraph (c) of this section:
                (1) We will use criteria similar to that which a potential creditor would use to lend an amount equal to the bond or other surety instrument we would require under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491;

                (2) For us to consider you financially solvent, the business-information or credit-reporting service or program must demonstrate your degree of risk as low to moderate:
                
                (i) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-information or credit-reporting service or program information demonstrates your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-approving officer will not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491;
                (ii) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-information or credit-reporting service or program information does not demonstrate your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-approving officer will require you to post a bond or other surety instrument under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491 or pay the obligation.
              
              
                § 550.1497
                When will BOEM monitor my financial solvency?
                (a) If you are presumptively financially solvent under § 550.1496(b), BOEM will determine your net worth as described under §§ 550.1496(b) and (c) to evaluate your financial solvency at least annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.
                (b) If you ask us to consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under § 550.1496(c), we will consult a service or program annually as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.
                (c) If our bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer financially solvent, you must post a bond or other BOEM-specified surety instrument under §§ 550.1490 and 550.1491.

            § 551.13
            Reimbursement for the costs of reproducing data and information and certain processing costs.
            (a) BOEM will reimburse you or a third party for reasonable costs of reproducing data and information that the Regional Director requests if:
            (1) You deliver G&G data and information to BOEM for the Regional Director to inspect or select and retain (according to § 551.11 or § 551.12);
            (2) BOEM receives your request for reimbursement and the Regional Director determines that the requested reimbursement is proper; and
            (3) The cost is at your lowest rate (or a third party's) or at the lowest commercial rate established in the area, whichever is less.
            (b) BOEM will reimburse you or the third party for the reasonable costs of processing geophysical information (which does not include cost of data acquisition):
            (1) If, at the request of the Regional Director, you processed the geophysical data or information in a form or manner other than that used in the normal conduct of business; or
            (2) If you collected the information under a permit that BOEM issued to you before October 1, 1985, and the Regional Director requests and retains the information.
            (c) When you request reimbursement, you must identify reproduction and processing costs separately from acquisition costs.
            (d) BOEM will not reimburse you or a third party for data acquisition costs or for the costs of analyzing or processing geological information or interpreting geological or geophysical information.
          
          
            § 551.14
            Protecting and disclosing data and information submitted to BOEM under a permit.
            (a) Disclosure of data and information to the public by BOEM. (1) In making data and information available to the public, the Regional Director will follow the applicable requirements of:
            (i) The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
            (ii) The implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2;
            (iii) The Act; and
            (iv) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550 and 552.
            (2) Except as specified in this section or in 30 CFR parts 550 and 552, if the Regional Director determines any data or information is exempt from public disclosure under this paragraph (a), BOEM will not provide the data and information to any State or to the executive of any local government or to the public, unless you and all third parties agree to the disclosure.
            (3) BOEM will keep confidential the identity of third party recipients of data and information collected under a permit. BOEM will not release the identity unless you and the third parties agree to the disclosure.

            (4) When you detect any significant hydrocarbon occurrences or environmental hazards on unleased lands during drilling operations, the Regional Director will immediately issue a public announcement. The announcement must further the National interest, but without unduly damaging your competitive position.
            
            (b) Timetable for release of G&G data and information related to oil, gas, and sulphur that BOEM acquires. Except for high-resolution data and information released under 30 CFR 550.197(b)(2), BOEM will release or disclose acquired data and information in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section.
            (1) If the data and information are not related to a deep stratigraphic test, BOEM will release them to the public in accordance with the following table:
            
              
                If you or a third party submit and BOEM retains . . .
                The Regional Director will release them to the public . . .
              
              
                (i) Geological data and information,
                10 years after BOEM issued the permit.
              
              
                (ii) Geophysical data,
                50 years after BOEM issued the permit.
              
              
                (iii) Geophysical information processed or reprocessed less than 20 years after BOEM issued the germane permit,
                25 years after BOEM issued the permit.
              
              
                (iv) Geophysical information processed or reprocessed 20 or more years after BOEM issued the germane permit,
                25 years after BOEM issued the permit; or, if you or a third party applied for an extension of the proprietary term, 5 years after BOEM approved the application for an extension. In any case BOEM will release the information no later than 50 years after BOEM issued the permit.
              
            
            (2) Permittees and third parties may apply to BOEM for an extension of the 25-year proprietary term for geophysical information reprocessed 20 or more years after BOEM issued the germane permit. You must submit the application to BOEM within 90 days after completion of the reprocessing, except during the initial 1-year grace period as provided in paragraph (b)(5) below. Filing locations are listed in § 551.5(d). Your application must include:
            (i) Name and address of the permittee or third party;
            (ii) Product name;
            (iii) Identification of the geophysical information area;
            (iv) Identification of originating permit number and date;
            (v) Description of reprocessing performed;
            (vi) Identification of the date of completion of reprocessing the geophysical information;
            (vii) Certification that the product meets the definition of processed geophysical information and that all other information in the application is accurate; and
            (viii) Signature and date.
            (3) With each new reprocessing of permitted data, you may apply for an extension of up to 5 years. However, the maximum proprietary term for geophysical information is 50 years after the permit was issued. Once the maximum term is reached, the BOEM Regional Director will release the information to the public.
            (4) Geophysical information processed or reprocessed 20 or more years after the germane permit was issued and granted the extension will be subject to submission, inspection, and selection criteria under § 551.12 and reimbursement criteria identified under § 551.13.
            (5) There was a 1-year grace period, that started September 14, 2009, that allowed permittees and third parties sufficient time to meet the above requirements and apply for all eligible extensions. During that time, BOEM did not release geophysical information which was reprocessed 20 or more years after the date that the germane permit was issued.
            (6) Since September 14, 2010, BOEM has resumed releasing eligible reprocessed information. If an application for extension was not filed, not filed on time, or not approved by BOEM, the original 25-year proprietary term applies to the release date of the reprocessed geophysical information.
            (7) If the data and information are related to a deep stratigraphic test, BOEM will release them to the public at the earlier of the following times:
            (i) Twenty-five years after you complete the test; or
            (ii) If a lease sale is held after you complete a test well, 60-calendar days after BOEM issues the first lease, any portion of which is located within 50 geographic miles (92.7 kilometers) of the test.

            (8) BOEM may allow limited inspection, but only by persons with a direct interest in related BOEM decisions and issues in specific geographic areas, and who agree in writing to its confidentiality, of G&G data and information submitted under this part that BOEM uses to:
            (i) Make unitization determinations on two or more leases;
            (ii) Make competitive reservoir determinations;
            (iii) Ensure proper plans of development for competitive reservoirs;
            (iv) Promote operational safety;
            (v) Protect the environment;
            (vi) Make field determinations; or
            (vii) Determine eligibility for royalty relief.
            (c) Procedure that BOEM follows to disclose acquired data and information to a contractor for reproduction, processing, and interpretation. (1) When practical, the Regional Director will advise the person who submitted data and information under § 551.11 or § 551.12 of the intent to disclose the data or information to an independent contractor or agent.
            (2) The person so notified will have at least 5 working days to comment on the action.
            (3) When the Regional Director advises the person who submitted the data and information, all other owners of the data or information will be considered to have been so notified.
            (4) Before disclosure, the contractor or agent must sign a written commitment not to sell, trade, license, or disclose data or information to anyone without the Regional Director's consent.
            (d) Sharing data and information with coastal States. (1) When BOEM solicits nominations for leasing lands located within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, the Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 552.7(a)(4) and (b) and subsections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will provide the Governor with:
            (i) All information on the geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of the areas and regions BOEM proposes to offer for lease;
            (ii) An estimate of the oil and gas reserves in the areas proposed for leasing; and
            (iii) An identification of any field, geological structure, or trap on the OCS within 3 geographic miles (5.6 kilometers) of the seaward boundary of the State.
            (2) After receiving nominations for leasing an area of the OCS within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of any coastal State, BOEM will carry out a tentative area identification according to 30 CFR part 556, subparts D and E. At that time, the Regional Director will consult with the Governor to determine whether any tracts further considered for leasing may contain any oil or gas reservoirs that underlie both the OCS and lands subject to the jurisdiction of the State.
            (3) Before a sale, if a Governor requests, the Regional Director, in accordance with 30 CFR 552.7(a)(4) and (b) and sections 8(g) and 26(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g) and 1352(e)), will share with the Governor information that identifies potential and/or proven common hydrocarbon bearing areas within 3 geographic miles of the seaward boundary of that State.
            (4) Information received and knowledge gained by a State official under paragraph (d) of this section is subject to applicable confidentiality requirements of:
            (i) The Act; and
            (ii) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550, 551, and 552.

The cost shall be computed and paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
            (2) Whenever a lessee or permittee provides any data or information, at the request of the Director and specifically for use in the OCS Oil and Gas Information Program, in a form and manner of processing not normally utilized by the lessee or permittee in the normal conduct of business, the Director shall pay the lessee or permittee, if the lessee or permittee requests reimbursement, the reasonable cost of processing and reproducing the requested data and information. The cost is to be computed and paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
            (c) Data or information requested by the Director shall be provided as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days following receipt of the Director's request, unless, for good reason, the Director authorizes a longer time period for the submission of the requested data or information.

            (d) The Director reserves the right to disclose any data or information acquired from a lessee or permittee to an independent contractor or agent for the purpose of reproducing, processing, reprocessing, or interpreting such data or information. When practicable, the Director shall notify the lessee(s) or permittee(s) who provided the data or information of the intent to disclose the data or information to an independent contractor or agent. The Director's notice of intent will afford the permittee(s) or lessee(s) a period of not less than 5 working days within which to comment on the intended action. When the Director so notifies a lessee or permittee of the intent to disclose data or information to an independent contractor or agent, all other owners of such data or information shall be deemed to have been notified of the Director's intent. Prior to any such disclosure, the contractor or agent shall be required to execute a written commitment not to disclose any data or information to anyone without the express consent of the Director, and not to make any disclosure or use of the data or information other than that provided in the contract. Contracts between BOEM and independent contractors shall be available to the lessee(s) or permittee(s) for inspection. In the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information by the contractor or agent, or by an employee thereof, the responsible contractor or agent or employee thereof shall be liable for penalties pursuant to section 24 of the Act.
            (e)(1) After delivery of data or information in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and upon receipt of a request for reimbursement and a determination by the Director that the requested reimbursement is proper, the lessee or permittee shall be reimbursed for the cost of reproducing the data or information at the lessee's or permittee's lowest rate or at the lowest commercial rate established in the area, whichever is less. Requests for reimbursement must be made within 60 days of the delivery date of the data or information requested under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
            (2) After delivery of data or information in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and upon receipt of a request for reimbursement and a determination by the Director that the requested reimbursement is proper, the lessee or permittee shall be reimbursed for the cost of processing or reprocessing and of reproducing the requested data or information. Requests for reimbursement must be made within 60 days of the delivery date of the data or information and shall be for only the costs attributable to processing or reprocessing and reproducing, as distinguished from the costs of data acquisition.
            (3) Requests for reimbursement are to contain a breakdown of costs in sufficient detail to allow separation of reproduction, processing, and reprocessing costs from acquisition and other costs.
            (f) Each Federal Department or Agency shall provide the Director with any data which it has obtained pursuant to section 11 of the Act and any other information which may be necessary or useful to assist the Director in carrying out the provisions of the Act.

              § 553.14
              How do I determine the worst case oil-spill discharge volume?
              (a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a facility under § 553.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following regulations applies:
              (1) 30 CFR part 254—Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume that you estimate for the first 24 hours.
              (2) 40 CFR part 112—Oil Pollution Prevention; or
              (3) 49 CFR part 194—Response Plans for Onshore Oil Pipelines.
              (b) If you are a designated applicant and you choose to demonstrate $150 million in OSFR, you are not required to determine any worst case oil-spill discharge volumes, since that is the maximum amount of OSFR required under this part.
            
            
              § 553.15
              What are my general OSFR compliance responsibilities?
              (a) You must maintain continuous OSFR coverage for all your leases, permits, and RUEs with COFs for which you are the designated applicant.
              (b) You must ensure that new OSFR evidence is submitted before your current evidence lapses or is canceled and that coverage for your new COF is submitted before the COF goes into operation.
              (c) If you use self-insurance to demonstrate OSFR and find that you no longer qualify to self-insure the required OSFR amount based upon your latest audited annual financial statements, then you must demonstrate OSFR using other methods acceptable to BOEM by whichever of the following dates comes first:
              (1) Sixty calendar days after you receive your latest audited annual financial statement; or
              (2) The first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your fiscal year.
              (d) You may use a surety bond to demonstrate OSFR. If you find that your bonding company has lost its state license or has had its U.S. Treasury Department certification revoked, then you must replace the surety bond within 15 calendar days using a method of OSFR that is acceptable to BOEM.
              (e) You must notify BOEM in writing within 15 calendar days after a change occurs that would prevent you from meeting your OSFR obligations (e.g., if you or your indemnitor petition for bankruptcy under chapters 7 or 11 of Title 11, U.S.C.). You must take any action BOEM directs to ensure an acceptable OSFR demonstration.
              (f) If you deny payment of a claim presented to you under § 553.60, then you must give the claimant a written explanation for your denial.

              § 553.20
              What methods may I use to demonstrate OSFR?
              As the designated applicant, you may satisfy your OSFR requirements by using one or a combination of the following methods to demonstrate OSFR:
              (a) Self-insurance under §§ 553.21 through 553.28;
              (b) Insurance under § 553.29;
              (c) An indemnity under § 553.30;
              (d) A surety bond under § 553.31; or

              § 553.21
              How can I use self-insurance as OSFR evidence?
              (a) If you use self-insurance to satisfy all or part of your obligation to demonstrate OSFR, you must annually pass either a net worth test under § 553.25 or an unencumbered net asset test under § 553.28.
              (b) To establish the amount of self-insurance allowed, you must submit evidence of your net worth under § 553.23 or evidence of your unencumbered assets under § 553.26.
              (c) You must identify a U.S. agent for service of process.
            
            
              § 553.22
              How do I apply to use self-insurance as OSFR evidence?

              (a) You must submit a complete Form BOEM-1018 with each application to demonstrate OSFR using self-insurance.
              
              (b) You must submit your application to renew OSFR using self-insurance by the first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your fiscal year. You may submit to BOEM your initial application to demonstrate OSFR using self-insurance at any time.
            
            
              § 553.23
              What information must I submit to support my net worth demonstration?
              You must support your net worth evaluation with information contained in your previous fiscal year's audited annual financial statement.
              (a) Audited annual financial statements must be in the form of:
              (1) An annual report, prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP) of the United States or other international accounting practices determined to be equivalent by BOEM; or
              (2) A Form 10-K or Form 20-F, prepared in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.
              (b) Audited annual financial statements must be submitted together with a letter signed by your treasurer highlighting:
              (1) The State or the country of incorporation;
              (2) The total amount of the stockholders' equity as shown on the balance sheet;
              (3) The net amount of the plant, property, and equipment shown on the balance sheet; and

              § 553.24
              When I submit audited annual financial statements to verify my net worth, what standards must they meet?
              (a) Your audited annual financial statements must be bound.
              (b) Your audited annual financial statements must include the unqualified opinion of an independent accountant that states:
              (1) The financial statements are free from material misstatement, and
              (2) The audit was conducted in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) of the United States, or other international auditing standards that BOEM determines to be equivalent.
              (c) The financial information you submit must be expressed in U.S. dollars. If this information was originally reported in another form of currency, you must convert it to U.S. dollars using the conversion factor that was effective on the last day of the fiscal year pertinent to your financial statements. You also must identify the source of the currency exchange rate.
            
            
              § 553.25
              What financial test procedures must I use to determine the amount of self-insurance allowed as OSFR evidence based on net worth?
              (a) Divide the total amount of the stockholders'/owners' equity listed on the balance sheet by ten.
              (b) Divide the net amount of the identifiable U.S. assets by the net amount of the identifiable total assets.
              (c) Multiply the net amount of plant, property, and equipment shown on the balance sheet by the number calculated under paragraph (b) of this section and divide the resultant product by ten.
              (d) The smaller of the numbers calculated under paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section is the maximum allowable amount you may use to demonstrate OSFR under this method.
            
            
              § 553.26
              What information must I submit to support my unencumbered assets demonstration?
              You must support your unencumbered assets evaluation with the information required by § 553.23(a) and a list of reserved, unencumbered, and unimpaired U.S. assets whose value will not be affected by an oil discharge from a COF. The assets must be plant, property, or equipment held for use. You must submit a letter signed by your treasurer:
              (a) Identifying which assets are reserved;
              (b) Certifying that the assets are unencumbered, including contingent encumbrances;
              (c) Promising that the identified assets will not be sold, subjected to a security interest, or otherwise encumbered throughout the specified fiscal year; and

The net value of the reserved assets must be at least two times the self-insurance amount requested for demonstration.
            
            
              § 553.27
              When I submit audited annual financial statements to verify my unencumbered assets, what standards must they meet?
              Any audited annual financial statements that you submit must:
              (a) Meet the standards in § 553.24; and
              (b) Include a certification by the independent accountant who audited the financial statements that states:
              (1) The value of the unencumbered assets is reasonable and uses the same valuation method used in your audited annual financial statements;
              (2) Any existing encumbrances are noted;
              (3) The assets are long-term assets held for use; and
              (4) The valuation method used in the audited annual financial statements is for long-term assets held for use.
            
            
              § 553.28
              What financial test procedures must I use to evaluate the amount of self-insurance allowed as OSFR evidence based on unencumbered assets?
              (a) Divide the total amount of the stockholders'/owners' equity listed on the balance sheet by 4.
              (b) Divide the value of the unencumbered U.S. assets by 2.
              (c) The smaller number calculated under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section is the maximum allowable amount you may use to demonstrate OSFR under this method.
            
            
              § 553.29
              How can I use insurance as OSFR evidence?
              (a) If you use insurance to satisfy all or part of your obligation to demonstrate OSFR, you may use only insurance certificates issued by insurers that have achieved a “Secure” rating for claims paying ability in their latest review by A.M. Best's Insurance Reports, Standard & Poor's Insurance Rating Services, or other equivalent rating made by a rating service acceptable to BOEM.
              (b) You must submit information about your insurers to BOEM on a completed and unaltered Form BOEM-1019. The information you submit must:
              (1) Include all the information required by § 553.41 and

              (2) Be executed on one original insurance certificate (i.e., Form BOEM-1019) for each OSFR layer (see paragraph (c) of this section), showing all participating insurers and their proportion (quota share) of this risk. The certificate must bear the original signatures of each insurer's underwriter or of their lead underwriters, underwriting managers, or delegated brokers, depending on who is authorized to bind the underwriter.
              (3) For each insurance company on the insurance certificate, indicate the insurer's claims-paying-ability rating and the rating service that issued the rating.
              (c) The insurance evidence you provide to BOEM as OSFR evidence may be divided into layers, subject to the following restrictions:
              (1) The total amount of OSFR evidence must equal the total amount you must demonstrate under § 553.13;

              (2) No more than one insurance certificate may be used to cover each OSFR layer specified in § 553.13(b) (i.e., four layers for an OCS COF, and five layers for a non-OCS COF);
              (3) You may use one insurance certificate to cover any number of consecutive OSFR layers;
              (4) Each insurer's participation in the covered insurance risk must be on a proportional (quota share) basis, must be expressed as a percentage of a whole layer, and the certificate must not contain intermediate, horizontal layers;

              (5) You may use an insurance deductible. If you use more than one insurance certificate, the deductible amount must apply only to the certificate that covers the base OSFR amount layer. To satisfy an insurance deductible, you may use only those methods that are acceptable as evidence of OSFR under this part; and
              (6) You must identify a U.S. agent for service of process on each insurance certificate you submit to BOEM. The agent may be different for each insurance certificate.
              (d) You may submit to BOEM a temporary insurance confirmation (fax binder) for each insurance certificate you use as OSFR evidence. Submit your fax binder on Form BOEM-1019, and each form must include the signature of an underwriter for at least one of the participating insurers. BOEM will accept your fax binder as OSFR evidence during a period that ends 90 days after the date that you need the insurance to demonstrate OSFR.
            
            
              § 553.30
              How can I use an indemnity as OSFR evidence?
              (a) You may use only one indemnity issued by only one indemnitor to satisfy all or part of your obligation to demonstrate OSFR.
              (b) Your indemnitor must be your corporate parent or affiliate.
              (c) Your indemnitor must complete a Form BOEM-1018 and provide an indemnity that:
              (1) Includes all the information required by § 553.41; and
              (2) Does not exceed the amounts calculated using the net worth or unencumbered assets tests specified under §§ 553.21 through 553.28.
              (d) You must submit your application to renew OSFR using an indemnity by the first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your indemnitor's fiscal year. You may submit to BOEM your initial application to demonstrate OSFR using an indemnity at any time.
              (e) Your indemnitor must identify a U.S. agent for service of process.
            
            
              § 553.31
              How can I use a surety bond as OSFR evidence?
              (a) Each bonding company that issues a surety bond that you submit to BOEM as OSFR evidence must:
              (1) Be licensed to do business in the State in which the surety bond is executed;
              (2) Be certified by the U.S. Treasury Department as an acceptable surety for Federal obligations and listed in the current Treasury Circular No. 570;
              (3) Provide the surety bond on Form BOEM-1020; and
              (4) Be in compliance with applicable statutes regulating surety company participation in insurance-type risks.
              (b) A surety bond that you submit as OSFR evidence must include all the information required by § 553.41.
            
            
              § 553.32
              Are there alternative methods to demonstrate OSFR?
              The Director may accept other methods to demonstrate OSFR that provide equivalent assurance of timely satisfaction of claims. This may include pooling, letters of credit, pledges of treasury notes, or other comparable methods. Submit your proposal, together with all the supporting documents, to the Director at the address listed in § 553.45. The Director's decision whether to approve your alternative method to evidence OSFR is by this rule committed to the Director's sole discretion and is not subject to administrative appeal under 30 CFR part 590 or 43 CFR part 4.

              (3) BOEM forms that identify your COFs (Form BOEM-1021, Form BOEM-1022), and the methods you will use to demonstrate OSFR (Form BOEM-1018, Form BOEM-1019, Form BOEM-1020). Forms are available from the address listed in § 553.45;
              (4) Any insurance certificates, indemnities, and surety bonds used as OSFR evidence for the COFs for which you are the designated applicant;
              (5) A completed Form BOEM-1017 for each responsible party, unless you are the only responsible party for the COFs covered by your OSFR demonstration; and

              (6) Other financial instruments and information the Director requires to support your OSFR demonstration under § 553.32.
              
              (b) Each BOEM form you submit to BOEM as part of your OSFR demonstration must be signed. You also must attach to Form BOEM-1016 proof of your authority to sign.
            
            
              § 553.41
              What terms must I include in my OSFR evidence?
              (a) Each instrument you submit as OSFR evidence must specify:
              (1) The effective date, and except for a surety bond, the expiration date;

              (2) That termination of the instrument will not affect the liability of the instrument issuer for claims arising from an incident (i.e., oil-spill discharge or substantial threat of the discharge of oil) that occurred on or before the effective date of termination;
              (3) That the instrument will remain in force until the termination date or until the earlier of:
              (i) Thirty calendar days after BOEM and the designated applicant receive from the instrument issuer a notification of intent to cancel; or
              (ii) BOEM receives from the designated applicant other acceptable OSFR evidence; or
              (iii) All the COFs to which the instrument applies are permanently abandoned in compliance with 30 CFR part 250 or equivalent State requirements;
              (4) That the instrument issuer agrees to direct action for claims made under OPA up to the guaranty amount, subject to the defenses in paragraph (a)(6) of this section and following the procedures in § 553.60 of this part;
              (5) An agent in the United States for service of process; and
              (6) That the instrument issuer will not use any defenses against a claim made under OPA except:
              (i) The rights and defenses that would be available to a designated applicant or responsible party for whom the guaranty was provided; and
              (ii) The incident (i.e., oil-spill discharge or a substantial threat of the discharge of oil) leading to the claim for removal costs or damages was caused by willful misconduct of a responsible party for whom the designated applicant demonstrated OSFR.
              (b) You may not change, omit, or add limitations or exceptions to the terms and conditions in a BOEM form that you submit as part of your OSFR demonstration. If you attempt to do this, BOEM will disregard the changes, omissions, additions, limitations, or exceptions and by operation of this rule BOEM will consider the form to contain all the terms and conditions included on the original BOEM form.
            
            
              § 553.42
              How can I amend my list of COFs?
              (a) If you want to add a COF that is not identified in your current OSFR demonstration, you must submit to BOEM a completed Form BOEM-1022. If applicable, you also must submit any additional indemnities, surety bonds, insurance certificates, or other instruments required to extend the coverage of your original OSFR demonstration to the COFs to be added. You do not need to resubmit previously accepted audited annual financial statements for the current fiscal year.
              (b) If you want to drop a COF identified in your current OSFR demonstration, you must submit to BOEM a completed Form BOEM-1022. You must continue to demonstrate OSFR for the COF until BOEM approves OSFR evidence for the COF from another designated applicant, or OSFR is no longer required (e.g., until a well that is a COF is properly plugged and abandoned).
            
            
              § 553.43
              When is my OSFR demonstration or the amendment to my OSFR demonstration effective?
              (a) BOEM will notify you in writing when we approve your OSFR demonstration. If we find that you have not submitted all the information needed to demonstrate OSFR, we may require you to provide additional information before we determine whether your OSFR evidence is acceptable.
              (b) Except in the case of self-insurance or an indemnity, BOEM acceptance of OSFR evidence is valid until the surety bond, insurance certificate, or other accepted OSFR instrument expires or is canceled. In the case of self-insurance or indemnity, acceptance is valid until the first day of the 5th month after the close of your or your indemnitor's current fiscal year.

            Subpart E—Revocation and Penalties
            
              § 553.50
              How can BOEM refuse or invalidate my OSFR evidence?
              (a) If BOEM determines that any OSFR evidence you submit fails to comply with the requirements of this part, we may not accept it. If we do not accept your OSFR evidence, then we will send you a written notification stating:
              (1) That your evidence is not acceptable;
              (2) Why your evidence is unacceptable; and
              (3) The amount of time you are allowed to submit acceptable evidence without being subject to civil penalty under § 553.51.
              (b) BOEM may immediately and without prior notice invalidate your OSFR demonstration if you:
              (1) Are no longer eligible to be the designated applicant for a COF included in your demonstration; or
              (2) Permit the cancellation or termination of the insurance policy, surety bond, or indemnity upon which the continued validity of the demonstration is based.
              (c) If BOEM determines you are not complying with the requirements of this part for any reason other than paragraph (b) of this section, we will notify you of our intent to invalidate your OSFR demonstration and specify the corrective action needed. Unless you take the corrective action BOEM specifies within 15 calendar days from the date you receive such a notice, we will invalidate your OSFR demonstration.
            
            
              § 553.51
              What are the penalties for not complying with this part?
              (a) If you fail to comply with the financial responsibility requirements of OPA at 33 U.S.C. 2716 or with the requirements of this part, then you may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $47,357 per COF per day of violation (that is, each day a COF is operated without acceptable evidence of OSFR).
              (b) BOEM will determine the date of a noncompliance. BOEM will assess penalties in accordance with an OSFR penalty schedule using the procedures found at 30 CFR part 550, subpart N. You may obtain a copy of the penalty schedule from BOEM at the address in § 553.45.
              (c) BOEM may assess a civil penalty against you that is greater or less than the amount in the penalty schedule after taking into account the factors in section 4303(a) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2716a).
              (d) If you fail to correct a deficiency in the OSFR evidence for a COF, then the Director may suspend operation of a COF in the OCS under 30 CFR 250.170 or seek judicial relief, including an order suspending the operation of any COF.

            Subpart G—Limit of Liability for Offshore Facilities
            
              Source:
              79 FR 73840, Dec. 12, 2014, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 553.700
              What is the scope of this subpart?

              This subpart sets forth the limit of liability for damages for offshore facilities under Title I of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA), as adjusted, under section 1004(d) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)). This subpart also sets forth the method for adjusting the limit of liability for damages for offshore facilities for inflation, by regulation, under section 1004(d) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)).
            
            
              § 553.701
              To which entities does this subpart apply?
              This subpart applies to you if you are a responsible party for an offshore facility, other than a deepwater port under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501-1524), but including an offshore pipeline, or an abandoned offshore facility, including any abandoned offshore pipeline, unless your liability is unlimited under OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2704(c)).
            
            
              
              § 553.702
              What limit of liability applies to my offshore facility?
              Except as provided in 33 U.S.C. 2704(c), the limit of liability under OPA for a responsible party for any offshore facility, including any offshore pipeline, is the total of all removal costs plus $137.6595 million for damages with respect to each incident.

              § 553.703
              What is the procedure for calculating the limit of liability adjustment for inflation?
              The procedure for calculating limit of liability adjustments for inflation is as follows:
              (a) Formula for calculating a cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U. BOEM calculates the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit of liability was established by statute, or last adjusted by regulation, whichever is later (i.e., the Previous Period), to the year in which the Annual CPI-U is most recently published (i.e., the Current Period), using the following formula: Percent change in the Annual CPI-U = [(Annual CPI-U for Current Period − Annual CPI-U for Previous Period) ÷ Annual CPI-U for Previous Period] × 100. This cumulative percent change value is rounded to one decimal place.
              (b) Significance threshold. (1) A cumulative increase in the Annual CPI-U equal to three percent or more constitutes a significant increase in the Consumer Price Index within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. 2704(d)(4).
              (2) Not later than every three years from the year the limit of liability was last adjusted for inflation, BOEM will evaluate whether the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since that year has reached a significance threshold of three percent or greater.

              (3) For any three-year period evaluated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in which the cumulative percent increase in the Annual CPI-U is less than three percent, if BOEM has not issued an inflation adjustment during that period, BOEM will publish a notice of no inflation adjustment to the offshore facility limit of liability for damages in the Federal Register.
              (4) Once the three-percent threshold is reached, BOEM will increase by final rule the offshore facility limit of liability for damages in § 553.702 by an amount equal to the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit was established by statute, or last adjusted by regulation, whichever is later. After this adjustment is made, BOEM will resume its process of conducting a review every three years.
              (5) Nothing in this section will prevent BOEM, in BOEM's sole discretion, from adjusting the offshore facility limit of liability for damages for inflation by regulation issued more frequently than every three years.
              (c) Formula for calculating inflation adjustments. BOEM calculates adjustments to the offshore facility limit of liability in 30 CFR 553.702 for inflation using the following formula:
              
              
                New limit of liability = Previous limit of liability + (Previous limit of liability × the decimal equivalent of the percent change in the Annual CPI-U calculated under paragraph (a) of this section), then rounded to the closest $100.
            
            
              § 553.704
              How will BOEM publish the offshore facility limit of liability adjustment?

              BOEM will publish the inflation-adjusted limit of liability, and any statutory amendments to that limit of liability in the Federal Register, as amendments to § 553.702. Updates to the limit of liability under this section are effective on the 90th day after publication in the Federal Register of the amendments to § 553.702, unless otherwise specified by statute (in the event of a statutory amendment to the limit of liability), or in the Federal Register rule amending § 553.702.

              The management of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) resources is to be conducted in accordance with the findings, purposes, and policy directions provided by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (OCSLA or the Act) (43 U.S.C. 1332, 1801, 1802), and other executive, legislative, judicial and departmental guidance. The Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) will consider available environmental information in making decisions affecting OCS resources.
            
            
              § 556.101
              Purpose.
              The purpose of the regulations in this part is to establish the procedures under which the Secretary will exercise the authority to administer a leasing program for oil and gas, and sulfur.

              (2) BOEM collects this information to determine if an applicant seeking to obtain a lease or right-of-use and easement (RUE) on the OCS is qualified to hold such a lease or RUE and to determine whether any such applicant can meet the monetary and non-monetary requirements associated with a lease or RUE. Responses to this information collection are either required to obtain or retain a benefit or are mandatory under OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1331-1356a). BOEM will protect proprietary information collected according to section 26 of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1352), and this section.
              (3) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) requires us to inform the public that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that no one is required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a current and valid OMB control number.

              (4) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, by mail at 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166 or by email to regulation1@boem.gov, or by phone at (703) 787-1025.
              (b) Proprietary information. (1) Any proprietary information maintained by BOEM will be subject to the requirements of 43 CFR part 2.
              (2) No proprietary information received by BOEM under 43 U.S.C. 1352(c) will be transmitted to any affected State unless the lessee, to whom such information applies, or the permittee and all persons, to whom such permittee has sold such information under promise of confidentiality, agree to such transmittal.
              (c) Proprietary information in response to a Call for Information and Nominations (Call).
              (1) A specific indication of interest in an area received in response to a Call issued by the Secretary is proprietary information.
              (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, BOEM may provide a summary of indications of interest in areas received in response to a Call for a proposed sale.

            Subpart B—Oil and Gas Five Year Leasing Program
            
              § 556.200
              What is the Five Year leasing program?
              Section 18(a) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)), requires the Secretary to prepare an oil and gas leasing program that consists of a five-year schedule of proposed lease sales to best meet national energy needs, showing the size, timing, and location of leasing activity as precisely as possible. BOEM prepares the five year schedule of proposed lease sales consistent with the principles set out in section 18(a)(1) and (2)(A)-(H) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)(1) and (2)(A)-(H)) to obtain a proper balance among the potential for environmental damage, the potential for the discovery of oil and gas, and the potential for adverse impact on the coastal zone, as required by OCSLA section 18(a)(3) (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)(3)).
            
            
              § 556.201
              Does BOEM consider multiple uses of the OCS?
              BOEM gathers information about multiple uses of the OCS in order to assist the Secretary in making decisions on the 5-year program pursuant to provisions of 43 U.S.C. 1344. For this purpose, BOEM invites and considers suggestions from States and local governments, industry, and any other interested parties, primarily through public notice and comment procedures. BOEM also invites and considers suggestions from Federal agencies.
            
            
              § 556.202
              How does BOEM start the Five Year program preparation process?
              To begin preparation of the Five Year program, BOEM invites and considers nominations for any areas to be included or excluded from leasing, by doing the following:
              (a) BOEM prepares and makes public official protraction diagrams and leasing maps of OCS areas. In any area properly included in the official Five Year diagrams and maps, any area not already leased for oil and gas may be offered for lease.

              (b) BOEM invites and considers suggestions and relevant information from governors of States, local governments, industry, Federal agencies, and other interested parties, through a publication of a request for information in the Federal Register. Any local government must first submit its comments on the request for information to its State governor before sending the comments to BOEM.
              (c) BOEM sends a letter to the governor of each affected State asking the governor to identify specific laws, goals, and policies that should be considered. Each State governor, as well as the Department of Commerce, is requested to identify the relationship between any oil and gas activity and the State under sections 305 and 306 of the CZMA, 16 U.S.C. 1454 and 1455.
              (d) BOEM asks the Department of Energy for information on regional and national energy markets and transportation networks.
            
            
              § 556.203
              What does BOEM do before publishing a proposed Five Year program?
              After considering the comments and information described in § 556.202, BOEM will prepare a draft proposed Five Year program.

              (a) At least 60 days before publication of a proposed program, BOEM will send a letter, together with the draft proposed program, to the governor of each affected State, inviting the governor to comment on the draft proposed program.
              (b) A governor, whether for purposes of preparing that State's comments or otherwise, may solicit comments from local governments that he determines may be affected by an oil and gas leasing program.

              (c) If a governor's comments on the draft proposed program are received by BOEM at least 15 days before submission of the proposed program to Congress and its publication for comment in the Federal Register, BOEM will reply to the governor in writing.
            
            
              § 556.204
              How do governments and citizens comment on a proposed Five Year program?
              BOEM publishes the proposed program in the Federal Register for comment by the public. At the same time, BOEM sends the proposed program to the governors of the affected States and to Congress and the Attorney General of the United States for review and comment.
              (a) Governors are responsible for providing a copy of the proposed program to affected local governments in their States. Local governments may comment directly to BOEM, but must also send their comments to the governor of their State.

              (b) All comments from any party are due within 90 days after publication of the request for comments in the Federal Register.
            
            
              § 556.205
              What does BOEM do before approving a proposed final Five Year program or a significant revision of a previously-approved Five Year program?
              At least 60 days before the Secretary may approve a proposed final Five Year program or a significant revision to a previously approved final Five Year program, BOEM will submit a proposed final program or proposed significant revision to the President and Congress. BOEM will also submit comments received and indicate the reasons why BOEM did or did not accept any specific recommendation of the Attorney General of the United States, the governor of a State, or the executive of a local government.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Planning and Holding a Lease Sale
            
              § 556.300
              What reports may BOEM and other Federal agencies prepare before a lease sale?
              For an oil and gas lease sale in a Five Year program, and as the need arises for other mineral leasing pursuant to part 581 of this chapter, BOEM will prepare a report describing the general geology and potential mineral resources of the area under consideration. The Director may request other interested Federal agencies to prepare reports describing, to the extent known, any other valuable resources contained within the general area and the potential effect of mineral operations upon the resources or upon the total environment or other uses of the area.
            
            
              § 556.301
              What is a Call for Information and Nominations?

              BOEM issues a Call for Information and Nominations (“Call”) on an area proposed for leasing in the Five Year program through publication in the Federal Register and other publications. A Call may include more than one proposed sale. Comments are requested from industry and the public on:
              (a) Industry interest in the area proposed for leasing, including nominations or indications of interest in specific blocks within the area;
              (b) Geological conditions, including bottom hazards;
              (c) Archaeological sites on the seabed or near shore;
              (d) Potential multiple uses of the proposed leasing area, including navigation, recreation, and fisheries;
              (e) Areas that should receive special concern and analysis; and
              (f) Other socioeconomic, biological, and environmental information.
            
            
              § 556.302
              What does BOEM do with the information from the Call?

              (a) Based upon information and nominations received in response to the Call, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, the Director will develop a recommendation of areas proposed for leasing for the Secretary for further consideration for leasing and/or environmental analysis.
              (1) In developing the recommendation, the Director will consider available information concerning the environment, conflicts with other uses, resource potential, industry interest, and other relevant information, including comments received from State and local governments and other interested parties in response to the Call.
              (2) The Director, on his/her own motion, may include in the recommendation areas in which interest has not been indicated in response to a Call. In making a recommendation, the Director will consider all available environmental information.

              (3) Upon approval by the Secretary, the Director will announce the area identified in the Federal Register.
              (b) BOEM will evaluate the area(s) identified for further consideration for the potential effects of leasing on the human, marine, and coastal environments, and may develop measures to mitigate adverse impacts, including lease stipulations, for the options to be analyzed. The Director may hold public hearings on the environmental analysis after an appropriate notice.
              (c) BOEM will seek to inform the public, as soon as possible, of changes from the area(s) proposed for leasing that occur after the Call process.
              (d) Upon request, the Director will provide relative indications of interest in areas, as well as any comments filed in response to a Call for a proposed sale. However, no information transmitted will identify any particular area with the name of any particular party so as not to compromise the competitive position of any participants in the process of indicating interest.
              (e) For supplemental sales provided for by § 556.308, the Director's recommendation will be replaced by a statement describing the results of the Director's consideration of the factors specified above in this section.

              (f) Any person who obtains a qualification number from BOEM is responsible to ensure that it is not using the qualification number approved by BOEM for any purpose that its operating rules do not allow.
              (g) Any evidence submitted in response to paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section is submitted subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001.
              (h) A person may not hold leases on the OCS until the evidence requested in this section has been accepted and approved by BOEM and BOEM has issued a qualification number to that person.
              (i) If use of a corporate seal is required by this section, you may meet the requirement as specified in § 556.107.
            
            
              § 556.403
              Under what circumstances may I be disqualified from acquiring a lease or an interest in a lease on the OCS?
              You may be disqualified from acquiring a lease or an interest in a lease on the OCS if:
              (a) You or your principals are excluded or disqualified from participating in a transaction covered by Federal non-procurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR parts 180 and 1400), unless the Department explicitly approves an exception for a transaction pursuant to the regulations in those parts;
              (b) The Secretary finds, after notice and hearing, that you or your principals (including in the meaning of “you,” for purposes of this subparagraph, a bidder or prospective bidder) fail to meet due diligence requirements or to exercise due diligence under section 8(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1337(d)) on any OCS lease; or
              (c) BOEM disqualifies you from acquiring a lease or an interest in a lease on the OCS based on your unacceptable operating performance. BOEM will give you adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing before imposing a disqualification, unless BSEE has already provided such notice and opportunity for a hearing.

              § 556.404
              What do the non-procurement debarment rules require that I do?
              You must comply with the Department's non-procurement debarment regulations at 2 CFR parts 180 and 1400.
              (a) You must notify BOEM if you know that you or your principals are excluded, disqualified, have been convicted or are indicted of a crime as described in 2 CFR part 180, subpart C. You must make this notification before you sign a lease, sublease, or an assignment of record title interest or operating rights interest, or become a lease or unit operator. This paragraph does not apply if you have previously provided a statement disclosing this information, and you have received an exception from the Department, as described in 2 CFR 180.135 and 2 CFR 1400.137.
              (b) If you wish to enter into a covered transaction with another person at a lower tier, as described in 2 CFR 180.200, you must first:
              (1) Verify that the person is not excluded or disqualified under 2 CFR part 180; and
              (2) Require the person to:
              (i) Comply with 2 CFR part 180, subpart C; and
              (ii) Include the obligation to comply with 2 CFR part 180, subpart C in its contracts and other transactions.
              (c) After you enter into a covered transaction, you must immediately notify BOEM in writing if you learn that:
              (1) You failed to disclose pertinent information earlier; or
              (2) Due to changed circumstances, you or your principals now meet any of the criteria in 2 CFR 180.800.
            
            
              
              § 556.405
              When must I notify BOEM of mergers, name changes, or changes of business form?
              You must notify BOEM of any merger, name change, or change of business form as soon as practicable, but in no case later than one year after the earlier of the effective date or the date of filing the change or action with the Secretary of State or other authorized official in the State of original registry.

              How To Bid
              
                § 556.500
                Once qualified, how do I submit a bid?
                (a) You must submit a separate sealed bid for each tract or bidding unit to the address provided and by the time specified in the final notice of sale. You may not bid on less than an entire tract or bidding unit.
                (b) BOEM requires a deposit for each bid. The final notice of sale will specify the amount and method of payment.
                (c) Unless otherwise specified in the final notice of sale, the bid deposit amount will be 20 percent of the amount of the bid for any given tract or bidding unit.
                (d) You may not submit a bid on an OCS tract if, after notice and hearing under section 8(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1337(d)), the Secretary finds that you are not meeting the diligence requirements on any OCS lease.
                (e) If the authorized officer within BOEM rejects your high bid, the decision is final for the Department, subject only to reconsideration upon your written request as set out in § 556.517.
              
              
                § 556.501
                What information do I need to submit with my bid?
                In accordance with OCSLA section 18(a)(4) (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)(4)), BOEM must evaluate every bid to ensure that the federal government receives fair market value for every lease. Section 26(a)(1)(A) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1352(a)(1)(A)) provides that, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any lessee or permittee conducting any exploration for, or development or production of, oil or gas must provide the Secretary access to all data and information (including processed, analyzed, and interpreted information) obtained from that activity and must provide copies of that data and information as the Secretary may request.
                (a) As part of the lease sale process, every bidder submitting a bid on a tract, or participating as a joint bidder in such a bid, may at the time of bid be required to submit various information, including a Geophysical Data and Information Statement (GDIS) corresponding to that tract, as well as the bidder's exclusive/proprietary geophysical data in order for BOEM to properly evaluate the bid. If a GDIS required, each GDIS must include, as required by § 551.12(b) and (c) of this chapter:
                (1) A list of geophysical surveys or other information used as part of the decision to bid or participate in a bid on the block.
                (2) An accurate and complete record of each geophysical survey conducted, including digital navigational data and final location maps. The bidder and any joint bidder must include a map for each survey identified in the GDIS that illustrates the actual areal extent of the proprietary geophysical data.
                (b) If a bidder is required to submit a GDIS, the GDIS must be submitted even if the bidder did not rely on proprietary geophysical data and information in deciding to bid or participate as a joint bidder in the bid for any particular block, and must include entries for all such blocks.
                (c) The bidder must submit each GDIS in a separate and sealed envelope, or in an electronically readable spreadsheet format, with proprietary seismic data maps also available in an electronic format. Each bidder must submit the GDIS even if its joint bidder or bidders on a specific block also have submitted a GDIS.
                (d) If BOEM requires additional information related to bidding, it will describe the additional information requirements in the final notice of sale.

                (e) BOEM will reimburse bidders for the costs of complying with the requirements of this section, in accordance with § 550.196 (on lease) and/or § 551.13 (off lease) of this chapter.
                
                (f) Bids that are not made in compliance with this section will be considered incomplete and invalid.
              
            
            
              Restrictions on Joint Bidding
              
                § 556.511
                Are there restrictions on bidding with others and do those restrictions affect my ability to bid?
                The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. 6213, prohibits joint bidding by major oil and gas producers under certain circumstances. BOEM implements 42 U.S.C. 6213 as follows:
                (a) BOEM publishes twice yearly in the Federal Register a restricted joint bidders list. A person appearing on this list is limited in its ability to submit a joint bid. The list:
                (1) Consists of the persons chargeable with an average worldwide daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil and/or its equivalent in natural gas liquids and natural gas for the prior production period; and
                (2) Is based upon the statement of production that filed as required by § 556.513.
                (b) If BOEM places you on the restricted joint bidders list, BOEM will send you a copy of the order placing you on the list. You may appeal this order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 590, subpart A.
                (c) If you are listed in the Federal Register in any group of restricted bidders, you may not bid:
                (1) Jointly with another person in any other group of restricted bidders for the applicable 6-month bidding period; or
                (2) Separately during the 6-month bidding period if you have an agreement with another restricted bidder that will result in joint ownership in an OCS lease.
                (d) If you are listed in the Federal Register in any group of restricted bidders, you may not make any pre-bidding agreement for the conveyance of any potential lease interest, whether by assignment, sale, transfer, or other means, to any person on the list of restricted joint bidders.
                (e) Even if you are not listed in the Federal Register in any group of restricted bidders, you are prohibited from making any pre-bidding agreement for the assignment, sale, transfer, or other conveyance of any potential lease interest to two or more persons in different groups on the list of restricted joint bidders.
                (f) As a bidder, you are prohibited from unlawful combination with, or intimidation of, bidders under 18 U.S.C. 1860.
              
              
                § 556.512
                What bids may be disqualified?
                The following bids for any oil and gas lease will be disqualified and rejected in their entirety:
                (a) A joint bid submitted by two or more persons who are on the effective List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or
                (b) A joint bid submitted by two or more persons when:
                (1) One or more of those persons is chargeable for the prior production period with an average daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and has not filed a Statement of Production, as required by § 556.513 of this part for the applicable 6-month bidding period, or
                (2) Any of those persons have failed or refused to file a detailed report of production when required to do so under § 556.513, or
                (c) A single or joint bid submitted pursuant to an agreement (whether written or oral, formal or informal, entered into or arranged prior to or simultaneously with the submission of such single or joint bid, or prior to or simultaneously with the award of the bid upon the tract) that provides:
                (1) For the assignment, transfer, sale, or other conveyance of less than a 100 percent interest in the entire tract on which the bid is submitted, by a person or persons on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, effective on the date of submission of the bid, to another person or persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or

                (2) For the assignment, sale, transfer or other conveyance of less than a 100 percent interest in any fractional interest in the entire tract (which fractional interest was originally acquired by the person making the assignment, sale, transfer or other conveyance, under the provisions of the act) by a person or persons on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, effective on the date of submission of the bid, to another person or persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or
                (3) For the assignment, sale, transfer, or other conveyance of any interest in a tract by a person or persons not on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, effective on the date of submission of the bid, to two or more persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders; or
                (4) For any of the types of conveyances described in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section where any party to the conveyance is chargeable for the prior production period with an average daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and has not filed a Statement of Production pursuant to § 556.513 for the applicable six-month bidding period. Assignments expressly required by law, regulation, lease or lease stipulation will not disqualify an otherwise qualified bid; or
                (d) A bid submitted by or in conjunction with a person who has filed a false, fraudulent or otherwise intentionally false or misleading detailed Report of Production.
              
              
                § 556.513
                When must I file a statement of production?
                (a) You must file a statement of production if your average worldwide daily production exceeded 1.6 million barrels for the prior production period, as determined using the method set forth in § 556.514. Your statement of production must specify that you were chargeable with an average daily production in excess of 1.6 million barrels for the prior production period.
                (b) The prior production periods are as follows:

                    July through December.
                  
                  
                    (2) November through April
                    January through June.
                  
                
                (c) You must file the statement of production by the following deadlines:

                (d) If you are required to file a statement of production, BOEM may require you to submit a detailed report of production.
                (1) The detailed report of production must list crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas produced worldwide from reservoirs during the prior production period, and therefore chargeable to the prior production period.
                (i) The amount of crude oil chargeable to the prior production period will be established by measurement of volumes delivered at the point of custody transfer (e.g., from storage tanks to pipelines, trucks, tankers, or other media for transport to refineries or terminals), with adjustments for net differences between opening and closing inventories, and basic sediment and water.
                (ii) The amount of natural gas liquids chargeable to the prior production period must include gas liquefied at surface separators, field facilities, or gas processing plants.
                (iii) The amount of natural gas chargeable to the prior production period must include adjustments, where applicable, to reflect the volume of gas returned to natural reservoirs, and the reduction of volume resulting from the removal of natural gas liquids and non-hydrocarbon gases.
                (2) You must submit the detailed report of production within 30 days after receiving BOEM's request.
                (3) BOEM may inspect and copy any document, record of production, analysis, and other material to verify the accuracy of any earlier statement of production.
                (e) If you submit a statement of production that misrepresents your chargeable production, the Department may cancel any lease awarded in reliance upon the statement.
              
              
                § 556.514
                How do I determine my production for purposes of the restricted joint bidders list?
                (a) To determine the amount of production chargeable to you, add together:

                (1) Your average daily production in barrels of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas worldwide, all measured at 60 °F, using the equivalency or conversion factors for natural gas liquids and natural gas set out in 42 U.S.C. 6213(b)(2) and (3); and
                (2) Your proportionate share of the average daily production owned by any person that has an interest in you and/or in which you have an interest.
                (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, your production includes 100 percent of production owned by:
                (1) You;
                (2) Every subsidiary of yours;
                (3) Every person of which you are a subsidiary; and
                (4) Every subsidiary of any person of which you are a subsidiary.
                (c) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, interest means at least a five percent ownership or control of you or the reporting person and includes any interest:
                (1) From ownership of securities or other evidence of ownership; or,
                (2) By participation in any contract, agreement, or understanding regarding control of the person or their production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, or natural gas.
                (d) For purposes of this section, subsidiary means a person, 50 percent or more of whose stock or other interest having power to vote for the election of a controlling body, such as directors or trustees, is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another person.
                (e) For purposes of this section, production chargeable to you includes, but is not limited to, production obtained as a result of a production payment or a working, net profit, royalty, overriding royalty, or carried interest.
                (f) For purposes of this section, production must be measured with appropriate adjustments for:
                (1) Basic sediment and water;
                (2) Removal of natural gas liquids and non-hydrocarbon gases; and
                (3) Volume of gas returned to natural reservoirs.
              
              
                § 556.515
                May a person be exempted from joint bidding restrictions?
                BOEM may exempt you from some or all of the reporting requirements listed in § 556.513, and/or some or all of the joint bidding restrictions listed in §§ 556.511 and/or 556.512(a), (b), and/or (c), if, after opportunity for a hearing, BOEM determines that the extremely high costs in an area will preclude exploration and development without an exemption.
              
            
            
              How Does BOEM Act on Bids?
              
                § 556.516
                What does BOEM do with my bid?
                (a) BOEM opens the sealed bids at the place, date, and hour specified in the final notice of sale for the sole purpose of publicly announcing and recording the bids. BOEM does not accept or reject any bids at that time.
                (b) BOEM reserves the right to reject any and all bids received, regardless of the amount offered. BOEM accepts or rejects all bids within 90 days of opening. BOEM reserves the right to extend that time if necessary, and in that event, BOEM will notify bidder(s) in writing prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day period, or of any extension. Any bid not accepted within the prescribed 90-day period, or any extension thereof, will be deemed rejected. If your bid is rejected, BOEM will refund any money deposited with your bid, plus any interest accrued.
                (c) If the highest bids are a tie, BOEM will notify the bidders who submitted the tie bids. Within 15 days after notification, those bidders, if qualified, and not otherwise prohibited from bidding together, may:
                (1) Agree to accept the lease jointly. The bidders must notify BOEM of their decision and submit a copy of their agreement to accept the lease jointly.
                (2) Agree between/among themselves which bidder will accept the lease. The bidders must notify BOEM of their decision.
                (d) If no agreement is submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, BOEM will reject all the tie bids.
                (e) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, has 30 days to review the results of the lease sale before BOEM may accept the bid(s) and issue the lease(s).
              
              
                § 556.517
                What may I do if my high bid is rejected?

                (a) The decision of the authorized officer on bids is the final action of the Department, subject only to reconsideration of the rejection of the high bid by the Director, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
                (b) Within 15 days of bid rejection, you may file a written request for reconsideration with the Director, with a copy to the authorized officer. Such request must provide evidence as to why the Director should reconsider your bid. You will receive a written response either affirming or reversing the rejection of your bid.
                (c) The Director's decision on the request for reconsideration is not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals in the Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

                (a) If BOEM accepts your bid, BOEM will provide you with the appropriate number of copies of the lease for you to execute and return to BOEM. Within 11 business days after you receive the lease copies, you must:
                (1) Execute all copies of the lease;
                (2) Pay the first year's rental;

                (5) Return all copies of the executed lease, including any required bond or other form of security approved by the Regional Director, to BOEM.
                (b) If provided for in the final notice of sale, BOEM may defer any part of the bonus and bid payment for up to five years after the sale according to a schedule included in the final notice of sale. You must provide a bond acceptable to BOEM to guarantee payment of a deferred bonus bid.
                (c) If you do not make the required payments and execute and return all copies of the lease and any required bond within 11 business days after receipt, or if you otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, your deposit will be forfeited. However, BOEM will return any deposit with interest if the tract is withdrawn from leasing before you execute the lease.
                (d) If you use an agent to execute the lease, you must include evidence with the executed copies of the lease that a person who is on the list of persons referenced in § 556.402(c)(3) authorized the agent to act for you.
                (e) After you comply with all requirements in this section, and after BOEM has executed the lease, BOEM will send you a fully executed lease.
              
              
                § 556.521
                When is my lease effective?
                Your lease is effective on the first day of the month following the date that BOEM executes the lease. You may request in writing, before BOEM executes the lease, that your lease be effective as of the first day of the month in which BOEM executes the lease. If BOEM agrees to make the lease effective as of the earlier date, BOEM will so indicate when it executes the lease.
              
              
                § 556.522
                What are the terms and conditions of the lease and when are they published?
                The terms and conditions of the lease will be stated in the final notice of sale and contained in the lease instrument itself. Oil and gas leases and leases for sulfur will be issued on forms approved by the Director.

                How may I maintain my oil and gas lease beyond the primary term?
                You may maintain your oil and gas lease beyond the expiration of the primary term as long as:
                (a) You are producing oil or gas in paying quantities;
                (b) You are conducting approved drilling or well reworking operations with the objective of establishing production in paying quantities, in accordance with 30 CFR 250.180;

                How may I maintain my sulfur lease beyond the primary term?
                You may maintain your sulfur lease after the primary term as long as you are producing sulfur in paying quantities, conducting drilling, well reworking or plant construction, or other operations for the production of sulfur or you are granted a suspension by BSEE; or your lease is subject to a suspension directed by BSEE for reasons other than gross negligence or a willful violation of a provision of your lease or governing regulations.
              
            
            
              Lease Obligations
              
                § 556.604
                What are my rights and obligations as a record title owner?
                (a) As a record title owner, you are responsible for all administrative and operating performance on the lease, including paying any rent and royalty due.
                (b)(1) A record title owner owns operating rights to the lease, unless and until he or she severs the operating rights by subleasing them to someone else.
                (2) A sublease of operating rights from record title may be for a whole or undivided fractional interest in the entire lease or a described aliquot portion of the lease and/or a depth interval. The sublease creates an operating rights interest in the sublessee, herein referred to as the operating rights owner.
                (c) Within any given aliquot, the record title owner may sublease operating rights for up to a maximum of two depth divisions, which may result in a maximum of three different depth intervals. But, if the one, or two, depth divisions to which operating rights are subleased do not include the entire depth of the lease, whatever depth division(s) has not been subleased, remains part of the lessee/sublessor's record title interest. The depth intervals for which operating rights are subleased must be defined by a beginning and ending depth and the ending of one depth level must abut the beginning of the next depth level, with no gap in between.

                (d) Every current and prior record title owner is jointly and severally liable, along with all other record title owners and all prior and current operating rights owners, for compliance with all non-monetary terms and conditions of the lease and all regulations issued under OCSLA, as well as for fulfilling all non-monetary obligations, including decommissioning obligations, which accrue while it holds record title interest.
                
                (e) Record title owners that acquired their record title interests through assignment from a prior record title owner are also responsible for remedying all existing environmental or operational problems on any lease in which they own record title interests, with subrogation rights against prior lessees.
                (f) For monetary obligations, your obligation depends on the source of the monetary obligation and whether you have retained or severed your operating rights.
                (1) With respect to those operating rights that you have retained, you are primarily liable under 30 U.S.C. 1712(a) for your pro-rata share of all other monetary obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to the operating rights you have retained, based on your share of operating rights in that portion of the lease.
                (2) With respect to all monetary obligations arising from or in connection with those operating rights that have been severed from your record title interest, your obligation is secondary to that of the sublessee(s) or later assignee(s) of the operating rights that were severed from your record title interest, as prescribed in 30 U.S.C. 1712(a).
              
              
                § 556.605
                What are my rights and obligations as an operating rights owner?
                (a) As an operating rights owner, you have the right to enter the leased area to explore for, develop, and produce oil and gas resources, except helium gas, contained within the aliquot(s) and depths within which you own operating rights, according to the lease terms, applicable regulations, and BOEM's approval of the sublease or subsequent assignment of the operating rights.
                (b) Unless otherwise prohibited, you have the right to authorize another party to conduct operations on the part of the lease to which your operating rights appertain.
                (c) An owner of operating rights who is designating a new designated operator must file a designation of operator under § 550.143 of this chapter.
                (d) An operating rights owner is only liable for obligations arising from that portion of the lease to which its operating rights appertain and that accrue during the period in which the operating rights owner owned the operating rights.
                (e) You are jointly and severally liable with other operating rights owners and the record title owners for all non-monetary lease obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to your operating rights, which accrued during the time you held your operating rights interest.
                (f) An operating rights owner that acquires its operating rights interests through assignment from a prior operating rights owner is also responsible, with subrogation rights against prior operating rights owners, for remedying existing environmental or operational problems, to the extent that such problems arise from that portion of the lease to which its operating rights appertain, on any lease in which it owns operating rights.
                (g) You are primarily liable for monetary obligations pertaining to that portion of the lease subject to your operating rights, and the record title owners are secondarily liable. If there is more than one operating rights owner in a lease, each operating rights owner is primarily liable for its pro-rata share of the monetary obligations that pertain to the portion of the lease that is subject to its operating rights.
              
            
            
              Helium
              
                § 556.606
                What must a lessee do if BOEM elects to extract helium from a lease?
                (a) BOEM reserves the ownership of, and the right to extract, helium from all gas produced from your OCS lease. Under section 12(f) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1341(f)), upon our request, you must deliver all or a specified portion of the gas containing helium to BOEM at a point on the leased area or at an onshore processing facility that BOEM designates.

                (b) BOEM will determine reasonable compensation and pay you for any loss caused by the extraction of helium, except for the value of the helium itself. BOEM may erect, maintain, and operate on your lease any reduction work and other equipment necessary for helium extraction. Our extraction of helium will be conducted in a manner to not cause substantial delays in the delivery of gas to your purchaser.
              
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Transferring All or Part of the Record Title Interest in a Lease
            
              § 556.700
              May I assign or sublease all or any part of the record title interest in my lease?
              (a) With BOEM approval, you may assign your whole, or a partial record title interest in your entire lease, or in any aliquot(s) thereof.
              (b) With BOEM approval, you may sever all, or a portion of, your operating rights.
              (c) You must request approval of each assignment of a record title interest and each sublease of an operating rights interest. Each instrument that transfers a record title interest must describe, by aliquot parts, the interest you propose to transfer. Each instrument that severs an operating rights interest must describe, by officially designated aliquot parts and depth levels, the interest proposed to be transferred.
            
            
              § 556.701
              How do I seek approval of an assignment of the record title interest in my lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest?

              (a) The Regional Director will provide the form to record an assignment of record title interest in a Federal OCS oil and gas or sulfur lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest. You must submit to BOEM two originals of each instrument that transfers ownership of record title within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. You must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your request and your submission must include evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
              (b) Before BOEM approves an assignment or transfer, it must consult with, and consider the views of, the Attorney General. The Secretary may act on an assignment or transfer if the Attorney General has not responded to a request for consultation within 30 days of said request.
              (c) A new record title owner or sublessee must file a designation of operator, in accordance with § 550.143 of this chapter, along with the request for the approval of the assignment.
            
            
              § 556.702
              When will my assignment result in a segregated lease?
              (a) When there is an assignment by all record title owners of 100 percent of the record title to one or more aliquots in a lease, the assigned and retained portions become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such case, both the new lease and the remaining portion of the original lease are referred to as “segregated leases” and the assignee(s) becomes the record title owner(s) of the new lease, which is subject to all the terms and conditions of the original lease.

              (b) If a record title holder transfers an undivided interest, i.e., less than 100 percent of the record title interest in any given aliquot(s), that transfer will not segregate the portions of the aliquots, or the whole aliquots, in which part of the record title was transferred, into separate leases from the portion(s) in which no interest was transferred. Instead, that transfer will create a joint ownership between the assignee(s) and assignor(s) in the portions of the lease in which part of the record title interest was transferred. Any transfer of an undivided interest is subject to approval by BOEM.
            
            
              § 556.703
              What is the effect of the approval of the assignment of 100 percent of the record title in a particular aliquot(s) of my lease and of the resulting lease segregation?
              (a) The bonding/financial assurance requirements of subpart I of this part apply separately to each segregated lease.
              (b) The royalty, minimum royalty, and rental provisions of the original lease will apply separately to each segregated lease.
              (c) BOEM will allocate among the segregated leases, on a basis that is equitable under the circumstances, any remaining unused royalty suspension volume or other form of royalty suspension or royalty relief that had been granted to the original lease, not to exceed in aggregate the total remaining amount.

              (d) Each segregated lease will continue in full force and effect for the primary term of the original lease and so long thereafter as each segregated lease meets the requirements outlined in § 556.601. A segregated lease that does not meet the requirements of § 556.601 does not continue in force even if another segregated lease, which was part of the original lease, continues to meet those requirements.
            
            
              § 556.704
              When would BOEM disapprove an assignment or sublease of an interest in my lease?
              (a) BOEM may disapprove an assignment or sublease of all or part of your lease interest(s):
              (1) When the transferor or transferee has unsatisfied obligations under this chapter or 30 CFR chapters II or XII;
              (2) When a transferor attempts a transfer that is not acceptable as to form or content (e.g., not on standard form, containing incorrect legal description, not executed by a person authorized to bind the corporation, transferee does not meet the requirements of § 556.401, etc.); or,
              (3) When the transfer does not conform to these regulations, or any other applicable laws or regulations (e.g., departmental debarment rules).
              (b) A transfer will be void if it is made pursuant to any prelease agreement that would cause a bid to be disqualified, such as those described in § 556.511(c), (d), or (e).
            
            
              § 556.705
              How do I transfer the interest of a deceased natural person who was a lessee?
              (a) An heir or devisee must submit evidence by means of a certified copy of an appropriate court order or decree that the person is deceased; or, if no court action is necessary, a certified copy of the will and death certificate or notarized affidavits of two disinterested parties with knowledge of the facts.
              (b) The heir or devisee, if the lawful successor in interest, must submit evidence that he/she is the person named in the will or evidence from an appropriate judgment of a court or decree that he/she is the lawful successor in interest, along with the required evidence of his/her qualifications to hold a lease under subpart D of this part.
              (c) If the heir or devisee does not qualify to hold a lease under subpart D of this part, he/she will be recognized as the successor in interest, but he/she must divest him/herself of this interest in the lease, to a person qualified to be a hold a lease, within two years.
            
            
              § 556.706
              What if I want to transfer record title interests in more than one lease at the same time, but to different parties?

              You may not transfer interests in more than one lease to different parties using the same instrument. If you want to transfer the interest in more than one lease at the same time, you must submit duplicate, originally executed forms for each transfer. The forms used for each transfer must be accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof) and evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
            
            
              § 556.707
              What if I want to transfer different types of lease interests (not only record title interests) in the same lease to different parties?

              You may not transfer different types of lease interests in a lease to different parties using the same instrument. You must submit duplicate, originally executed forms for each transfer, to a different party, of a different type of lease interest. The form used to transfer each type of lease interest must be accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof) and evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
            
            
              § 556.708
              What if I want to transfer my record title interests in more than one lease to the same party?

              You may not transfer your record title interests in more than one lease to the same party using the same instrument. If you want to transfer record title interests in more than one lease at the same time, you must submit separate, originally executed forms for each transfer. The forms used for each transfer must be accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof), and evidence of payment via pay.gov. A separate fee applies to each individual transfer of interest.
            
            
              
              § 556.709
              What if I want to transfer my record title interest in one lease to multiple parties?

              You may transfer your record title interest in one lease to multiple parties using the same instrument. That instrument must be submitted in duplicate originals, accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof). In such a multiple transfer of interests using a single instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of interest, and evidence of payment via pay.gov must accompany the instrument.
            
            
              § 556.710
              What is the effect of an assignment of a lease on an assignor's liability under the lease?
              If you assign your record title interest, as an assignor you remain liable for all obligations, monetary and non-monetary, that accrued in connection with your lease during the period in which you owned the record title interest, up to the date BOEM approves your assignment. BOEM's approval of the assignment does not relieve you of these accrued obligations. Even after assignment, BOEM or BSEE may require you to bring the lease into compliance if your assignee or any subsequent assignee fails to perform any obligation under the lease, to the extent the obligation accrued before approval of your assignment. Until there is a BOEM-approved assignment of interest, you, as the assignor, remain liable for the performance of all lease obligations that accrued while you held record title interest, until all such obligations are fulfilled.
            
            
              § 556.711
              What is the effect of a record title holder's sublease of operating rights on the record title holder's liability?
              (a) A record title holder who subleases operating rights remains liable for all obligations of the lease, including those obligations accruing after BOEM's approval of the sublease, subject to § 556.604(e) and (f).
              (b) Neither the sublease of operating rights, nor subsequent assignment of those rights by the original sublessee, nor by any subsequent assignee of the operating rights, alters in any manner the liability of the record title holder for nonmonetary obligations.
              (c) Upon approval of the sublease of the operating rights, the sublessee and subsequent assignees of the operating rights become primarily liable for monetary obligations, but the record title holder remains secondarily liable for them, as prescribed in 30 U.S.C. 1712(a) and § 556.604(f)(2).
            
            
              § 556.712
              What is the effective date of a transfer?
              Any transfer is effective at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month following the date on which BOEM approves your request, unless you request an earlier effective date and BOEM approves that earlier date, but such earlier effective date, if prior to the date of BOEM's approval, does not relieve you of obligations accrued between that earlier effective date and the date of approval.
            
            
              § 556.713
              What is the effect of an assignment of a lease on an assignee's liability under the lease?
              As assignee, you and any subsequent assignees are liable for all obligations that accrue after the effective date of your assignment. As assignee, you must comply with all the terms and conditions of the lease and regulations issued under OCSLA, and in addition, you must remedy all existing environmental and operational problems on the lease, properly abandon all wells, and reclaim the site, as required under 30 CFR part 250.
            
            
              § 556.714
              As a restricted joint bidder, may I transfer an interest to another restricted joint bidder?

              (a) Where the proposed assignment or transfer is by a person who, at the time of acquisition of an interest in the lease, was on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, and that assignment or transfer is of less than the entire interest held by the assignor or transferor and to a person or persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders, the assignor or transferor must file, prior to the approval of the assignment, a copy of all agreements applicable to the acquisition of that lease or fractional interest, or a description of the timing and nature of the agreement(s) by which the assignor or transferor acquired the interest it now wishes to transfer.
              (b) Such description of the timing and nature of the transfer agreement must be submitted together with a certified statement that attests to the truth and accuracy of any information reported concerning that agreement, subject to the penalties of 18 U.S.C. 1001.
              (c) If you wish to transfer less than your entire interest to another restricted joint bidder, BOEM may request the opinion of the Attorney General before acting on your request.
              (d) You may request that any submission to BOEM made pursuant to this part be treated confidentially. Please note such a request on your submission. BOEM will treat this request for confidentiality in accordance with the regulations at § 556.104 and the regulations at 43 CFR part 2.
            
            
              § 556.715
              Are there any interests I may transfer or record without BOEM approval?

              (a) You may create, transfer, or assign economic interests without BOEM approval. However, for record purposes, you must send BOEM a copy of each instrument creating or transferring such interests within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. For each lease affected, you must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your documents submitted for record purposes and your submission must include evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              

              (b) For recordkeeping purposes, you may also submit other legal documents to BOEM for transactions that do not require BOEM approval. If you submit such documents for record purposes not required by this part, you must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your document submissions for each lease affected. Your submission must include evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
            
            
              § 556.716
              What must I do with respect to the designation of operator on a lease when a transfer of record title is submitted?
              (a) If a transfer of ownership of the record title interest only changes the percentage ownership of the record title, no new parties or new aliquots are involved in the transaction, and no change of designated operator is made, you will not need to submit a new designation of operator form.
              (b) In all cases other than that in paragraph (a) of this section, you must submit new designation of operator forms in accordance with § 550.143 of this chapter. In the event that you are transferring multiple record title interests, you must comply with this requirement for each interest that does not fall within paragraph (a) of this section.
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Transferring All or Part of the Operating Rights in a Lease
            
              § 556.800
              As an operating rights owner, may I assign all or part of my operating rights interest?
              An operating rights owner may assign all or part of its operating rights interests, subject to BOEM approval. Each instrument that transfers an interest must describe, by officially designated aliquot parts and depth levels, the interest proposed to be transferred.
            
            
              § 556.801
              How do I seek approval of an assignment of my operating rights?

              (a) The Regional Director will provide the form to document the assignment of an operating rights interest. You must request approval of each assignment of operating rights and submit to BOEM two originals of each instrument that transfers ownership of operating rights within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. You must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your request and your submission must include evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
              (b) A new operating rights owner must file a designation of operator, in accordance with § 550.143, along with the request for the approval of the assignment.
              (c) If an operating rights owner assigns an undivided ownership interest in its operating rights, that assignment creates a joint ownership in the operating rights.
              (d) Before BOEM approves a sublease or re-assignment of operating rights, BOEM may consult with and consider the views of the Attorney General.
            
            
              
              § 556.802
              When would BOEM disapprove the assignment of all or part of my operating rights interest?
              BOEM may disapprove an assignment of all or part of your operating rights interest:
              (a) When the transferor or transferee has outstanding or unsatisfied obligations under this chapter or 30 CFR chapter II or XII;
              (b) When a transferor attempts a transfer that is not acceptable as to form or content (e.g., not on standard form, containing incorrect legal description, not executed in accordance with corporate governance, transferee does not meet the requirements of § 556.401, etc.); or
              (c) When the transfer does not conform to these regulations, or any other applicable laws or regulations (e.g., departmental debarment rules).
            
            
              § 556.803
              What if I want to assign operating rights interests in more than one lease at the same time, but to different parties?

              You may not assign operating rights interests in more than one lease to different parties using the same instrument. If you want to transfer operating rights interests in more than one lease at the same time, you must submit two originally executed forms for each transfer. Each request for a transfer of operating rights interest must be accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof) and evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
            
            
              § 556.804
              What if I want to assign my operating rights interest in a lease to multiple parties?

              You may assign your operating rights interest in one lease to multiple parties using the same instrument. That instrument must be submitted in duplicate originals, accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof). In such a multiple transfer of interests using a single instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of interest and evidence of payment via pay.gov must accompany the instrument.
            
            
              § 556.805
              What is the effect of an operating rights owner's assignment of operating rights on the assignor's liability?
              An operating rights owner (who does not hold record title) who assigns the operating rights remains liable for all obligations of the lease that accrued during the period in which the assignor owned the operating rights, up to the effective date of the assignment, including decommissioning obligations that accrued during that period. BOEM's approval of the assignment does not alter that liability. Even after assignment, BOEM or BSEE may require the assignor to bring the lease into compliance if the assignee or any subsequent assignee fails to perform any obligation under the lease, to the extent the obligation accrued before approval of the assignment.
            
            
              § 556.806
              What is the effective date of an assignment of operating rights?
              An assignment is effective at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month following the date on which BOEM approves your request, unless you request an earlier effective date and BOEM approves that earlier date. Such an earlier effective date, if prior to the date of BOEM's approval, does not relieve you of obligations accrued between that earlier effective date and the date of approval.
            
            
              § 556.807
              What is the effect of an assignment of operating rights on an assignee's liability?
              As assignee, you and any subsequent assignees are liable for all obligations that accrue after the effective date of your assignment. As assignee, you must comply with all the terms and conditions of the lease and regulations issued under OCSLA. In addition, you must remedy all existing environmental and operational problems on the lease, properly abandon all wells, and reclaim the site, as required under 30 CFR part 250.
            
            
              § 556.808
              As an operating rights owner, are there any interests I may assign without BOEM approval?

              (a) You may create, transfer, or assign economic interests without BOEM approval. However, for record purposes, you must send BOEM a copy of each instrument creating or transferring such interests within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. For each lease affected, you must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your documents submitted for record purposes, and your submission must include evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              

              (b) For record keeping purposes, you may also submit other legal documents to BOEM for transactions that do not require BOEM approval. If you submit such documents for record purposes that are not required by these regulations, for each lease affected, you must pay the service fee listed in § 556.106 with your document submissions, and your submission must include evidence of payment via pay.gov.
              
            
            
              § 556.809
              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 556.810
              What must I do with respect to the designation of operator on a lease when a transfer of operating rights ownership is submitted?
              (a) If a transfer of ownership of operating rights only changes the percentage ownership; no new parties, new aliquots, or new depths are involved in the transaction; and no change of designated operator is made, you will not need to submit a new designation of operator form.
              (b) In all cases other than that in paragraph (a) of this section, you must submit new designation of operator forms, in accordance with § 550.143 of this chapter. In the event that you are transferring multiple operating rights interests, you must comply with this requirement for each interest that does not fall within paragraph (a) of this section.
            
          
          
            Subpart I—Bonding or Other Financial Assurance
            
              § 556.900
              Bond requirements for an oil and gas or sulfur lease.
              This section establishes bond requirements for the lessee of an OCS oil and gas or sulfur lease.
              (a) Before BOEM will issue a new lease or approve the assignment of an existing lease to you as lessee, you or another record title owner for the lease must:
              (1) Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or
              (2) Maintain a $300,000 area-wide bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulfur leases in the area where the lease is located; or
              (3) Maintain a lease or area-wide bond in the amount required in § 556.901(a) or (b).
              (b) For the purpose of this section, there are three areas. The three areas are:
              (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast;
              (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
              (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.
              (c) The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security instrument) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 556.901(a) and (b) may be satisfied if your operator or an operating rights owner provides a lease bond in the required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease. Your operator or an operating rights owner may use an areawide bond under this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.
              (d) If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or alternative form of security maintained under this section, the surety's remaining liability under the bond or alternative form of security is reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.
              (e) If the value of your surety bond or alternative security is reduced because of a default or for any other reason, you must provide additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the Regional Director may direct.

              (f) You may pledge United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they replace.
              (1) If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the required amount.
              (2) If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds in the event that the Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease obligation.
              (g) You may pledge alternative types of security instruments instead of providing a bond if the Regional Director determines that the alternative security protects the interests of the United States to the same extent as the required bond.
              (1) If you pledge an alternative type of security under this paragraph, you must monitor the security's value. If its market value falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the required amount.
              (2) If you pledge an alternative type of security, you must include authority for the Regional Director to sell the security and use the proceeds when the Regional Director determines that you failed to satisfy any lease obligation.
              (h) If you fail to replace a deficient bond or to provide additional bond coverage upon demand, the Regional Director may:
              (1) Assess penalties under part 550, subpart N of this chapter;
              (2) Suspend production and other operations on your leases in accordance with 30 CFR 250.173; and
              (3) Initiate action to cancel your lease.
            
            
              § 556.901
              Additional bonds.
              (a) This paragraph explains what bonds you must provide before lease exploration activities commence.
              (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $200,000 bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by the earliest of:
              (A) The date you submit a proposed exploration plan (EP) for approval; or
              (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of a lease on which an EP has been approved.
              (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $200,000 lease exploration bond after you submit an EP, but before approval of drilling activities under the EP.
              (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph (a) by providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.
              (2) A $200,000 lease exploration bond pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section need not be submitted and maintained if the lessee either:
              (i) Furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $1 million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulfur leases held by the lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is situated; or
              (ii) Furnishes and maintains a bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (b) This paragraph explains what bonds you (the lessee) must provide before lease development and production activities commence.
              (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $500,000 bond that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by the earliest of:
              (A) The date you submit a proposed development and production plan (DPP) or development operations coordination document (DOCD) for approval; or
              (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of a lease on which a DPP or DOCD has been approved.

              (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $500,000 lease development bond after you submit a DPP or DOCD, but before he/she approves the installation of a platform or the commencement of drilling activities under the DPP or DOCD.
              
              (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph by providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.
              (2) You need not submit and maintain a $500,000 lease development bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section if you furnish and maintain an areawide bond in the sum of $3 million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulfur leases you hold on the OCS for the area in which the lease is located.
              (c) If you can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that you can satisfy your decommissioning obligations for less than the amount of lease bond coverage required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the authorized officer may accept a lease surety bond in an amount less than the prescribed amount, but not less than the amount of the cost for decommissioning.

              (d) The Regional Director may determine that additional security (i.e., security above the amounts prescribed in § 556.900(a) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) is necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations under your lease, the regulations in this chapter, and the regulations in 30 CFR chapters II and XII.
              (1) The Regional Director's determination will be based on his/her evaluation of your ability to carry out present and future financial obligations demonstrated by:
              (i) Financial capacity substantially in excess of existing and anticipated lease and other obligations, as evidenced by audited financial statements (including auditor's certificate, balance sheet, and profit and loss sheet);
              (ii) Projected financial strength significantly in excess of existing and future lease obligations based on the estimated value of your existing OCS lease production and proven reserves for future production;
              (iii) Business stability based on five years of continuous operation and production of oil and gas or sulfur in the OCS or in the onshore oil and gas industry;
              (iv) Reliability in meeting obligations based on:
              (A) Credit rating; or
              (B) Trade references, including names and addresses of other lessees, drilling contractors, and suppliers with whom you have dealt; and
              (v) Record of compliance with laws, regulations, and lease terms.
              (2) You may satisfy the Regional Director's demand for additional security by increasing the amount of your existing bond or by providing additional bond or bonds.
              (e) The Regional Director will determine the amount of additional bond required to guarantee compliance. The Regional Director will consider potential underpayment of royalty and cumulative decommissioning obligations.
              (f) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities either increase or decrease, the Regional Director may adjust the amount of additional bond required.
              (1) If the Regional Director proposes an adjustment, the Regional Director will:
              (i) Notify you and the surety of any proposed adjustment to the amount of bond required; and
              (ii) Give you an opportunity to submit written or oral comment on the adjustment.
              (2) If you request a reduction of the amount of additional bond required, you must submit evidence to the Regional Director demonstrating that the projected amount of royalties due the Government and the estimated costs of decommissioning are less than the required bond amount. If the Regional Director finds that the evidence you submit is convincing, the Regional Director may reduce the amount of additional bond required.
            
            
              § 556.902
              General requirements for bonds.
              (a) Any bond or other security that you, as lessee, operating rights owner or operator, provide under this part must:
              (1) Be payable upon demand to the Regional Director;
              (2) Guarantee compliance with all of your obligations under the lease, regulations in this chapter, and regulations under 30 CFR chapters II and XII; and

              (3) Guarantee compliance with the obligations of all lessees, operating rights owners and operators on the lease.
              (b) All bonds and pledges you furnish under this part must be on a form or in a form approved by the Director. Surety bonds must be issued by a surety that the Treasury certifies as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds and that is listed in the current Treasury Circular No. 570. You may obtain a copy of the current Treasury Circular No. 570 from the Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.
              (c) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When either party is a corporation, an authorized official for the party must sign the bond and attest to it by an imprint of the corporate seal.
              (d) Bonds must be non-cancellable, except as provided in § 556.906 of this part. Bonds must continue in full force and effect even though an event occurs that could diminish, terminate, or cancel a surety obligation under State surety law.
              (e) Lease bonds must be:
              (1) A surety bond;
              (2) Treasury securities as provided in § 556.900(f);
              (3) Another form of security approved by the Regional Director; or
              (4) A combination of these security methods.
              (f) You may submit a bond to the Regional Director executed on a form approved under paragraph (b) of this section that you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If you do, and if the document omits terms or conditions contained on the form approved by the Director, the bond you submit will be deemed to contain the omitted terms and conditions.
            
            
              § 556.903
              Lapse of bond.
              (a) If your surety becomes bankrupt, insolvent, or has its charter or license suspended or revoked, any bond coverage from that surety terminates immediately. In that event, you must promptly provide a new bond in the amount required under §§ 556.900 and 556.901 to the Regional Director and advise the Regional Director of the lapse in your previous bond.
              (b) You must notify the Regional Director of any action filed alleging that you, your surety, or your guarantor are insolvent or bankrupt. You must notify the Regional Director within 72 hours of learning of such an action. All bonds must require the surety to provide this information to you and directly to BOEM.
            
            
              § 556.904
              Lease-specific abandonment accounts.
              (a) The Regional Director may authorize you to establish a lease-specific abandonment account in a federally insured institution in lieu of the bond required under § 556.901(d). The account must provide that, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, funds may not be withdrawn without the written approval of the Regional Director.
              (1) Funds in a lease-specific abandonment account must be payable upon demand to BOEM and pledged to meet your decommissioning obligations.
              (2) You must fully fund the lease-specific abandonment account to cover all decommissioning costs as estimated by BOEM within the timeframe the Regional Director prescribes.
              (3) You must provide binding instructions under which the institution managing the account is to purchase Treasury securities pledged to BOEM under paragraph (d) of this section.
              (b) Any interest paid on funds in a lease-specific abandonment account will be treated as other funds in the account unless the Regional Director authorizes in writing the payment of interest to the party who deposits the funds.
              (c) The Regional Director may allow you to pledge Treasury securities that are made payable upon demand to the Regional Director to satisfy your obligation to make payments into a lease-specific abandonment account.

              (d) Before the amount of funds in a lease-specific abandonment account equals the maximum insurable amount as determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the institution managing the account must use the funds in the account to purchase Treasury securities pledged to BOEM under paragraph (c) of this section. The institution managing the lease specific-abandonment account will join with the Regional Director to establish a Federal Reserve Circular 154 account to hold these Treasury securities, unless the Regional Director authorizes the managing institution to retain the pledged Treasury securities in a separate trust account. You may obtain a copy of the current Treasury Circular No. 154 from the Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.
              (e) The Regional Director may require you to create an overriding royalty or production payment obligation for the benefit of a lease-specific account pledged for the decommissioning of a lease. The required obligation may be associated with oil and gas or sulfur production from a lease other than the lease bonded through the lease-specific abandonment account.
            
            
              § 556.905
              Using a third-party guarantee instead of a bond.
              (a) When the Regional Director may accept a third-party guarantee. The Regional Director may accept a third-party guarantee instead of an additional bond under § 556.901(d) if:
              (1) The guarantee meets the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section;
              (2) The guarantee includes the terms specified in paragraph (d) of this section;
              (3) The guarantor's total outstanding and proposed guarantees do not exceed 25 percent of its unencumbered net worth in the United States; and
              (4) The guarantor submits an indemnity agreement meeting the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (b) What to do if your guarantor becomes unqualified. If, during the life of your third-party guarantee, your guarantor no longer meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(3) and (c)(3) of this section, you must:
              (1) Notify the Regional Director immediately; and
              (2) Cease production until you comply with the bond coverage requirements of this subpart.
              (c) Criteria for acceptable guarantees. If you propose to furnish a third party's guarantee, that guarantee must ensure compliance with all lessees' lease obligations, the obligations of all operating rights owners, and the obligations of all operators on the lease. The Regional Director will base acceptance of your third-party guarantee on the following criteria:
              (1) The period of time that your third-party guarantor (guarantor) has been in continuous operation as a business entity where:
              (i) Continuous operation is the time that your guarantor conducts business immediately before you post the guarantee; and
              (ii) Continuous operation excludes periods of interruption in operations that are beyond your guarantor's control and that do not affect your guarantor's likelihood of remaining in business during exploration, development, production, and decommissioning.
              (2) Financial information available in the public record or submitted by your guarantor, on your guarantor's own initiative, in sufficient detail to show to the Regional Director's satisfaction that your guarantor is qualified based on:
              (i) Your guarantor's current rating for its most recent bond issuance by either Moody's Investor Service or Standard and Poor's Corporation;
              (ii) Your guarantor's net worth, taking into account liabilities under its guarantee of compliance with all the terms and conditions of your lease, the regulations in this chapter and 30 CFR chapters II and XII, and your guarantor's other guarantees;
              (iii) Your guarantor's ratio of current assets to current liabilities, taking into account liabilities under its guarantee of compliance with all the terms and conditions of your lease, the regulations in this chapter and 30 CFR chapters II and XII, and your guarantor's other guarantees; and
              (iv) Your guarantor's unencumbered fixed assets in the United States.

              (3) When the information required by paragraph (c) of this section is not publicly available, your guarantor may submit the information in the following table. Your guarantor must update the information annually within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year or by the date prescribed by the Regional Director.
              
              
                
                  The guarantor should submit
                  That
                
                
                  (i) Financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year,
                  Include a report by an independent certified public accountant containing the accountant's audit opinion or review opinion of the statements. The report must be prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles and contain no adverse opinion.
                
                
                  (ii) Financial statements for completed quarters in the current fiscal year, and
                  Your guarantor's financial officer certifies to be correct.
                
                
                  (iii) Additional information as requested by the Regional Director.
                  Your guarantor's financial officer certifies to be correct.
                
              
              (d) Provisions required in all third-party guarantees. Your third-party guarantee must contain each of the following provisions.
              (1) If you, your operator, or an operating rights owner fails to comply with any lease term or regulation, your guarantor must either:
              (i) Take corrective action; or,
              (ii) Be liable under the indemnity agreement to provide, within 7 calendar days, sufficient funds for the Regional Director to complete corrective action.
              (2) If your guarantor complies with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, this compliance will not reduce its liability.
              (3) If your guarantor wishes to terminate the period of liability under its guarantee, it must:
              (i) Notify you and the Regional Director at least 90 days before the proposed termination date;
              (ii) Obtain the Regional Director's approval for the termination of the period of liability for all or a specified portion of your guarantor's guarantee; and
              (iii) Remain liable for all work and workmanship performed during the period that your guarantor's guarantee is in effect.
              (4) You must provide a suitable replacement security instrument before the termination of the period of liability under your third-party guarantee.
              (e) Required criteria for indemnity agreements. If the Regional Director approves your third-party guarantee, the guarantor must submit an indemnity agreement.
              (1) The indemnity agreement must be executed by your guarantor and all persons and parties bound by the agreement.
              (2) The indemnity agreement must bind each person and party executing the agreement jointly and severally.
              (3) When a person or party bound by the indemnity agreement is a corporate entity, two corporate officers who are authorized to bind the corporation must sign the indemnity agreement.
              (4) Your guarantor and the other corporate entities bound by the indemnity agreement must provide the Regional Director copies of:
              (i) The authorization of the signatory corporate officials to bind their respective corporations;
              (ii) An affidavit certifying that the agreement is valid under all applicable laws; and
              (iii) Each corporation's corporate authorization to execute the indemnity agreement.
              (5) If your third-party guarantor or another party bound by the indemnity agreement is a partnership, joint venture, or syndicate, the indemnity agreement must:
              (i) Bind each partner or party who has a beneficial interest in your guarantor; and
              (ii) Provide that, upon demand by the Regional Director under your third-party guarantee, each partner is jointly and severally liable for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease.
              (6) When forfeiture is called for under § 556.907, the indemnity agreement must provide that your guarantor will either:
              (i) Bring your lease into compliance; or
              (ii) Provide, within 7 calendar days, sufficient funds to permit the Regional Director to complete corrective action.

              (7) The indemnity agreement must contain a confession of judgment. It must provide that, if the Regional Director determines that you, your operator, or an operating rights owner is in default of the lease, the guarantor:
              
              (i) Will not challenge the determination; and
              (ii) Will remedy the default.
              (8) Each indemnity agreement is deemed to contain all terms and conditions contained in this paragraph (e), even if the guarantor has omitted them.
            
            
              § 556.906
              Termination of the period of liability and cancellation of a bond.
              This section defines the terms and conditions under which BOEM will terminate the period of liability of a bond or cancel a bond. Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during which obligations continue to accrue, but does not relieve the surety of the responsibility for obligations that accrued during the period of liability. Canceling a bond relieves the surety of all liability. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include obligations that started to accrue prior to the beginning of the period of liability and had not been met, and obligations that begin accruing during the period of liability.
              (a) When you or the surety under your bond requests termination:
              (1) The Regional Director will terminate the period of liability under your bond within 90 days after BOEM receives the request; and
              (2) If you intend to continue operations, or have not met all decommissioning obligations, you must provide a replacement bond of an equivalent amount.
              (b) If you provide a replacement bond, the Regional Director will cancel your previous bond and the surety that provided your previous bond will not retain any liability, provided that:
              (1) The new bond is equal to or greater than the bond that was terminated, or you provide an alternative form of security, and the Regional Director determines that the alternative form of security provides a level of security equal to or greater than that provided for by the bond that was terminated;
              (2) For a base bond submitted under § 556.900(a) or under § 556.901(a) or (b), the surety issuing the new bond agrees to assume all outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and
              (3) For additional bonds submitted under § 556.901(d), the surety issuing the new additional bond agrees to assume that portion of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated and that the Regional Director determines may exceed the coverage of the base bond, and of which the Regional Director notifies the provider of the bond.
              (c) This paragraph applies if the period of liability is terminated for a bond, but the bond is not replaced by a bond of an equivalent amount. The surety that provided your terminated bond will continue to be responsible for accrued obligations:
              (1) Until the obligations are satisfied; and
              (2) For additional periods of time in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) When your lease expires or is terminated, the surety that issued a bond will continue to be responsible, and the Regional Director will retain other forms of security as shown in the following table:
              
                
                  For the following type of bond
                  The period of liability will end
                  Your bond will be cancelled
                
                
                  (1) Base bonds submitted under § 556.900(a), § 556.901(a), or (b)
                  When the Regional Director determines that you have met all of your obligations under the lease,
                  Seven years after the termination of the lease, 6 years after completion of all bonded obligations, or at the conclusion of any appeals or litigation related to your bonded obligation, whichever is the latest. The Regional Director will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your security if the Regional Director determines that you need less than the full amount of the base bond to meet any possible future problems.
                
                
                  (2) Additional bonds submitted under § 556.901(d)
                  When the Regional Director determines that you have met all your obligations covered by the additional bond,
                  When you meet your bonded obligations, unless the Regional Director: (i) Determines that the future potential liability resulting from any undetected problem is greater than the amount of the base bond; and(ii) Notifies the provider of the bond that the Regional Director will wait 7 years before cancelling all or a part of the bond (or longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bonding obligation).
                  
                
              
              
              (e) For all bonds, the Regional Director may reinstate your bond as if no cancellation or release had occurred if:
              (1) A person makes a payment under the lease and the payment is rescinded or must be repaid by the recipient because the person making the payment is insolvent, bankrupt, subject to reorganization, or placed in receivership; or
              (2) The responsible party represents to BOEM that it has discharged its obligations under the lease, and the representation was materially false when the bond was canceled or released.
            
            
              § 556.907
              Forfeiture of bonds and/or other securities.
              This section explains how a bond or other security may be forfeited.
              (a) The Regional Director will call for forfeiture of all or part of the bond, other form of security, or guarantee you provide under this part if:
              (1) You (the party who provided the bond) refuse, or the Regional Director determines that you are unable to comply with any term or condition of your lease; or
              (2) You default on one of the conditions under which the Regional Director accepts your bond, third-party guarantee, and/or other form of security.
              (b) The Regional Director may pursue forfeiture of your bond without first making demands for performance against any lessee, operating rights owner, or other person authorized to perform lease obligations.
              (c) The Regional Director will:
              (1) Notify you, the surety on your bond or other form of security, and any third-party guarantor of a determination to call for forfeiture of the bond, security, or guarantee under this section.
              (i) This notice will be in writing, and will provide the reason for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited.
              (ii) The Regional Director must base the amount he/she determines is forfeited upon his/her estimate of the total cost of corrective action to bring your lease into compliance.
              (2) Advise you, your third-party guarantor, and any surety that you, your guarantor, and any surety may avoid forfeiture if, within five working days:
              (i) You agree to, and demonstrate that you will bring your lease into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director prescribes;
              (ii) Your third-party guarantor agrees to and demonstrates that it will complete the corrective action to bring your lease into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director prescribes; or
              (iii) Your surety agrees to and demonstrates that it will bring your lease into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director prescribes, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the face amount of the bond or other surety instrument.
              (d) If the Regional Director finds you are in default, he/she may cause the forfeiture of any bonds and other security deposited as your guarantee of compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter and 30 CFR chapters II and XII.
              (e) If the Regional Director determines that your bond and/or other security is forfeited, the Regional Director will:
              (1) Collect the forfeited amount; and
              (2) Use the funds collected to bring your leases into compliance and to correct any default.
              (f) If the amount the Regional Director collects under your bond and other security is insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective actions he/she may:
              (1) Take or direct action to obtain full compliance with your lease and the regulations in this chapter; and
              (2) Recover from you, any co-lessee, operating rights owner, and/or any third-party guarantor responsible under this subpart all costs in excess of the amount he/she collects under your forfeited bond and other security.
              (g) The amount that the Regional Director collects under your forfeited bond and other security may exceed the costs of taking the corrective actions required to obtain full compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter and 30 CFR chapters II and XII. In this case, the Regional Director will return the excess funds to the party from whom they were collected.
            
          
          
            
            Subpart J—Bonus or Royalty Credits for Exchange of Certain Leases
            
              § 556.1000
              Leases formerly eligible for a bonus or royalty credit.
              Bonus or royalty credits were available to lessees with leases:
              (a) In effect on December 20, 2006, and located in:
              (1) The Eastern Planning Area and within 125 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida; or,
              (2) The Central Planning Area and within the Desoto Canyon OPD, the Destin Dome OPD, or the Pensacola OPD and within 100 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida.
              (b) The deadline for applying for such a bonus or royalty credit was October 14, 2010; therefore, lessees may no longer apply for such credits.
            
          
          
            Subpart K—Ending a Lease
            
              § 556.1100
              How does a lease expire?
              (a) Your oil and gas lease will automatically expire at the end of its primary term unless you have taken action, as set forth in § 556.601, to maintain the lease beyond the primary term.
              (b) Your sulfur lease will automatically expire at the end of its primary term unless you have taken action, as set forth in § 556.603, to maintain the lease beyond the primary term.
            
            
              § 556.1101
              May I relinquish my lease or an aliquot part thereof?
              (a) A record title owner may relinquish a lease or an aliquot part of a lease if all record title owners of a lease or any aliquot part(s) of the lease file three original copies of a request to relinquish with BOEM on Form BOEM-0152, entitled, “Relinquishment of Federal Oil and Gas Lease.” No filing fee is required.
              (b) A relinquishment will be subject to the continued obligation of the record title owner and the surety to make all payments due, including any accrued rentals, royalties and deferred bonuses, and to abandon all wells and condition or remove all platforms and other facilities on the land to be relinquished to the satisfaction of the Director.
              (c) The effective date of the relinquishment is the date on which the relinquishment is filed with the proper BOEM regional office.
            
            
              § 556.1102
              Under what circumstances will BOEM cancel my lease?
              (a) BOEM may cancel your non-producing lease if you fail to comply with any provision of OCSLA, the lease, or applicable regulations if the failure continues for 30 days after mailing of notice to your post office address of record by registered mail and you have not requested and been granted any additional time within which to correct the failure. Such cancellation is subject to judicial review under section 23 of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1349).
              (b) Your producing lease may be cancelled if you fail to comply with any provision of OCSLA, the lease, or applicable regulations. The Secretary will cancel a producing lease after the judicial proceedings required under section 5(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(d)).
              (c) BOEM may cancel your lease if it determines that the lease was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. You will have notice and an opportunity to be heard before BOEM cancels your lease.
              (d) BOEM may cancel your lease at any time if it determines, after a hearing, that continued activity will probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral, national security or defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment; that the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable level within a reasonable period of time; and the advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing the lease.
              (e) BOEM may cancel your lease at any time after operations under the lease have been suspended or temporarily prohibited by the Department continuously for a period of five years pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, absent your request for a shorter period.

              (f) If, upon demand, you fail to provide a bond, or alternative type of security instrument acceptable to BOEM, the Regional Director may assess penalties or cancel your lease in accordance with part 550, subpart N of this chapter;
              (g) Title 30, part 550, subpart A of the CFR provides the procedures for lease cancellation and compensation, if applicable.
            
          
          
            Subpart L—Leases Maintained Under Section 6 of OCSLA
            
              § 556.1200
              Effect of regulations on lease.
              (a) All regulations in this part, insofar as they are applicable, will supersede the provisions of any lease that is maintained under section 6(a) of the Act. However, the provisions of a lease relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties (subject to sections 6(a)(8) and (9) of the Act), and term (subject to section 6(a)(10) of the Act and, as to sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) will continue in effect, and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, will take precedence over these regulations.
              (b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act is also subject to all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the OCS. In addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological exploratory operations and to pipeline ROW(s) are applicable, to the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent with the lease provisions relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties and term. The lessee must comply with any provision of the lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the regulations in this part.
            
            
              § 556.1201
              Section 6(a) leases and leases other than those for oil, gas, or sulfur.
              The existence of an oil and gas lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act precludes only the issuance in the same area of an oil and gas lease under OCSLA, but does not preclude the issuance of other types of leases under OCSLA. However, no other lease may authorize or permit the lessee thereunder unreasonably to interfere with or endanger operations under the existing lease. The United States will not grant any sulfur leases on any area that is included in a lease covering sulfur under section 6(b) of the Act.
            
          
          
            Subpart M—Environmental Studies
            
              § 556.1300
              Environmental studies.
              (a) The Director will conduct a study or studies of any area or region included in any oil and gas lease sale or other lease in order to establish information needed for assessment and management of impacts on the human, marine and coastal environments which may be affected by OCS oil and gas or other mineral activities in such area or region. The purposes of such studies will include, to the extent practicable, analyses of the impacts of pollutants introduced into the environments and impacts of offshore activities on the seabed and affected coastal areas.
              (b) Studies will be planned and carried out in cooperation with the affected States and interested parties and, to the extent possible, will not duplicate studies done under other laws. Where appropriate, the Director will, to the maximum extent practicable, coordinate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in executing its environmental studies responsibilities. The Director may also make agreements for the coordination with, or the use of the services or resources of, any other Federal, State or local government agency in the conduct of such studies.
              (c) Any study of an area or region required by paragraph (a) of this section for a lease sale will be commenced not later than six months prior to holding a lease sale for that area. The Director may use information collected in any prior study. The Director may initiate studies for an area or region not identified in the leasing program.

              (d) After the leasing and developing of any area or region, the Director will conduct such studies as are deemed necessary to establish additional information and will monitor the human, marine and coastal environments of such area or region in a manner designed to provide information, which can be compared with the results of studies conducted prior to OCS oil and gas development. This will be done to identify any significant changes in the quality and productivity of such environments, to establish trends in the area studies, and to design experiments identifying the causes of such changes. Findings from such studies will be used to recommend modifications in practices that are employed to mitigate the effects of OCS activities and to enhance the data/information base for predicting impacts which might result from a single lease sale or cumulative OCS activities.
              (e) Information available or collected by the studies program will, to the extent practicable, be provided in a form and in a timeframe that can be used in the decision-making process associated with a specific leasing action or with longer term OCS minerals management responsibilities.

                    Except for periods of royalty suspension, you will pay a fixed royalty rate of not less than 12.5 percent. If we award to you a lease under this system, you must calculate the royalty due during the designated period using the rate, formula, or schedule specified in the lease. We will specify the royalty rate, formula, or schedule in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.

                § 560.203
                What conditions apply to the bidding systems that BOEM uses?

                (a) For each of the bidding systems in § 560.110, we will include an annual rental fee. Other fees and provisions may apply as well. The Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register will specify the annual rental and any other fees the highest responsible qualified bidder must pay and any other provisions.

                (b) If we use any deferment or schedule of payments for the cash bonus bid, we will specify and include it in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.
                

                (c) For the bidding systems listed in this subpart, if the bid variable is a cash bonus bid, the highest bid by a qualified bidder determines the amount of cash bonus to be paid. We will include the minimum bid level(s) in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.
                

                (d) For the bidding systems listed in this subpart, if the bid variable is the royalty rate, the highest bid by a qualified bidder determines the royalty rate to be paid. We will include the minimum royalty rate(s) in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.
                

                (e) We may, by rule, add to or modify the bidding systems listed in § 560.110, according to the procedural requirements of the OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., as amended by Public Law 95-372, 92 Stat. 629.

                How do royalty suspension volumes apply to eligible leases?
                Royalty suspension volumes, as specified in section 304 of the Act, apply to eligible leases that meet the criteria in § 560.113. For purposes of this section and §§ 560.113 through 560.117:
                (a) Any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations (e.g., fuel gas) do not count against royalty suspension volumes; and
                (b) Production includes volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement.

                We may issue leases with suspension of royalties for a period, volume or value of production, as authorized in section 303 of the Act. For purposes of this section and §§ 560.121 through 560.124:
                (a) Any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations (e.g., fuel gas) do not count against royalty suspension volumes; and

                § 560.221
                When does a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000 get a royalty suspension?

                (a) We will specify any royalty suspension for your RS lease in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register for the sale in which you acquire the RS lease and will repeat it in the lease document. In addition:
                (1) Your RS lease may produce royalty-free the royalty suspension we specify for your lease, even if the field to which we assign it is producing.
                (2) The royalty suspension we specify in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale for your lease does not apply to any other leases in the field to which we assign your RS lease.
                (b) You may apply for a supplemental royalty suspension for a project under 30 CFR part 203, if your lease is located:
                (1) In the Gulf of Mexico, in water 200 meters or deeper, and wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or
                (2) Offshore of Alaska.
                (c) Your RS lease retains the royalty suspension with which we issued it even if we deny your application for more relief.

                How long will a royalty suspension volume be effective for a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?
                (a) The royalty suspension volume for your RS lease will continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production from your lease reaches the applicable royalty suspension volume or the lease period ends.
                (b)(1) Notwithstanding any royalty suspension volume under this subpart, you must pay royalty at the lease stipulated rate on:
                (i) Any oil produced for any period stipulated in the lease during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for light sweet crude oil exceeds the applicable threshold price of $36.39 per barrel, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
                (ii) Any natural gas produced for any period stipulated in the lease during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing price on the NYMEX for natural gas exceeds the applicable threshold price of $4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
                (iii) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar year.

                (2) You must pay any royalty due under this paragraph, plus late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54, no later than 90 days after the end of the period for which royalty is owed.
                (3) Any production on which you must pay royalty under this paragraph will count toward the production volume determined under §§ 560.120 through 560.124.
                (c) If you must pay royalty on any product (either oil or natural gas) for any period under paragraph (b) of this section, you must continue to pay royalty on that product during the next succeeding period of the same length until the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX prices for that product for that period can be determined. If the arithmetic average of the daily closing prices for that product for that period is less than the threshold price stipulated in the lease, you are entitled to a credit or refund of royalties paid for that period with interest under applicable law.

                You must measure natural gas production subject to the royalty suspension volume for your lease as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured according to 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.

                How will royalty suspension apply if BOEM assigns a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000 to a field that has a pre-Act lease?
                (a) We will assign your lease that has a qualifying well (under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A) to an existing field or designate a new field and will notify you and other affected lessees and operating rights holders in the field of that assignment.
                (1) Within 15 days of the final notification, you or any of the other affected lessees or operating rights holders may file a written request with the Director for reconsideration, accompanied by a Statement of Reasons.
                (2) The Director will respond in writing either affirming or reversing the assignment decision. The Director's decision is the final action of the Department of the Interior and is not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 590 and 43 CFR part 4.
                (b) If we establish a royalty suspension volume for a field as a result of an approved application for royalty relief submitted for a pre-Act lease under 30 CFR part 203, then:
                (1) Royalty-free production from your RS lease shares from and counts as part of any royalty suspension volume under § 560.114(d) for the field to which we assign your lease; and
                (2) Your RS lease may continue to produce royalty-free up to the royalty suspension we specified for your lease, even if the field to which we assign your RS lease has produced all of its royalty suspension volume.
                (c) Your lease may share in a suspension volume larger than the royalty suspension with which we issued it and to the extent we grant a larger volume in response to an application by a pre-Act lease submitted under 30 CFR part 203. To share in any larger royalty suspension volume, you must file an application described in 30 CFR part 203 (§§ 203.71 and 203.83). In no case will royalty-free production for your RS lease be less than the royalty suspension specified for your lease.

            § 570.5
            Complaint.

            (a) Whenever any person believes that he or she has been denied a contract or subcontract to which this part applies on the grounds of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex, such person may complain of such denial or withholding to the Regional Director of the OCS Region in which such action is alleged to have occurred. Any complaint filed under this part must be submitted in writing to the appropriate Regional Director not later than 180 days after the date of the alleged unlawful denial of a contract or subcontract which is the basis of the complaint.
            
            (b) The complaint referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accompanied by such evidence as may be available to a person and which is relevant to the complaint including affidavits and other documents.
            (c) Whenever any person files a complaint under this part, the Regional Director with whom such complaint is filed shall give written notice of such filing to all persons cited in the complaint no later than 10 days after receipt of such complaint. Such notice shall include a statement describing the alleged incident of discrimination, including the date and the names of persons involved in it.
          
          
            § 570.6
            Process.

                When do I notify BOEM that geophysical data and information are available for submission, inspection, and selection?
                (a) You must notify the Regional Director in writing when you complete the initial processing and interpretation of any geophysical data and information. Initial processing is the stage of processing where the data and information become available for in-house interpretation by the permittee, or become available commercially to third parties via sale, trade, license agreement, or other means.
                (b) The Regional Director may ask whether you have further processed or interpreted any geophysical data and information. When asked, you must respond to us in writing within 30 days.
                (c) The Regional Director may request that the permittee or third party submit geophysical data and information before making a final selection for retention. Our representatives may inspect and select the data and information on your premises, or the Regional Director can request delivery of the data and information to the appropriate regional office for review.
                (d) You must submit the geophysical data and information within 30 days of receiving the request, unless the Regional Director extends the delivery time.
                (e) At any time before final selection, the Regional Director may review and return any or all geophysical data and information. We will notify you in writing of any data the RD decides to retain.
              
              
                § 580.51
                What types of geophysical data and information must I submit to BOEM?
                Unless the Regional Director specifies otherwise, you must include:
                (a) An accurate and complete record of each geophysical survey conducted under the permit, including digital navigational data and final location maps;
                (b) All seismic data collected under a permit presented in a format and of a quality suitable for processing;
                (c) Processed geophysical information derived from seismic data with extraneous signals and interference removed, presented in a quality format suitable for interpretive evaluation, reflecting state-of-the-art processing techniques; and
                (d) Other geophysical data, processed geophysical information, and interpreted geophysical information including, but not limited to, shallow and deep subbottom profiles, bathymetry, sidescan sonar, gravity and magnetic surveys, and special studies such as refraction and velocity surveys.
              
              
                § 580.52
                When geophysical data and information are obtained by a third party, what must we both do?
                A third party may obtain geophysical data, processed geophysical information, or interpreted geophysical information from a permittee, or from another third party, by sale, trade, license agreement, or other means. If this happens:
                (a) The third-party recipient of the data and information assumes the obligations under this part, except for the notification provisions of § 580.50(a) and is subject to the penalty provisions of § 580.32(a)(1) and 30 CFR 550, subpart N; and
                (b) A permittee or third party that sells, trades, licenses, or otherwise provides data and information to a third party must advise the recipient, in writing, that accepting these obligations is a condition precedent of the sale, trade, license, or other agreement; and

                (c) Except for license agreements, a permittee or third party that sells, trades, or otherwise provides data and information to a third party must advise the Regional Director, in writing within 30 days of the sale, trade, or other agreements, including the identity of the recipient of the data and information; or
                (d) For license agreements, a permittee or third party that licenses data and information to a third party must, within 30 days of a request by the Regional Director, advise the Regional Director, in writing, of the license agreement, including the identity of the recipient of the data and information.
              
            
            
              Reimbursement
              
                § 580.60
                Which of my costs will be reimbursed?
                (a) We will reimburse you or a third party for reasonable costs of reproducing data and information that the Regional Director requests if:
                (1) You deliver G&G data and information to us for the Regional Director to inspect or select and retain (according to §§ 580.40 and 580.50);
                (2) We receive your request for reimbursement and the Regional Director determines that the requested reimbursement is proper; and
                (3) The cost is at your lowest rate (or a third party's) or at the lowest commercial rate established in the area, whichever is less.
                (b) We will reimburse you or the third party for the reasonable costs of processing geophysical information (which does not include cost of data acquisition) if, at the request of the Regional Director, you processed the geophysical data or information in a form or manner other than that used in the normal conduct of business.
              
              
                § 580.61
                Which of my costs will not be reimbursed?
                (a) When you request reimbursement, you must identify reproduction and processing costs separately from acquisition costs.
                (b) We will not reimburse you or a third party for data acquisition costs or for the costs of analyzing or processing geological information or interpreting geological or geophysical information.

                (a) The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
                (b) The implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2;
                (c) The Act; and
                (d) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550 and 552.
                (1) If the RD determines that any data or information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, we will not disclose the data and information unless either:
                (i) You and all third parties agree to the disclosure; or
                (ii) A provision of 30 CFR parts 550 and 552 allows us to make the disclosure.
                (2) We will keep confidential the identity of third-party recipients of data and information collected under a permit. We will not release the identity unless you and the third parties agree to the disclosure.

              The information collection requirements contained in part 581 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1010-0082. The information is being collected to determine if the applicant for a lease on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) is qualified to hold such a lease or to determine if a requested action is warranted. The information will be used to make those determinations. An applicant must respond to obtain or retain a benefit.
            
            
              § 581.1
              Purpose and applicability.
              The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures under which the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) will exercise the authority granted to administer a leasing program for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS. The rules in this part apply exclusively to leasing activities for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS pursuant to the Act.
            
            
              § 581.2

              Request for OCS mineral information and interest.

              (a) When considering whether to offer OCS minerals for lease, the Secretary, upon the Department of the Interior's own initiative or as a result of a submission under § 581.11, may request indications of interest in the leasing of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS minerals in the area being considered for lease. Requests for information and interest shall be published in the Federal Register and may be published elsewhere.
              (b) States and local governments, industry, other Federal Agencies, and all interested parties (including the public) may respond to a request for information and interest. All information provided to the Secretary will be considered in the decision whether to proceed with additional steps leading to the offering of OCS minerals for lease.

              (c) The Secretary may request specific information concerning the offering of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS minerals in a broad area for lease or the offering of one or more discrete tracts which represent a minable orebody. The Secretary's request may ask for comments on OCS areas which have been determined to warrant special consideration and analysis. Requests may be for comments concerning geological conditions or archaeological resources on the seabed; multiple uses of the area proposed for leasing, including navigation, recreation and fisheries; and other socioeconomic, biological, and environmental information relating to the area proposed for leasing.
            
            
              § 581.13
              Joint State/Federal coordination.
              (a) The Secretary may invite the adjacent State Governor(s) to join in, or the adjacent State Governor(s) may request that the Secretary join in, the establishment of a State/Federal task force or some other joint planning or coordination arrangement when industry interest exists for OCS mineral leasing or geological information appears to support the leasing of OCS minerals in specific areas. Participation in joint State/Federal task forces or other arrangements will afford the adjacent State Governor(s) opportunity for access to available data and information about the area; knowledge of progress made in the leasing process and of the results of subsequent exploration and development activities; facilitate the resolution of issues of mutual interest; and provide a mechanism for planning, coordination, consultation, and other activities which the Secretary and the Governor(s) may identify as contributing to the leasing process.
              (b) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements are to be constituted pursuant to such terms and conditions (consistent with Federal law and these regulations) as the Secretary and the adjacent State Governor(s) may agree.
              (c) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements will provide a forum which the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) may use for planning, consultation, and coordination on concerns associated with the offering of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur for lease.
              (d) With respect to the activities authorized under these regulations each State/Federal task force may make recommendations to the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) concerning:
              (1) The identification of areas in which OCS minerals might be offered for lease;
              (2) The potential for conflicts between the exploration and development of OCS mineral resources, other users and uses of the area, and means for resolution or mitigation of these conflicts;
              (3) The economic feasibility of developing OCS mineral resources in the area proposed for leasing;
              (4) Potential environmental problems and measures that might be taken to mitigate these problems;
              (5) Development of guidelines and procedures for safe, environmentally responsible exploration and development practices; and
              (6) Other issues of concern to the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s).
              (e) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements might also be used to conduct or oversee research, studies, or reports (e.g., Environmental Impact Statements).
            
            
              § 581.14
              OCS mining area identification.
              The Secretary, after considering the available OCS mineral resources and environmental data and information, the recommendation of any joint State/Federal task force established pursuant to § 581.13 of this part, and the comments received from interested parties, shall select the tracts to be considered for offering for lease. The selected tracts will be considered in the environmental analysis conducted for the proposed lease offering.
            
            
              § 581.15
              Tract size.
              The size of the tracts to be offered for lease shall be as determined by the Secretary and specified in the leasing notice. It is intended that tracts offered for lease be sufficiently large to include potentially minable OCS mineral orebodies. When the presence of any minable orebody is unknown and additional prospecting is needed to discover and delineate OCS minerals, the size of tracts specified in the leasing notice may be relatively large.
            
            
              § 581.16
              Proposed leasing notice.

              (a) Prior to offering OCS minerals in an area for lease, the Director shall assess the available information including recommendations of any joint State/Federal task force established pursuant to § 581.13 of this part to determine lease sale procedures to be prescribed and to develop a proposed leasing notice which sets out the proposed primary term of the OCS mineral leases to be offered; lease stipulations including measures to mitigate potentially adverse impacts on the environment; and such rental, royalty, and other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice.

              (b) The proposed leasing notice shall be sent to the Governor(s) of any adjacent State(s), and a Notice of its availability shall be published in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the publication of the leasing notice.
              (c) Written comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) submitted within 60 days after publication of the Notice of Availability of the proposed leasing notice shall be considered by the Secretary.
              (d) Prior to publication of the leasing notice, the Secretary shall respond in writing to the comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) stating the reasons for accepting or rejecting the Governor's recommendations, or for implementing any alternative mutually acceptable approach identified in consultation with the Governor(s) as a means to provide a reasonable balance between the National interest and the well being of the citizens of the adjacent State.
            
            
              § 581.17

              (a) The OCS minerals shall be offered by competitive, cash bonus bidding under terms and conditions specified in the leasing notice and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
              (b)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of sealed bids, such bids received in response to the leasing notice shall be opened at the place, date, and time specified in the leasing notice. The sole purpose of opening bids is to publicly announce and record the bids received, and no bids shall be accepted or rejected at that time.
              (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all sealed bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
              (3) In the event the highest bids are tie bids when using sealed bidding procedures, the tied bidders may be permitted to submit oral bids to determine the highest cash bonus bidder.
              (c)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of oral bids, oral bids shall be received at the place, time, and date and in accordance with the procedures specified in the leasing notice.
              (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject all oral bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.

              (d) When the leasing notice specifies the use of deferred cash bonus bidding, bids shall be received in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate. The high bid will be determined based upon the net present value of each total bid. The appropriate discount rate will be specified in the leasing notice. High bidders using the deferred bonus option shall pay a minimum of 20 percent of the cash bonus bid prior to lease issuance. At least a total of 60 percent of the cash bonus bid shall be due on or before the 5th anniversary of the lease, and payment of the remainder of the cash bonus bid shall be due on the 10th anniversary of the lease. The lessee shall submit a bond guaranteeing payment of the deferred portion of the bonus, in accordance with § 581.33.
            
            
              § 581.19
              Lease term.
              An OCS mineral lease for OCS minerals other than sand and gravel shall be for a primary term of not less than 20 years as stipulated in the leasing notice. The primary lease term for each OCS mineral shall be determined based on exploration and development requirements for the OCS minerals being offered by the Secretary. An OCS mineral lease for sand and gravel shall be for a primary term of 10 years unless otherwise stipulated in the leasing notice. A lease will continue beyond the specified primary term for so long thereafter as leased OCS minerals are being produced in accordance with an approved mining operation or the lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease and the regulations in this chapter under which a lessee can earn continuance of the OCS mineral lease in effect.
            
            
              § 581.20

              § 581.21
              Award of leases.
              (a)(1) The decision of the Director on bids shall be the final action of the Department, subject only to reconsideration by the Secretary, pursuant to a written request in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The delegation of review authority to the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall not be applicable to decisions on high bids for leases in the OCS.
              (2) Any bidder whose bid is rejected by the Director may file a written request for reconsideration with the Secretary within 15 days of notice of rejection, accompanied by a statement of reasons with a copy to the Director. The Secretary shall respond in writing either affirming or reversing the decision.

              (b) Written notice of the Director's action in accepting or rejecting bids shall be transmitted promptly to those bidders whose deposits have been held.

            Subpart C—Financial Considerations
            
              § 581.26
              Payments.
              (a) For sealed bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of the total amount bid is required to be submitted with the bid. The percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in the leasing notice. The remittance may be made in cash or by Federal Reserve check, commercial check, bank draft, money order, certified check, or cashier's check made payable to “Department of the Interior—BOEM.” Payment of this portion of the bonus bid may not be made by Electronic Funds Transfer.
              (b) For oral bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of the total amount bid must be submitted to the official designated in the leasing notice following the completion of the oral bidding. The percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in the leasing notice. Payment of this portion of the bonus bid must be made by Electronic Fund Transfer within the timeframe specified in the leasing notice.
              (c) The deposit received from high bidders will be placed in a Treasury account pending acceptance or rejection of the bid. Other bids submitted under paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the bidders. If the high bid is subsequently rejected, an amount equal to that deposited with the high bid will be returned according to applicable regulations.
              (d) The balance of the winning bonus bid and all rentals and royalties must be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of this part, the Leasing Notice, and subchapter A of this chapter.

              (e) For each lease issued pursuant to this subpart, there shall be one person identified who shall be solely responsible for all payments due and payable under the provisions of the lease. The single responsible person shall be designated as the payor for the lease and shall be so identified on the Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report (P&R) (Form ONRR-4430) in accordance with 30 CFR 1210.201 of this title. The designated person shall be responsible for all bonus, rental, and royalty payments.
              (f) Royalty shall be computed at the rate specified in the leasing notice, and paid in value unless the Secretary elects to have the royalty delivered in kind.
              (g) For leases which provide for minimum royalty payments, each lessee shall pay the minimum royalty specified in the lease at the end of each lease year beginning with the lease year in which production royalty is paid (whether the full amount specified in the lease or 1/2 the amount specified in the lease pursuant to § 581.28(b) on this part) of OCS minerals produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from the leasehold.
              (h)(1) Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be in accordance with the regulations in part 1206 of chapter XII. The value used in the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The value, for royalty purposes, shall be the gross proceeds received by the lessee for produced substances at the point the product is produced and placed in its first marketable condition, consistent with prevailing practices in the industry. In establishing the value, the Director shall consider, in this order:
              (i) The price received by the lessee;
              (ii) Commodity and spot market transactions;
              (iii) Any other valuation method proposed by the lessee and approved by the Director; and
              (iv) Value or cost netback.
              (2) For non-arm's length transactions, the first benchmark will only be accepted if it is not less than the second benchmark.
              (i) All payors must submit payments and payment forms and maintain auditable records in accordance with 30 CFR chapter XII, Subchapter A—Natural Resources Revenue.
            
            
              § 581.27
              Annual rental.
              (a) The annual lease rental shall be due and payable in accordance with the provisions of this section. No rental shall be due or payable under a lease commencing with the first lease anniversary date following the commencement of royalty payments on leasehold production computed on the basis of the royalty rate specified in the lease except that annual rental shall be due for any year in which production from the leasehold is not subject to royalty pursuant to § 581.28.
              (b) Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease, no annual rental payment shall be due during the first 5 years in the life of a lease.
              (c) The leasee shall pay an annual rental in the amount specified in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease not later than the last day prior to the commencement of the rental year.
              (d) A rental adjustment schedule and amount may be specified in a leasing notice and subsequently issued lease when a variance is warranted by geologic, geographic, technical, or economic conditions.
            
            
              § 581.28
              Royalty.

              (a) The royalty due the lessor on OCS minerals produced (i.e., sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from a lease shall be set out in a separate schedule attached to and made a part of each lease and shall be as specified in the leasing notice. The royalty due on production shall be based on a percentage of the value or amount of the OCS mineral(s) produced, a sum assessed per unit of product, or other such method as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice. When the royalty specified is a sum assessed per unit of product, the amount of the royalty shall be subject to an annual adjustment based on changes in the appropriate price index, when specified in the leasing notice. When the royalty is specified as a percentage of the value or amount of the OCS minerals produced, the Secretary will notify the lessee when and where royalty is to be delivered in kind. Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be in accordance with the regulations in part 1206 of chapter XII. The value used in the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.
              
              (b) When prescribed in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease, royalty due on OCS minerals produced from a leasehold will be reduced for up to any 5 consecutive years, as specified by the lessee prior to the commencement of production, during the 1st through 15th year in the life of the lease. No royalty shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year period that occurs during the 1st through 10th years in the life of the lease, and a royalty of one-half the amount specified in the lease shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year period that occurs in the 11th through 15th year in the life of the lease. The lessee shall pay the amount specified in the lease rental for any royalty free year. The minimum royalty specified in the lease shall apply during any year of reduced royalty.
            
            
              § 581.29
              Royalty valuation.
              Unless stated otherwise in the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease, product valuation will be in accordance with the regulations in part 1206 of chapter XII. The value used in the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.
            
            
              § 581.30
              Minimum royalty.
              Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice, each lease issued pursuant to the regulations in this part shall require the payment of a specified minimum annual royalty beginning with the year in which OCS minerals are produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from the leasehold except that the annual rentals shall apply during any year that royalty free production is in effect pursuant to § 581.28(b). Minimum royalty payments shall be offset by royalty paid on production during the lease year. Minimum royalty payments are due at the beginning of the lease year and payable by the end of the month following the end of the lease year for which they are due.
            
            
              § 581.31
              Overriding royalties.
              (a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, an overriding royalty interest may be created by an assignment pursuant to section 8(e) of the Act. The Secretary may deny approval of an assignment which creates an overriding royalty on a lease whenever that denial is determined to be in the interest of conservation, necessary to prevent premature abandonment of a producing mine, or to make possible the mining of economically marginal or low-grade ore deposits. In any case, the total of applicable overriding royalties may not exceed 2.5 percent or one-half the base royalty due the Federal Government, whichever is less.
              (b) No transfer or agreement may be made which creates an overriding royalty interest unless the owner of that interest files an agreement in writing that such interest is subject to the limitations provided in § 581.30 of this part, paragraph (a) of this section, and § 581.32 of this part.
            
            
              § 581.32
              Waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty, or production royalty.
              (a) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, minimum royalty, and/or production royalty prescribed in a lease for a specified time period when the Secretary determines that it is in the National interest, it will result in the conservation of natural resources of the OCS, it will promote development, or the mine cannot be successfully operated under existing conditions.
              (b) An application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty, or production royalty under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed in duplicate with the Director. The application shall contain the serial number(s) of the lease(s), the name of the lessee(s) of record, and the operator(s) if applicable. The application shall either:
              (1)(i) Show the location and extent of all mining operations and a tabulated statement of the minerals mined and subject to royalty for each of the last 12 months immediately prior to filing the application:

              (ii) Contain a detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating the lease, the income from the sale of any lease products, and the amount of all overriding royalties and payments out of production paid to others than the United States; and
              
              (iii) All facts showing whether or not the mine(s) can be successfully operated under the royalty fixed in the lease; or
              (2) If no production has occurred from the lease, show that the lease cannot be successfully operated under the rental, royalty, and other conditions specified in the lease.
              (c) The applicant for a waiver, suspension, or reduction under this section shall file documentation that the lessee and the royalty holders agree to a reduction of all other royalties from the lease so that the aggregate of all other royalties does not exceed one-half the amount of the reduced royalties that would be paid to the United States.
            
            
              § 581.33
              Bonds and bonding requirements.
              (a) When the leasing notice specifies that payment of a portion of the bonus bid can be deferred, the lessee shall be required to submit a surety or personal bond to guarantee payment of a deferred portion of the bid. Upon the payment of the full amount of the cash bonus bid, the lessee's bond will be released.
              (b) All bonds to guarantee payment of the deferred portion of the high cash bonus bid furnished by the lessee must be in a form or on a form approved by the Deputy Director. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety.
              (1) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted (see Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or replacement circulars).
              (2) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of the lease.
              (c) Prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease(s), the lessee shall submit a surety or personal bond as described in § 582.40 of this title. Prior to the approval of a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.

            Subpart D—Assignments and Lease Extensions
            
              § 581.40
              Assignment of leases or interests therein.
              (a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, a lease may be assigned, in whole or in part, pursuant to section 8(e) of the Act to anyone qualified to hold a lease.
              (b) Any approved assignment shall be deemed to be effective on the first day of the lease month following the date that it is submitted to the Director for approval unless by written request the parties request that the effective date be the first of the month in which the Director approves the assignment.
              (c) The assignor shall be liable for all obligations under the lease occurring prior to the effective date of an assignment.
              (d) The assignee shall be liable for all obligations under the lease occurring on or after the effective date of an assignment and shall comply with all terms and conditions of the lease and applicable regulations issued under the Act.
            
            
              § 581.41
              Requirements for filing for transfers.
              (a)(1) All instruments of transfer of a lease or of an interest therein including subleases and assignments of record interest shall be filed in triplicate for approval within 90 days from the date of final execution. They shall include a statement over the transferee's own signature with respect to citizenship and qualifications similar to that required of a lessee and shall contain all of the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties thereto.

              (2) An application for approval of any instrument required to be filed will not be accepted unless a nonrefundable fee of $50 is paid electronically through Pay.gov at: https://www.pay.gov/paygov/ and a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page is included with your application. For any document you are not required to file by these regulations but which you submit for record purposes, you must also pay electronically through Pay.gov a nonrefundable fee of $50 per lease affected, and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page with your document. Such documents may be rejected at the discretion of the authorized officer.
              (b) An attorney in fact signing on behalf of the holder of a lease or sublease, shall furnish evidence of authority to execute the assignment or application for approval and the statement required by § 581.20 of this part.
              (c) Where an assignment creates separate leases, a bond shall be furnished for each of the resulting leases in the amount prescribed in § 582.40 of this title. Where an assignment does not create separate leases, the assignee, if the assignment so provides and the surety consents, may become a joint principal on the bond with the assignor.
              (d) An heir or devisee of a deceased holder of a lease or any interest therein shall be recognized as the lawful successor to such lease or interest if evidence of status as an heir or devisee is furnished in the form of:
              (1) A certified copy of an appropriate order or decree of the court having jurisdiction over the distribution of the estate, or
              (2) If no court action is necessary, the statement of two disinterested persons having knowledge of the fact or a certified copy of the will.
              (e) The heirs or devisee shall file statements that they are the persons named as successors to the estate with evidence of their qualifications to hold such lease or interest therein.
              (f) In the event an heir or devisee is unable to qualify to hold the lease or interest, the heir or devisee shall be recognized as the lawful successor of the deceased and be entitled to hold the lease for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of death of the predecessor in interest.
              (g) Each obligation under any lease and under the regulations in this part shall inure to the heirs, executors, administrators, successors, or assignees of the lease.
            
            
              § 581.42
              Effect of assignment on particular lease.
              (a) When an assignment is made of all the record title to a portion of the acreage in a lease, the assigned and retained portions of the lease area become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such a case, the assignee becomes a lessee of the Government as to the segregated tract that is the subject of the assignment and is bound by the terms of the lease as though the lease had been obtained from the United States in the assignee's own name, and the assignment, after its approval, shall be the basis of a new record. Royalty, minimum royalty, and annual rental provisions of the lease shall apply separately to each segregated portion.
              (b) Each lease of an OCS mineral created by the segregation of a lease under paragraph (a) of this section shall continue in full force and effect for the remainder of the primary term of the original lease and so long thereafter as minerals are produced from the portion of the lease created by segregation in accordance with operations approved by the Director or the lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease or regulations for earning the continuation of the lease in effect.
            
            
              § 581.43
              Effect of suspensions on lease term.
              (a) If the BSEE Director orders the suspension of either operations or production, or both, with respect to any lease in its primary term, the primary term of the lease shall be extended by a period of time equivalent to the period of the directed suspension.
              (b) If the BSEE Director orders or approves the suspension of either operations or production, or both, with respect to any lease that is in force beyond its primary term, the term of the lease shall not be deemed to expire so long as the suspension remains in effect.
            
          
          
            
            Subpart E—Termination of Leases

              (a) A lease or any part thereof may be surrendered by the record title holder by filing a written relinquishment with the Director. A relinquishment shall take effect on the date it is filed subject to the continued obligation of the lessee and the surety to:
              (1) Make all payments due, including any accrued rentals and royalties; and
              (2) Abandon all operations, remove all facilities, and clear the land to be relinquished to the satisfaction of the Director.
              (b) Upon relinquishment of a lease, the data and information submitted under the lease will no longer be held confidential and will be available to the public.
            
            
              § 581.47
              Cancellation of leases.
              (a) Whenever the owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after mailing of notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner at the owner's record post office address, the Secretary may cancel the lease pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be entitled to compensation. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial review as provided by section 23(b) of the Act.
              (b) Whenever the owner of any producing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the Act, the Secretary may cancel the lease only after judicial proceedings pursuant to section 5(d) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be entitled to compensation.
              (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, may be canceled by the Secretary upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been afforded to the lessee.
              (d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the following:
              (1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines after a hearing that:
              (i) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral (in areas leased or not leased), to the National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment;
              (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
              (iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing such lease in force;
              (2) Cancellation shall not occur unless and until operations under such lease shall have been under suspension or temporary prohibition by the Secretary, with due extension of any lease term continuously for a period of 5 years, or for a lesser period upon request of the lessee; and
              (3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser of:
              (i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, or

              (ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease (plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or parties and be issued the lease in question.
              
              (iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:
              (A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to section (5)(d) of the Act;
              (B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of applicable Federal Law; or
              (C) The lessee(s) of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with a provision of the Act, the lease, or regulations issued under the Act, and the noncompliance continues for a period of 30 days or more after the mailing of a notice of noncompliance by registered or certified letter to the lessee(s).

              (a) A report of the amount and value of each OCS mineral produced from each lease shall be made by the payor for the lease for each calendar month, beginning with the month in which approved testing, development, or production activities are initiated and shall be filed in duplicate with the Director on or before the 20th day of the succeeding month, unless an extension of time for the filing of such report is granted by the Director. The report shall disclose accurately and in detail all operations conducted during each month and present a general summary of the status of leasehold activities. The report shall be submitted each month until the lease is terminated or relinquished unless the Director authorizes omission of the report during an approved suspension of production. The report shall show for each calendar month the location of each mining and processing activity; the number of days operations were conducted; the identity, quantity, quality, and value of each OCS mineral produced, sold, transferred, used or otherwise disposed of; identity, quantity, and quality of an inventory maintained prior to the point of royalty determination; and other information as may be required by the Director.
              (b) The lessee shall submit a status report on exploration and/or testing activities under an approved Delineation or Testing Plan to the Director within 30 days of the close of each calendar quarter which shall include:
              (1) A summary of activities conducted;
              (2) A listing of all geophysical and geochemical data acquired and developed such as acoustic or seismic profiling records;

              (5) Such other descriptions of the activities conducted as may be specified by the Director; and

              (6) Records of all samples from core drilling or other tests made on the lease. The records shall be in such form that the location and direction of the samples can be accurately located on a map. The records shall include logs of all strata penetrated and conditions encountered, such as minerals, water, gas, or unusual conditions, and copies of analyses of all samples analyzed.
              
              (d) The lessee shall report the results of environmental monitoring activities required in § 582.28 of this part and shall submit such other environmental data as the Director may require to conform with the requirements of these regulations.
              (e)(1) All maps shall be appropriately marked with reference to official lease boundaries and elevations marked with reference to sea level. When required by the Director, vertical projections and cross sections shall accompany plan views. The maps shall be kept current and submitted to the Director annually, or more often when required by the Director.

              (i) When special forms or reports other than those referred to in the regulations in this part may be necessary, instructions for the filing of such forms or reports will be given by the Director.
            
            
              § 582.30
              Right of use and easement.
              (a) A right of use and easement that includes any area subject to a lease issued or maintained under the Act shall be granted only after the lessee has been notified by the requestor and afforded the opportunity to comment on the request. A holder of a right under a right of use and easement shall exercise that right in accordance with the requirements of the regulations in this part. A right of use and easement shall be exercised only in a manner which does not interfere unreasonably with operations of any lessee on its lease.
              (b) Once a right of use and easement has been exercised, the right shall continue, beyond the termination of any lease on which it may be situated, as long as it is demonstrated to the Director that the right of use and easement is being exercised by the holder of the right and that the right of use and easement continues to serve the purpose specified in the grant. If the right of use and easement extends beyond the termination of any lease on which the right may be situated or if it is situated on an unleased portion of the OCS, the rights of all subsequent lessees shall be subject to such right. Upon termination of a right of use and easement, the holder of the right shall abandon the premises in the same manner that a lessee abandons activities on a lease to the satisfaction of the Director.

              § 582.40
              Bonds.
              (a) Pursuant to the requirements for a bond in § 581.33 of this title, prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease, the lessee shall submit a surety or personal bond to cover the lessee's royalty and other obligations under the lease as specified in this section.
              (b) All bonds furnished by a lessee or operator must be in a form approved by the Deputy Director. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety.
              (c) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted (see Department of Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or replacement circulars).
              (d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of the lease.
              (e) A bond in the minimum amount of $50,000 to cover the lessee's obligations under the lease shall be submitted prior to the commencement of any activity on a leasehold. A $50,000 bond shall not be required on a lease if the lessee already maintains or furnishes a $300,000 bond conditioned on compliance with the terms of leases for OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur held by the lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is located. A bond submitted pursuant to § 556.58(a) of this chapter may be amended to include the aforementioned condition for compliance. Prior to approval of a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.
              (f) For the purposes of this section there are three areas:
              (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Ocean;
              (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
              (3) The area offshore the coast of Alaska.
              (g) A separate bond shall be required for each area. An operator's bond may be submitted for a specific lease(s) in the same amount as the lessee's bond(s) applicable to the lease(s) involved.
              (h) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the surety bond and the surety's liability thereunder shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.
              (i) After default, the principal shall, within 6 months after notice or within such shorter period as may be fixed by the Director, either post a new bond or increase the existing bond to the amount previously held. In lieu thereof, the principal may, within that time, file separate or substitute bonds for each lease. Failure to meet these requirements may result in a suspension of operations including production on leases covered by such bonds.
              (j) The Director shall not consent to termination of the period of liability of any bond unless an acceptable alternative bond has been filed or until all the terms and conditions of the lease covered by the bond have been met.

              § 583.305
              How will BOEM determine if a project qualifies?
              BOEM will make a determination as to whether the project, as described in § 583.300, qualifies for a negotiated noncompetitive agreement for the use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources. Within 15 business days of receipt of the application, BOEM will determine if the application is complete or will request additional information. After it has determined the application is complete, BOEM will review the application and notify the applicant in writing whether the project qualifies for an agreement. In determining whether a project qualifies for an agreement, BOEM will consider, among other criteria, the following:
              (a) The project purpose;
              (b) Other uses of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources from the same borrow area that are currently or were previously authorized by BOEM for other projects or programs, including the location, type and volume of such resources;
              (c) The project funding source(s) and amounts;

              (h) The applicant's background and experience working on similar projects or activities;
              (i) Whether the project operations can be conducted in a manner that protects the environment and promotes orderly development of OCS mineral resources;
              (j) Whether activities can be conducted in a manner that does not pose a threat of serious harm or damage to, or waste of, any natural resource, any life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment; and

              (k) Whether the project is consistent with the requirements of applicable statutes and their implementing regulations, which may include, but are not limited to, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act (MDRPRA) (33 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.), the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA) (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.), and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), MARPOL-Annex V Treaty.

              (b) If BOEM decides not to enter into such an agreement, BOEM will inform the applicant of its reasons for not doing so. An applicant may ask the BOEM Director for reconsideration of this decision, in accordance with § 583.125(a).
              (c) If BOEM has decided to enter into a negotiated noncompetitive agreement with the applicant, BOEM will negotiate the terms and conditions of the agreement with the applicant and prepare a draft agreement for the applicant's review.
              (d) After considering comments and suggestions from the applicant, BOEM, at its discretion, may finalize the agreement and distribute it to the applicant for signature.
              (e) Upon receipt of the agreement with the applicant's signature, BOEM will execute the agreement. A copy of the executed agreement will be mailed to the parties.

              (a) Unless otherwise provided for in the agreement, the parties to the agreement may submit to BOEM a written request to extend or modify an agreement. BOEM is under no obligation to extend or modify an agreement and cannot be held liable for the consequences of the expiration of an agreement. With the exception of paragraph (b) of this section, any such requests must be made at least 180 days before the term of the agreement expires. BOEM will respond to the request for modification within 30 days of receipt and request any necessary information and evaluations to comply with § 583.305.

              (b) The Director may immediately suspend and subsequently terminate any agreement issued under this part when:

              (1) There is noncompliance with the agreement, pursuant to § 583.330 (a); or
              
              (2) It is necessary for reasons of national security or defense; or
              (3) The Director determines that:
              (i) Continued activity under the agreement would cause serious harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance;
              (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
              (iii) The advantages of termination outweigh the advantages of continuing the agreement.
              (c) The Director will immediately notify the parties to the agreement of the suspension or termination. The Director will also mail a letter to the parties to the agreement at their record post office address with notice of any suspension or termination and the cause for such action.
              (d) In the event that BOEM terminates an agreement under this section, none of the parties to the agreement will be entitled to compensation as a result of expenses or lost revenues that may result from the termination.

              (6) Protection of National security interests of the United States;
              (7) Protection of the rights of other authorized users of the OCS;
              (8) A fair return to the United States;
              (9) Prevention of interference with reasonable uses (as determined by the Secretary or Director) of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas;
              (10) Consideration of the location of and any schedule relating to a lease or grant under this part for an area of the OCS, and any other use of the sea or seabed;

              § 585.111
              When and how does BOEM charge me processing fees on a case-by-case basis?

              (a) BOEM will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis under the procedures in this section with regard to any application or request under this part if we decide at any time that the preparation of a particular document or study is necessary for the application or request and it will have a unique processing cost, such as the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
              (1) Processing costs will include contract oversight and efforts to review and approve documents prepared by contractors, whether the contractor is paid directly by the applicant or through BOEM.
              (2) We may apply a standard overhead rate to direct processing costs.
              (b) We will assess the ongoing processing fee for each individual application or request according to the following procedures:
              (1) Before we process your application or request, we will give you a written estimate of the proposed fee based on reasonable processing costs.
              (2) You may comment on the proposed fee.
              (3) You may:
              (i) Ask for our approval to perform, or to directly pay a contractor to perform, all or part of any document, study, or other activity according to standards we specify, thereby reducing our costs for processing your application or request; or
              (ii) Ask to pay us to perform, or contract for, all or part of any document, study, or other activity.
              (4) We will then give you the final estimate of the processing fee amount with payment terms and instructions after considering your comments and any BOEM-approved work you will do.
              (i) If we encounter higher or lower processing costs than anticipated, we will re-estimate our reasonable processing costs following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, but we will not stop ongoing processing unless you do not pay in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
              (ii) Once processing is complete, we will refund to you the amount of money that we did not spend on processing costs.
              (5)(i) Consistent with the payment and billing terms provided in the final estimate, we will periodically estimate what our reasonable processing costs will be for a specific period and will bill you for that period. Payment is due to us 30 days after you receive your bill. We will stop processing your document if you do not pay the bill by the date payment is due.
              (ii) If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than our reasonable processing costs for the period, we will adjust the next billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a payment without our prior written approval.
              (6) You must pay the entire fee before we will issue the final document or take final action on your application or request.
              (7) You may appeal our estimated processing costs in accordance with the regulations in 43 CFR part 4. We will not process the document further until the appeal is resolved, unless you pay the fee under protest while the appeal is pending. If the appeal results in a decision changing the proposed fee, we will adjust the fee in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If we adjust the fee downward, we will not pay interest.

                § 585.200
                What rights are granted with a lease issued under this part?
                (a) A lease issued under this part grants the lessee the right, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, including but not limited to those required under the FERC hydrokinetic licensing process, and complying with all provisions of this part, to occupy, and install and operate facilities on, a designated portion of the OCS for the purpose of conducting:
                (1) Commercial activities; or
                
                (2) Other limited activities that support, result from, or relate to the production of energy from a renewable energy source.
                (b) A lease issued under this part confers on the lessee the right to one or more project easements without further competition for the purpose of installing gathering, transmission, and distribution cables; pipelines; and appurtenances on the OCS as necessary for the full enjoyment of the lease.

                § 585.201
                How will BOEM issue leases?
                BOEM will issue leases on a competitive basis, as provided under §§ 585.210 through 585.225. However, if we determine after public notice of a proposed lease that there is no competitive interest, we will issue leases noncompetitively, as provided under §§ 585.230 and 585.232. We will issue leases on forms approved by BOEM and will include terms, conditions, and stipulations identified and developed through the process set forth in §§ 585.211 and 585.231.

                What types of leases will BOEM issue?
                BOEM may issue leases on the OCS for the assessment and production of renewable energy and may authorize a combination of specific activities. We may issue commercial leases or limited leases.
              
              
                § 585.203
                With whom will BOEM consult before issuance of a lease?
                For leases issued under this part, through either the competitive or noncompetitive process, BOEM, prior to issuing the lease, will coordinate and consult with relevant Federal agencies (including, in particular, those agencies involved in planning activities that are undertaken to avoid or minimize conflicts among users and maximize the economic and ecological benefits of the OCS, including multifaceted spatial planning efforts), the Governor of any affected State, the executive of any affected local government, and any affected Indian Tribe, as directed by subsections 8(p)(4) and (7) of the OCS Lands Act or other relevant Federal laws. Federal statutes that require BOEM to consult with interested parties or Federal agencies or to respond to findings of those agencies, including the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). BOEM also engages in consultation with state and tribal historic preservation officers pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

                § 585.206
                What is the lease size?
                (a) BOEM will determine the size for each lease based on the area required to accommodate the anticipated activities. The processes leading to both competitive and noncompetitive issuance of leases will provide public notice of the lease size adopted. We will delineate leases by using mapped OCS blocks or portions, or aggregations of blocks.
                (b) The lease size includes the minimum area that will allow the lessee sufficient space to develop the project and manage activities in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of this part.

                How does BOEM initiate the competitive leasing process?
                BOEM may publish in the Federal Register a public notice of Request for Interest to assess interest in leasing all or part of the OCS for activities authorized in this part. BOEM will consider information received in response to a Request for Interest to determine whether there is competitive interest for scheduling sales and issuing leases. We may prepare and issue a national, regional, or more specific schedule of lease sales pertaining to one or more types of renewable energy.
              
              
                § 585.211
                What is the process for competitive issuance of leases?

                BOEM will use auctions to award leases on a competitive basis. We will publish details of the process to be employed for each lease sale auction in the Federal Register. For each lease sale, we will publish a Proposed Sale Notice and a Final Sale Notice. Individual lease sales will include steps such as:
                (a) Call for Information and Nominations (Call). BOEM will publish in the Federal Register Calls for Information and Nominations for leasing in specified areas. The comment period following issuance of a Call will be 45 days. In this document, we may:
                (1) Request comments on areas which should receive special consideration and analysis;
                (2) Request comments concerning geological conditions (including bottom hazards); archaeological sites on the seabed or nearshore; multiple uses of the proposed leasing area (including navigation, recreation, and fisheries); and other socioeconomic, biological, and environmental information; and
                (3) Suggest areas to be considered by the respondents for leasing.
                (b) Area Identification. BOEM will identify areas for environmental analysis and consideration for leasing. We will do this in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, States, local governments, affected Indian Tribes, and other interested parties.
                (1) We may consider for lease those areas nominated in response to the Call for Information and Nominations, together with other areas that BOEM determines are appropriate for leasing.
                (2) We will evaluate the potential effect of leasing on the human, marine, and coastal environments, and develop measures to mitigate adverse impacts, including lease stipulations.
                (3) We will consult to develop measures, including lease stipulations and conditions, to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment; and
                (4) We may hold public hearings on the environmental analysis after appropriate notice.
                (c) Proposed Sale Notice. BOEM will publish the Proposed Sale Notice in the Federal Register and send it to the Governor of any affected State, any Indian Tribe that might be affected, and the executive of any local government that might be affected. The comment period following issuance of a Proposed Sale Notice will be 60 days.
                (d) Final Sale Notice. BOEM will publish the Final Sale Notice in the Federal Register at least 30 days before the date of the sale.

                § 585.212
                What is the process BOEM will follow if there is reason to believe that competitors have withdrawn before the Final Sale Notice is issued?
                BOEM may decide to end the competitive process before the Final Sale Notice if we have reason to believe that competitors have withdrawn and competition no longer exists. We will issue a second public notice of Request for Interest and consider comments received to confirm that there is no competitive interest.

                (a) If, after reviewing comments in response to the notice of Request for Interest, BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in the lease area, and one party wishes to acquire a lease, we will discontinue the competitive process and will proceed with the noncompetitive process set forth in § 585.231(d) through (i) following receipt of the acquisition fee specified in § 585.502(a).
                
                (b) If, after reviewing comments in response to the notice of Request for Interest, BOEM determines that competitive interest in the lease area continues to exist, we will continue with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.211 through 585.225.

                (1) We open the sealed bids at the place, date, and hour specified in the Final Sale Notice for the sole purpose of publicly announcing and recording the bids. We do not accept or reject any bids at that time.
                (2) We reserve the right to reject any and all high bids, including a bid for any proposal submitted under the multiple-factor bidding format, regardless of the amount offered or bidding system used. The reasons for the rejection of a winning bid may include, but are not necessarily limited to, insufficiency, illegality, anti-competitive behavior, administrative error, and the presence of unusual bidding patterns. We intend to accept or reject all high bids within 90 days, but we may extend that time if necessary.
                (b) If we use ascending bidding, we may, in the Final Sale Notice, reserve the right to accept the winning bid solely based on its being the highest bid submitted by a qualified bidder (qualified to be an OCS lessee under § 585.107).
                (c) If we use two-stage bidding and the auction concludes with
                (i) An ascending bidding stage, the winning bid will be determined as stated in paragraph (b) of this section; or
                (ii) A sealed bidding stage, the winning bid will be determined as stated in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (d) If we use multiple-factor bidding, determination of the winning bid for any proposal submitted will be made by a panel composed of members selected by BOEM. The details of the process will be described in the Final Sale Notice.
                (e) We will send a written notice of our decision to accept or reject bids to all bidders whose deposits we hold.
              
              
                § 585.223
                What does BOEM do if there is a tie for the highest bid?
                (a) Unless otherwise specified in the Final Sale Notice, except in the first stage of a two-stage bidding auction, if more than one bidder on a lease submits the same high bid amount, the winning bidder will be determined by a further round or stage of bidding as described in the Final Sale Notice.
                (b) The winning bidder will be subject to final confirmation following determination of bid adequacy.

                If we accept your bid, we will send you a notice with three copies of the lease form.
                (a) Within 10 business days after you receive the lease copies, you must:
                (1) Execute the lease;
                (2) File financial assurance as required under §§ 585.515 through 585.537; and

                (c) When you execute three copies of the lease and return the copies to us, we will execute the lease on behalf of the United States and send you one fully executed copy.
                (d) You will forfeit your deposit if you do not execute and return the lease within 10 business days of receipt, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations or terms of the Final Sale Notice.
                (e) We may extend the 10 business day time period for executing and returning the lease if we determine the delay to be caused by events beyond your control.
                (f) We reserve the right to withdraw an OCS area in which we have held a lease sale before you and BOEM execute the lease in that area. If we exercise this right, we will refund your bid deposit, without interest.
                (g) If the awarded lease is executed by an agent acting on behalf of the bidder, the bidder must submit, along with the executed lease, written evidence that the agent is authorized to act on behalf of the bidder.

                (h) BOEM will consider the highest submitted qualified bid to be the winning bid when bidding occurs under the systems described in § 585.221(a)(1) through (5). We will determine the winning bid for proposals submitted under the multiple-factor bidding format on the basis of selection by the panel as specified in § 585.222(d) when the bidding system under § 585.221(a)(6) is used. We will refund the deposit on all other bids.

                May I request a lease if there is no Call?
                You may submit an unsolicited request for a commercial lease or a limited lease under this part. Your unsolicited request must contain the following information:
                (a) The area you are requesting for lease.

                How will BOEM process my unsolicited request for a noncompetitive lease?
                (a) BOEM will consider unsolicited requests for a lease on a case-by-case basis and may issue a lease noncompetitively in accordance with this part. We will not consider an unsolicited request for a lease under this part that is proposed in an area of the OCS that is scheduled for a lease sale under this part.
                (b) BOEM will issue a public notice of a request for interest relating to your proposal and consider comments received to determine if competitive interest exists.
                (c) If BOEM determines that competitive interest exists in the lease area:
                (1) BOEM will proceed with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.225;
                (2) If you submit a bid for the lease area in a competitive lease sale, your acquisition fee will be applied to the deposit for your bonus bid; and
                (3) If you do not submit a bid for the lease area in a competitive lease sale, BOEM will not refund your acquisition fee.

                (d) If BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in a lease, we will publish in the Federal Register a notice of Determination of No Competitive Interest. After BOEM publishes this notice, you will be responsible for submitting any required consistency certification and necessary data and information pursuant to 15 CFR part 930, subpart D to the applicable State CZMA agency or agencies and BOEM.
                (e) BOEM will coordinate and consult with affected Federal agencies, State, and local governments, and affected Indian tribes in the review of noncompetitive lease requests.
                (f) After completing the review of your lease request, BOEM may offer you a noncompetitive lease.

                (g) If you accept the terms and conditions of the lease, then we will issue the lease, and you must comply with all terms and conditions of your lease and all applicable provisions of this part. If we issue you a lease, we will send you a notice with 3 copies of the lease form.
                (1) Within 10 business days after you receive the lease copies you must:
                (i) Execute the lease;
                (ii) File financial assurance as required under §§ 585.515 through 585.537; and

                (a) If you submit an area of interest for a possible lease and BOEM receives no competing submissions in response to the RFI or Call, we may inform you that there does not appear to be competitive interest, and ask if you wish to proceed with acquiring a lease.
                (b) If you wish to proceed with acquiring a lease, you must submit your acquisition fee as specified in § 585.502(a).

                If I have a commercial lease, how long will my lease remain in effect?
                (a) For commercial leases, the lease terms and applicable automatic extensions are as shown in the following table:
                
                  
                    Lease term

                    (1) Each commercial lease will have a preliminary term of 12 months, within which the lessee must submit: (i) a SAP; or (ii) a combined SAP and Construction and Operations Plan (COP). The preliminary term begins on the effective date of the lease
                    If BOEM receives a SAP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.605 through 585.613 or a SAP/COP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.605 through 585.613 and §§ 585.620 through 585.629, the preliminary term will be extended for the time necessary for us to conduct technical and environmental reviews of the SAP or SAP/COP
                    The SAP must meet the requirements of §§ 585.605 through 585.613. The SAP/COP must meet the requirements of §§ 585.605 through 585.613 and §§ 585.620 through 585.629.
                  
                  
                    (2) A commercial lease will have a site assessment term of five years to conduct site assessment activities and to submit a COP, if a SAP/COP has not been submitted. Your site assessment term begins when BOEM approves your SAP or SAP/COP
                    If we receive a COP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.620 through 585.629, the site assessment term will be automatically extended for the period of time necessary for us to conduct technical and environmental reviews of the COP
                    The COP must meet the requirements of §§ 585.620 through 585.629 of this part.
                  
                  
                    (3) A commercial lease will have an operations term of 25 years, unless a longer term is negotiated by the parties. A request for lease renewal must be submitted two years before the end of the operations term. If you submit a COP, your operations term begins on the date that BOEM approves the COP. If you submit a SAP/COP, your operations term begins on the earliest of the following dates: five years after BOEM approves the SAP/COP; when fabrication begins; or, when installation commences
                     
                    The lease renewal request must meet the requirements in §§ 585.425 through 585.429.
                  
                  
                    
                    (4) A commercial lease may have additional time added to the operations term through a lease renewal. The term of the lease renewal will not exceed the original term of the lease, unless a longer term is negotiated by the parties. The lease renewal term begins upon expiration of the original operations term
                     
                    NOTE: BOEM may also order or grant a suspension of the operations term, as provided in §§ 585.415 through 585.421 thereby effectively extending the term of the lease.
                  
                
                (b) If you do not timely submit a SAP, COP, or SAP/COP, as appropriate, you may request additional time to extend the preliminary or site assessment term of your commercial lease that includes a revised schedule for submission of the plan, as appropriate.

                    If we receive a GAP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.640 through 585.648 of this part, the preliminary term will be automatically extended for the period of time necessary for us to conduct a technical and environmental review of the plans
                    The GAP must meet the requirements of §§ 585.640 through 585.648.

                (c) BOEM may issue leases, RUEs, and ROWs for research activities managed by a Federal agency or a State only in areas for which the Director has determined, after public notice and opportunity to comment, that no competitive interest exists.
                (d) The Director and the head of the Federal agency or the Governor of a requesting State, or their authorized representatives, will negotiate the terms and conditions of such renewable energy leases, RUEs, or ROWs under this provision on a case-by-case basis. The framework for such negotiations, and standard terms and conditions of such leases, RUEs, or ROWs may be set forth in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) or other agreement between BOEM and a Federal agency or a State. The MOA must include the agreement of the head of the Federal agency or the Governor to assure that all subcontractors comply with these regulations, other applicable laws, and terms and conditions of such leases or grants.
                (e) Any lease, RUE, or ROW that BOEM issues to a Federal agency or to a State that authorizes access to an area of the OCS for research activities managed by a Federal agency or a State must include:
                (1) Requirements to comply with all applicable Federal laws; and

                (2) The holder agrees that the United States, its lessees, or other ROW grant or RUE grant holders may use or occupy any part of the ROW grant or RUE grant not actually occupied or necessarily incident to its use for any necessary activities.

                You must submit to BOEM one paper copy and one electronic copy of a request for a new or modified ROW grant or RUE grant. You must submit a separate request for each ROW grant or RUE grant you are requesting. The request must contain the following information:
                (a) The area you are requesting for a ROW grant or RUE grant.
                (b) A general description of your objectives and the facilities that you would use to achieve those objectives.
                (c) A general schedule of proposed activities.

                § 585.306
                What action will BOEM take on my request?
                BOEM will consider requests for ROW grants and RUE grants on a case-by-case basis and may issue a grant competitively, as provided in § 585.308, or noncompetitively if we determine after public notice that there is no competitive interest. BOEM will coordinate and consult with relevant Federal agencies, with the Governor of any affected State, and the executive of any affected local government.
                (a) In response to an unsolicited request for a ROW grant or RUE grant, the BOEM will first determine if there is competitive interest, as provided in § 585.307.

                (b) If BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in a ROW grant or RUE grant, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register of such determination. After BOEM publishes this notice, you will be responsible for submitting any required consistency certification and necessary data and information pursuant to 15 CFR part 930, subpart D to the applicable State CZMA agency or agencies and BOEM. We will establish terms and conditions for the grant in consultation with you.

                § 585.307
                How will BOEM determine whether competitive interest exists for ROW grants and RUE grants?
                To determine whether or not there is competitive interest:
                (a) We will publish a public notice, describing the parameters of the project, to give affected and interested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed ROW grant or RUE grant area.
                (b) We will evaluate any comments received on the notice and make a determination of the level of competitive interest.
              
              
                § 585.308
                How will BOEM conduct an auction for ROW grants and RUE grants?
                (a) If BOEM determines that there is competitive interest, we will:
                (1) Publish a notice of each grant auction in the Federal Register describing auction procedures, allowing interested persons 30 days to comment; and
                (2) Conduct a competitive auction for issuing the ROW grant or RUE grant. The auction process for ROW grants and RUE grants will be conducted following the same process for leases set forth in §§ 585.211 through 585.225.
                (b) If you are the successful bidder in an auction, you must pay the first year's rent, as provided in § 585.316.
              
              
                § 585.309
                When will BOEM issue a noncompetitive ROW grant or RUE grant?
                After completing the review of your grant request, BOEM may offer you a noncompetitive grant.
                (a) If you accept the terms and conditions of the grant, then we will issue the grant, and you must comply with all terms and conditions of your grant and all applicable provisions of this part.
                (b) If you do not accept the terms and conditions, BOEM will not issue a grant.

BOEM will specify in the sale notice the official to whom you must submit the payment, the time by which the official must receive the payment, and the forms of acceptable payment.
                (b) If your high bid is rejected, we will provide a written statement of reasons.

              Noncompliance and Cessation Orders
              
                § 585.400
                What happens if I fail to comply with this part?
                (a) BOEM may take appropriate corrective action under this part if you fail to comply with applicable provisions of Federal law, the regulations in this part, other applicable regulations, any order of the Director, the provisions of a lease or grant issued under this part, or the requirements of an approved plan or other approval under this part.
                (b) BOEM may issue to you a notice of noncompliance if we determine that there has been a violation of the regulations in this part, any order of the Director, or any provision of your lease, grant or other approval issued under this part. When issuing a notice of noncompliance, BOEM will serve you at your last known address.
                (c) A notice of noncompliance will tell you how you failed to comply with this part, any order of the Director, and/or the provisions of your lease, grant or other approval, and will specify what you must do to correct the noncompliance and the time limits within which you must act.
                (d) Failure of a lessee, operator, or grant holder under this part to take the actions specified in a notice of noncompliance within the time limit specified provides the basis for BOEM to issue a cessation order as provided in § 585.401, and/or a cancellation of the lease or grant as provided in § 585.437.

                (e) If BOEM determines that any incident of noncompliance poses an imminent threat of serious or irreparable damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance, BOEM may include with its notice of noncompliance an order directing you to take immediate remedial action to alleviate threats and to abate the violation and, when appropriate, a cessation order.
                (f) The BOEM may assess civil penalties, as authorized by section 24 of the OCS Lands Act, if you fail to comply with any provision of this part or any term of a lease, grant, or order issued under the authority of this part, after notice of such failure and expiration of any reasonable period allowed for corrective action. Civil penalties will be determined and assessed in accordance with the procedures set forth in 30 CFR part 550, subpart N.
                (g) You may be subject to criminal penalties as authorized by section 24 of the OCS Lands Act.
              
              
                § 585.401
                When may BOEM issue a cessation order?
                (a) BOEM may issue a cessation order during the term of your lease or grant when you fail to comply with an applicable law; regulation; order; or provision of a lease, grant, plan, or other BOEM approval under this part. Except as provided in § 585.400(e), BOEM will allow you a period of time to correct any noncompliance before issuing an order to cease activities.
                (b) A cessation order will set forth what measures you are required to take, including reports you are required to prepare and submit to BOEM, to receive approval to resume activities on your lease or grant.
              
              
                § 585.402
                What is the effect of a cessation order?
                (a) Upon receiving a cessation order, you must cease all activities on your lease or grant, as specified in the order. BOEM may authorize certain activities during the period of the cessation order.
                (b) A cessation order will last for the period specified in the order or as otherwise specified by BOEM. If BOEM determines that the circumstances giving rise to the cessation order cannot be resolved within a reasonable time period, the Secretary may initiate cancellation of your lease or grant, as provided in § 585.437.
                (c) A cessation order does not extend the term of your lease or grant for the period you are prohibited from conducting activities.
                (d) You must continue to make all required payments on your lease or grant during the period a cessation order is in effect.

              Designation of Operator
              
                § 585.405
                How do I designate an operator?
                (a) If you intend to designate an operator who is not the lessee or grant holder, you must identify the proposed operator in your SAP (under § 585.610(a)(3)), COP (under § 585.626(b)(2)), or GAP (under § 585.645(b)(3)), as applicable. If no operator is designated in a SAP, COP, or GAP, BOEM will deem the lessee or grant holder to be the operator.
                (b) An operator must be designated in any SAP, COP, or GAP if there is more than one lessee or grant holder for any individual lease or grant.
                (c) Once approved in your plan, the designated operator is authorized to act on your behalf and required to perform activities necessary to comply with the OCS Lands Act, the lease or grant, and the regulations in this part.
                (d) You, or your designated operator, must immediately provide BOEM with a written notification of change of address of the lessee or operator.
                (e) If there is a change in the designated operator, you must provide written notice to BOEM and identify the new designated operator within 72 hours on a form approved by BOEM. The lessee(s) or grantee(s) is the operator and responsible for compliance until BOEM approves designation of the new operator.
                (f) Designation of an operator under any lease or grant issued under this part does not relieve the lessee or grant holder of its obligations under this part or its lease or grant.
                (g) A designated operator performing activities on the lease must comply with all regulations governing those activities and may be held liable or penalized for any noncompliance during the time it was operator, notwithstanding its subsequent resignation.
              
              
                
                § 585.406
                Who is responsible for fulfilling lease and grant obligations?
                (a) When you are not the sole lessee or grantee, you and your co-lessee(s) or co-grantee(s) are jointly and severally responsible for fulfilling your obligations under the lease or grant and the provisions of this part, unless otherwise provided in these regulations.
                (b) If your designated operator fails to fulfill any of your obligations under the lease or grant and this part, BOEM may require you or any or all of your co-lessees or co-grantees to fulfill those obligations or other operational obligations under the OCS Lands Act, the lease, grant, or the regulations.
                (c) Whenever the regulations in this part require the lessee or grantee to conduct an activity in a prescribed manner, the lessee or grantee and operator (if one has been designated) are jointly and severally responsible for complying with the regulations.

                § 585.408
                May I assign my lease or grant interest?
                (a) You may assign all or part of your lease or grant interest, including record title, subject to BOEM approval under this subpart. Each instrument that creates or transfers an interest must describe the entire tract or describe by officially designated subdivisions the interest you propose to create or transfer.
                (b) You may assign a lease or grant interest by submitting one paper copy and one electronic copy of an assignment application to BOEM. The assignment application must include:
                (1) BOEM-assigned lease or grant number;
                (2) A description of the geographic area or undivided interest you are assigning;
                (3) The names of both the assignor and the assignee, if applicable;
                (4) The names and telephone numbers of the contacts for both the assignor and the assignee;
                (5) The names, titles, and signatures of the authorizing officials for both the assignor and the assignee;
                (6) A statement that the assignee agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the lease or grant;
                (7) The qualifications of the assignee to hold a lease or grant under § 585.107; and
                (8) A statement on how the assignee will comply with the financial assurance requirements of §§ 585.515 through 585.537. No assignment will be approved until the assignee provides the required financial assurance.
                (c) If you submit an application to assign a lease or grant, you will continue to be responsible for payments that are or become due on the lease or grant until the date BOEM approves the assignment.
                (d) The assignment takes effect on the date BOEM approves your application.
                (e) You do not need to request an assignment for mergers, name changes, or changes of business form. You must notify BOEM of these events under § 585.109.
              
              
                § 585.409
                How do I request approval of a lease or grant assignment?
                (a) You must request approval of each assignment on a form approved by BOEM, and submit originals of each instrument that creates or transfers ownership of record title or certified copies thereof within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer agreement.
                (b) Any assignee will be subject to all the terms and conditions of your original lease or grant, including the requirement to furnish financial assurance in the amount required in §§ 585.515 through 585.537.
                (c) The assignee must submit proof of eligibility and other qualifications specified in § 585.107.

                § 585.410
                How does an assignment affect the assignor's liability?

                As assignor, you are liable for all obligations, monetary and nonmonetary, that accrued under your lease or grant before BOEM approves your assignment. Our approval of the assignment does not relieve you of these accrued obligations. BOEM may require you to bring the lease or grant into compliance to the extent the obligation accrued before the effective date of your assignment if your assignee or subsequent assignees fail to perform any obligation under the lease or grant.
              
              
                § 585.411

                (a) As assignee, you are liable for all lease or grant obligations that accrue after BOEM approves the assignment. As assignee, you must comply with all the terms and conditions of the lease or grant and all applicable regulations, remedy all existing environmental and operational problems on the lease or grant, and comply with all decommissioning requirements under subpart I of this part.
                (b) Assignees are bound to comply with each term or condition of the lease or grant and the regulations in this subchapter. You are jointly and severally liable for the performance of all obligations under the lease or grant and under the regulations in this part with each prior and subsequent lessee who held an interest from the time the obligation accrued until it is satisfied, unless this part provides otherwise.

                (b) An explanation of why the suspension is necessary in order to ensure full enjoyment of your lease or grant and why it is in the lessor's or grantor's interest to approve the suspension.
                (c) If you do not timely submit a SAP, COP, or GAP, as required, you may request a suspension to extend the preliminary or site assessment term of your lease or grant that includes a revised schedule for submission of a SAP, COP, or GAP, as appropriate.

                When may BOEM order a suspension?
                (a) BOEM may order a suspension under the following circumstances:
                (1) When necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting some or all activities under your lease;
                (2) When continued activities pose an imminent threat of serious or irreparable harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; or
                (3) When the suspension is necessary for reasons of National security or defense.
                (b) If BOEM orders a suspension under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and if you wish to resume activities, we may require you to conduct a site-specific study that evaluates the cause of the harm, the potential damage, and the available mitigation measures.

                (3) We will make the results available to other interested parties and to the public; and
                
                (4) We will use the results of the study and any other information that become available:
                (i) To decide if the suspension order can be lifted; and

                (a) While BOEM evaluates your request for a suspension under § 585.416, you must continue to fulfill your payment obligation until the end of the original term of your lease or grant. If our evaluation goes beyond the end of the original term of your lease or grant, the term of your lease or grant will be extended for the period of time necessary for BOEM to complete its evaluation of your request, but you will not be required to make payments during the time of the extension.
                (b) If BOEM approves your request for a suspension, as provided in § 585.416, we may suspend your payment obligation, as appropriate for the term that is suspended, depending on the reasons for the requested suspension.
                (c) If BOEM orders a suspension, as provided in § 585.417, your payments, as appropriate for the term that is suspended, will be waived during the suspension period.

                (a) BOEM will not approve a suspension request pursuant to § 585.416 for a period longer than 2 years.
                (b) If BOEM determines that the circumstances giving rise to a suspension ordered under § 585.417 cannot be resolved within 5 years, the Secretary may initiate cancellation of the lease or grant, as provided in § 585.437.

                § 585.425
                May I obtain a renewal of my lease or grant before it terminates?
                You may request renewal of the operations term of your lease or the original authorized term of your grant. BOEM, at its discretion, may approve a renewal request to conduct substantially similar activities as were originally authorized under the lease or grant. BOEM will not approve a renewal request that involves development of a type of renewable energy not originally authorized in the lease or grant. BOEM may revise or adjust payment terms of the original lease, as a condition of lease renewal.

                How long is a renewal?

                BOEM will set the term of a renewal at the time of renewal on a case-by-case basis.
                
                (a) For commercial leases, a renewal term will not exceed the original operations term unless a longer term is negotiated by the applicable parties.
                (b) For limited leases, a renewal term will not exceed the original operations term.
                (c) For RUE and ROW grants, a renewal will continue for as long as the associated activities are conducted and facilities properly maintained and used for the purpose for which the grant was made, unless otherwise expressly stated.
              
              
                § 585.428

                (b) You may request a suspension of your lease or grant, as provided in § 585.416, while we consider your request.

                § 585.429
                What criteria will BOEM consider in deciding whether to renew a lease or grant?
                BOEM will consider the following criteria in deciding whether to renew a lease or grant:
                (a) Design life of existing technology.

                (8) The name, title, and signature of your authorizing official (the name, title, and signature must match exactly the name, title, and signature in BOEM qualification records); and
                (9) A statement that you will adhere to the requirements of subpart I of this part.
                (c) If you have submitted an application to relinquish a lease or grant, you will be billed for any outstanding payments that are due before the relinquishment takes effect, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

                § 585.436
                Can BOEM require lease or grant contraction?
                At an interval no more frequent than every 5 years, the BOEM may review your lease or grant area to determine whether the lease or grant area is larger than needed to develop the project and manage activities in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of this part. BOEM will notify you of our proposal to contract the lease or grant area.
                (a) BOEM will give you the opportunity to present orally or in writing information demonstrating that you need the area in question to manage lease or grant activities consistent with these regulations.
                (b) Prior to taking action to contract the lease or grant area, BOEM will issue a decision addressing your contentions that the area is needed.
                (c) You may appeal this decision under § 585.118 of this part.

                § 585.437
                When can my lease or grant be canceled?
                (a) The Secretary will cancel any lease or grant issued under this part upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been afforded to the lessee or grant holder.
                (b) The Secretary may cancel any lease or grant issued under this part when:
                (1) The Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for a hearing that, with respect to the lease or grant that would be canceled, the lessee or grantee has failed to comply with any applicable provision of the OCS Lands Act or these regulations; any order of the Director; or any term, condition or stipulation contained in the lease or grant, and that the failure to comply continued 30 days (or other period BOEM specifies) after you receive notice from BOEM. The Secretary will mail a notice by registered or certified letter to the lessee or grantee at its record post office address;
                (2) The Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for a hearing that you have terminated commercial operations under your COP, as provided in § 585.635, or other approved activities under your GAP, as provided in § 585.656;
                (3) Required by National security or defense; or
                (4) The Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for a hearing that continued activity under the lease or grant:

                (i) Would cause serious harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and
                
                (ii) That the threat of harm or damage would not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
                (iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing the lease or grant in force.

                [76 FR 64623, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended at 79 FR 21623, Apr. 17, 2014]
              
              
                § 585.506
                What operating fees must I pay on a commercial lease?
                If you are generating electricity, you must pay ONRR, under the regulations at 30 CFR part 1218, operating fees on your commercial lease when you begin commercial generation, as described in § 585.503.

                (a) BOEM will determine the annual operating fee for activities relating to the generation of electricity on your lease based on the following formula,
                
                F = M * H * c * P * r,
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  (1) F is the dollar amount of the annual operating fee;
                  (2) M is the nameplate capacity expressed in megawatts;
                  (3) H is the number of hours in a year, equal to 8,760, used to calculate an annual payment;
                  (4) c is the “capacity factor” representing the anticipated efficiency of the facility's operation expressed as a decimal between zero and one;
                  (5) P is a measure of the annual average wholesale electric power price expressed in dollars per megawatt hour, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
                  (6) r is the operating fee rate expressed as a decimal between zero and one.
                
                
                (b) The annual operating fee formula relating to the value of annual electricity generation is restated as:
                
                  
                    F(annual operating fee)
                    
                    =
                    M(nameplate
                      capacity)
                    
                    *
                    H(hours per year)
                    
                    *
                    c(capacity factor)
                    
                    *
                    P(power price)
                    
                    *
                    r(operating fee rate)
                    
                  
                  
                     
                  
                
                (c) BOEM will specify operating fee parameters in the Final Sale Notice for commercial leases issued competitively and in the lease for those issued noncompetitively.

                (1) Unless BOEM specifies otherwise, in the operating fee rate, “r” is 0.02 for each year the operating fee applies when you begin commercial generation of electricity. We may apply a different fee rate for new projects (i.e., a new generation based on new technology) after considering factors such as program objectives, state of the industry, project type, and project potential. Also, we may agree to reduce or waive the fee rate under § 585.510.
                (2) The power price “P,” for each year when the operating fee applies, will be determined annually. The process by which the power price will be determined will be specified in the Final Sale Notice and/or in the lease. BOEM:
                (i) Will use the most recent annual average wholesale power price in the State in which a project's transmission cables make landfall, as published by the DOE, Energy Information Administration (EIA), or other publicly available wholesale power price indices; and

                (ii) May adjust the published average wholesale power price to reflect documented variations by State or within a region and recent market conditions.
                
                (3) BOEM will select the capacity factor “c” based upon applicable analogs drawn from present and future domestic and foreign projects that operate in comparable conditions and on comparable scales.
                (i) Upon the completion of the first year of commercial operations on the lease, BOEM may adjust the capacity factor as necessary (to accurately represent a comparison of actual production over a given period of time with the amount of power a facility would have produced if it had run at full capacity) in a subsequent year.
                (ii) After the first adjustment, BOEM may adjust the capacity factor (to accurately represent a comparison of actual generation over a given period of time with the amount of power a facility would have generated if it had run at full capacity) no earlier than in 5-year intervals from the most recent year that BOEM adjusts the capacity factor.
                (iii) The process by which BOEM will adjust the capacity factor, including any calculations (incorporating an average capacity factor reflecting actual operating experience), will be specified in the lease. The operator or lessee may request review and adjustment of the capacity factor under § 585.510.
                (4) Ten days after the anniversary date of when you began to commercially generate electricity, you must submit to BOEM documentation of the gross annual generation of electricity produced by the generating facility on the lease. You must use the same information collection form as authorized by the EIA for this information.
                (5) For the nameplate capacity “M,” BOEM will use the total installed capacity of the equipment you install, as specified in your approved COP.
                (d) You must submit all operating fee payments to BOEM in accordance with the provisions under 30 CFR 1218.51.
                (e) BOEM will establish the operating fee in the Final Sale Notice or in the lease on a case-by-case basis for:
                (1) Activities that do not relate to the generation of electricity (e.g., hydrogen production), and
                (2) Leases issued for hydrokinetic activities requiring a FERC license.
              
              
                § 585.507
                What rent payments must I pay on a project easement?
                (a) You must pay ONRR, under the regulations at 30 CFR part 1218, a rent fee for your project easement of $5 per acre, subject to a minimum of $450 per year, unless specified otherwise in the Final Sale Notice or lease:
                (1) The size of the project easement area for a cable or a pipeline is the full length of the corridor and a width of 200 feet (61 meters), centered on the cable or pipeline; and
                (2) The size of a project easement area for an accessory platform is limited to the aerial extent of anchor chains and other facilities and devices associated with the accessory.
                (b) You must commence rent payments for your project easement upon our approval of your COP or GAP:
                (1) You must make the first rent payment when the operations term begins, as provided in § 585.500;
                (2) You must submit all subsequent rent payments in accordance with the regulations at 30 CFR 1218.51; and
                (3) You must continue to pay annual rent for your project easement until your lease is terminated.
              
              
                § 585.508
                What rent payments must I pay on ROW grants or RUE grants associated with renewable energy projects?
                (a) For each ROW grant BOEM approves under subpart C of this part, you must pay ONRR, under the regulations at 30 CFR part 1218, an annual rent as follows, unless specified otherwise in the Final Sale Notice:
                (1) A fee of $70 for each nautical mile or part of a nautical mile of the OCS that your ROW crosses; and
                (2) An additional $5 per acre, subject to a minimum of $450 for use of the entire affected area, if you hold a ROW grant that includes a site outside the corridor of a 200-foot width (61 meters), centered on the cable or pipeline. The affected area includes the areal extent of anchor chains, risers, and other devices associated with a site outside the corridor.
                (b) For each RUE grant BOEM approves under subpart C of this part, you must pay ONRR, under the regulations at 30 CFR part 1218, a rent of:
                (1) $5 per acre per year; or
                
                (2) A minimum of $450 per year.
                (c) You must make the rent payments required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on:
                (1) An annual basis;
                (2) For a 5-year period; or
                (3) For multiples of 5 years.
                (d) You must make the first annual rent payment upon approval of your ROW grant or RUE grant request, as provided in § 585.500, and all subsequent rent payments to ONRR in accordance with the regulations at 30 CFR 1218.51.
              
              
                § 585.509
                Who is responsible for submitting lease or grant payments to BOEM?
                (a) For each lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant issued under this part, you must identify one person who is responsible for all payments due and payable under the provisions of the lease or grant. The responsible person identified is designated as the payor, and you must document acceptance of such responsibilities, as provided in 30 CFR 1218.52.
                (b) All payors must submit payments and maintain auditable records in accordance with guidance we issue or any applicable regulations in subchapter A of this chapter. In addition, the lessee or grant holder must also maintain such auditable records.
              
              
                § 585.510

                § 585.515
                What financial assurance must I provide when I obtain my commercial lease?
                (a) Before BOEM will issue your commercial lease or approve an assignment of an existing commercial lease, you (or, for an assignment, the proposed assignee) must guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease by providing either:
                (1) A $100,000 minimum, lease-specific bond; or
                (2) Another approved financial assurance instrument guaranteeing performance up to $100,000, as specified in §§ 585.526 through 585.529.
                (b) You meet the financial assurance requirements under this subpart if your designated lease operator provides a $100,000 minimum, lease-specific bond or other approved financial assurance that guarantees compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease.
                (1) The dollar amount of the minimum, lease-specific financial assurance in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of this section will be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) or a substantially equivalent index if the CPI-U is discontinued; and
                (2) The first CPI-U-based adjustment can be made no earlier than the 5-year anniversary of the adoption of this rule. Subsequent CPI-U-based adjustments may be made every 5 years thereafter.
              
              
                § 585.516
                What are the financial assurance requirements for each stage of my commercial lease?

                (a) The basic financial assurance requirements for each stage of your commercial lease are as follows:
                
                
                  
                    Before BOEM will . . .
                    You must provide . . .
                  
                  
                    (1) Issue a commercial lease or approve an assignment of an existing commercial lease
                    A $100,000 minimum, lease-specific financial assurance.
                  
                  
                    (2) Approve your SAP
                    A supplemental bond or other financial assurance, in an amount determined by BOEM, if upon reviewing your SAP, BOEM determines that a supplemental bond is required in addition to your minimum lease-specific bond, due to the complexity, number, and location of any facilities involved in your site assessment activities.
                  
                  
                    (3) Approve your COP
                    A supplemental bond or other financial assurance, in an amount determined by BOEM based on the complexity, number, and location of all facilities involved in your planned activities and commercial operation. The supplemental financial assurance requirement is in addition to your lease-specific bond and, if applicable, the previous supplement associated with SAP approval.
                  
                  
                    (4) Allow you to install facilities approved in your COP
                    A decommissioning bond or other financial assurance, in an amount determined by BOEM based on anticipated decommissioning costs. BOEM will allow you to provide your financial assurance for decommissioning in accordance with the number of facilities installed or being installed. BOEM must approve the schedule for providing the appropriate financial assurance coverage.
                  
                
                (b) Each bond or other financial assurance must guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease. You may provide a new bond or increase the amount of your existing bond, to satisfy any additional financial assurance requirements.
                (c) For hydrokinetic commercial leases, supplemental financial assurance may be required in an amount determined by BOEM before FERC issues a license.
              
              
                § 585.517
                How will BOEM determine the amounts of the supplemental and decommissioning financial assurance requirements associated with commercial leases?
                (a) BOEM will base the determination for the amounts of the SAP, COP, and decommissioning financial assurance requirements on estimates of the cost to meet all accrued lease obligations.
                (b) We determine the amount of the supplemental and decommissioning financial assurance requirements on a case-by-case basis. The amount of the financial assurance must be no less than the amount required to meet all lease obligations, including:
                (1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the Government over the next 12 months;
                (2) Any past due rent and other payments;
                (3) Other monetary obligations; and
                (4) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning, as required by subpart I of this part.
                (c) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities increase or decrease, we may adjust the amount of supplemental or the decommissioning financial assurance.
                (1) If we propose adjusting your financial assurance amount, we will notify you of the proposed adjustment and give you an opportunity to comment; and
                (2) We may approve a reduced financial assurance amount if you request it and if the reduced amount that you request continues to be greater than the sum of:
                (i) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the Government over the next 12 months;
                (ii) Any past due rent and other payments;
                (iii) Other monetary obligations; and
                (iv) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning.

                § 585.520
                What financial assurance must I provide when I obtain my limited lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant?
                (a) Before BOEM will issue your limited lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant, you or a proposed assignee must guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant by providing either:
                (1) A $300,000 minimum, lease- or grant-specific bond; or
                (2) Another approved financial assurance instrument of such minimum level as specified in §§ 585.526 through 585.529.
                (b) You meet the financial assurance requirements under this subpart if your designated lease or grant operator provides a minimum limited lease-specific or grant-specific bond in an amount sufficient to guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the limited lease or grant.
                (1) The dollar amount of the minimum, lease- or grant-specific financial assurance in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be adjusted to reflect changes in the CPI-U or a substantially equivalent index if the CPI-U is discontinued; and
                (2) The first CPI-U-based adjustment can be made no earlier than the 5-year anniversary of the adoption of this rule. Subsequent CPI-U-based adjustments may be made every 5 years thereafter.

                Do my financial assurance requirements change as activities progress on my limited lease or grant?
                (a) BOEM may require you to increase the level of your financial assurance as activities progress on your limited lease or grant. We will base the determination for the amount of financial assurance requirements on our estimate of the cost to meet all accrued lease or grant obligations, including:
                (1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the Government over the next 12 months;
                (2) Any past due rent and other payments;
                (3) Other monetary obligations; and
                (4) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning.
                (b) You may satisfy the requirement for increased financial assurance levels for the limited lease or grant by increasing the amount of your existing bond or replacing your existing bond.
                (c) BOEM will authorize you to establish a separate decommissioning bond or other financial assurance for your limited lease or grant.
                (1) The separate decommissioning bond or other financial assurance instrument must meet the requirements specified in §§ 585.525 through 585.529.
                (2) BOEM will allow you to provide your financial assurance for decommissioning in accordance with the number of facilities installed or being installed. BOEM must approve the schedule for providing the appropriate financial assurance coverage.

              Requirements for Financial Assurance Instruments
              
                § 585.525
                What general requirements must a financial assurance instrument meet?
                (a) Any bond or other acceptable financial assurance instrument that you provide must:
                (1) Be payable to BOEM upon demand; and
                (2) Guarantee compliance of all lessees, grant holders, operators, and payors with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant, any subsequent approvals and authorizations, and all applicable regulations.
                (b) All bonds and other forms of financial assurance must be on or in a form approved by BOEM. You may submit this on an approved form that you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If the document you submit omits any terms and conditions that are included on the BOEM-approved form, your bond is deemed to contain the omitted terms and conditions.

                (c) Surety bonds must be issued by an approved surety listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, as required by 31 CFR 223.16. You may obtain a copy of Circular 570 from the Treasury Web site at http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/.
                
                (d) Your surety bond cannot exceed the underwriting limit listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, except as permitted therein.
                (e) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When the surety is a corporation, an authorized corporate officer must sign the bond and attest to it over the corporate seal.
                (f) You may not terminate the period of liability of your bond or cancel your bond, except as provided in this subpart. Bonds must continue in full force and effect even though an event has occurred that could diminish or terminate a surety's obligation under State law.
                (g) Your surety must notify you and BOEM within 5 business days after:
                (1) It initiates any judicial or administrative proceeding alleging its insolvency or bankruptcy; or
                (2) The Treasury decertifies the surety.
              
              
                § 585.526
                What instruments other than a surety bond may I use to meet the financial assurance requirement?
                (a) You may use other types of security instruments, if BOEM determines that such security protects BOEM to the same extent as the surety bond. BOEM will consider pledges of the following:
                (1) U.S. Department of Treasury securities identified in 31 CFR part 225;
                (2) Cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial assurance, to be deposited and maintained in a Federal depository account of the U.S. Treasury by BOEM;
                (3) Certificates of deposit or savings accounts in a bank or financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in the United States with:
                (i) Minimum net assets of $500,000,000; and
                (ii) Minimum Bankrate.com Safe & Sound rating of 3 Stars, and Capitalization, Assets, Equity and Liquidity (CAEL) rating of 3 or less;
                (4) Negotiable U.S. Government, State, and municipal securities or bonds having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of the BOEM;
                (5) Investment-grade rated securities having a Standard and Poor's rating of AAA or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized securities rating service having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM; and
                (6) Insurance, if its form and function is such that the funding or enforceable pledges of funding are used to guarantee performance of regulatory obligations in the event of default on such obligations by the lessee. Insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “superior” or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized insurance rating service.
                (b) If you use a Treasury security:
                (1) You must post 115 percent of your financial assurance amount;

                (2) You must monitor the collateral value of your security. If the collateral value of your security as determined in accordance with the 31 CFR part 203 Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at http://www.treasurydirect.gov) falls below the required level of coverage, you must pledge additional security to provide 115 percent of the required amount; and
                (3) You must include with your pledge authority for us to sell the security and use the proceeds if we determine that you have failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of your lease or grant, any subsequent approval or authorization, or applicable regulations.
                (c) If you use the instruments described in paragraphs (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, you must provide BOEM by the end of each calendar year a certified statement describing the nature and market value of the instruments maintained in that account, and including any current statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to the lessee concerning the asset value of the account.
              
              
                
                § 585.527
                May I demonstrate financial strength and reliability to meet the financial assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?
                BOEM may allow you to use your financial strength and reliability to meet financial assurance requirements. We will make this determination based on audited financial statements, business stability, reliability, and compliance with regulations.
                (a) You must provide the following information if you want to demonstrate financial strength and reliability to meet your financial assurance requirements:
                (1) Audited financial statements (including auditor's certificate, balance sheet, and profit and loss sheet) that show you have financial capacity substantially in excess of existing and anticipated lease and other obligations;
                (2) Evidence that shows business stability based on 5 years of continuous operation and generation of renewable energy on the OCS or onshore;
                (3) Evidence that shows reliability in meeting obligations based on credit ratings or trade references, including names and addresses of other lessees, contractors, and suppliers with whom you have dealt; and
                (4) Evidence that shows a record of compliance with laws, regulations, and lease, ROW, or RUE terms.
                (b) If we approve your request to use your financial strength and reliability to meet your financial assurance requirements, you must submit annual updates to the information required by paragraph (a) of this section. You must submit this information no later than March 31 of each year.
                (c) If the annual updates to the information required by paragraph (a) of this section do not continue to demonstrate financial strength and reliability or BOEM has reason to believe that you are unable to meet the financial assurance requirements of this section, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, BOEM will terminate your ability to use financial strength and reliability for financial assurance and require you to provide another type of financial assurance. You must provide this new financial assurance instrument within 90 days after we terminate your use of financial strength and reliability.
              
              
                § 585.528
                May I use a third-party guaranty to meet the financial assurance requirement for lease or grant activities?
                (a) You may use a third-party guaranty if the guarantor meets the criteria prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and submits an agreement meeting the criteria prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must guarantee compliance with the obligations of all lessees and operators and grant holders.
                (b) BOEM will consider the following factors in deciding whether to accept an agreement:
                (1) The length of time that your guarantor has been in continuous operation as a business entity. You may exclude periods of interruption that are beyond the guarantor's control by demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Director, that the interruptions do not affect the likelihood of your guarantor remaining in business during the SAP, COP, and decommissioning stages of activities covered by the indemnity agreement.
                (2) Financial information available in the public record or submitted by your guarantor in sufficient detail to show us that your guarantor meets the criterion stated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Such detail includes:
                (i) The current rating for your guarantor's most recent bond issuance by a generally recognized bond rating service such as Moody's Investor Service or Standard and Poor's Corporation;
                (ii) Your guarantor's net worth, taking into account liabilities for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease, regulations, and other guarantees;
                (iii) Your guarantor's ratio of current assets to current liabilities, taking into account liabilities for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease, regulations, and other guarantees; and
                (iv) Your guarantor's unencumbered domestic fixed assets.

                (3) If the information in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not publicly available, your guarantor must submit the information in the following table, to be updated annually within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year (FY) or as otherwise prescribed.
                
                  
                    Your guarantor must submit . . .
                    That . . .
                  
                  
                    (i) Financial statements for the most recently completed FY
                    Include a report by an independent certified public accountant containing the accountant's audit or review opinion of the statements. The report must be prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles and contain no adverse opinion.
                  
                  
                    (ii) Financial statement for completed quarter in the current FY
                    Your guarantor's financial officer certifies to be correct.
                  
                  
                    (iii) Additional information related to bonds, if requested by the Director
                    Your guarantor's financial officer certifies to be correct.
                  
                
                (4) Your guarantor's total outstanding and proposed guarantees must not exceed 25 percent of its unencumbered domestic net worth.
                (c) Your guarantor must submit an agreement executed by the guarantor and all parties bound by the agreement. All parties are bound jointly and severally and must meet the qualifications set forth in § 585.107.
                (1) When any party is a corporation, two corporate officers authorized to execute the guaranty agreement on behalf of the corporation must sign the agreement.
                (2) When any party is a partnership, joint venture, or syndicate, the guaranty agreement must bind each party who has a beneficial interest in your guarantor and provide that, upon BOEM demand under your guaranty, each party is jointly and severally liable for compliance with all terms and conditions of your lease(s) or grant(s) covered by the agreement.
                (3) When forfeiture of the guaranty is called for, the agreement must provide that your guarantor will either bring your lease(s) or grant(s) into compliance or provide, within 7 days, sufficient funds to permit BOEM to complete corrective action.
                (4) The guaranty agreement must contain a confession of judgment, providing that, if we determine that you are, or your operator or operating rights owner is, in default, the guarantor must not challenge the determination and must remedy the default.
                (5) If you fail, or your operator or operating rights owner fails, to comply with any law, term, or regulation, your guarantor must either take corrective action or provide, within 7 days or other agreed upon time period, sufficient funds for BOEM to complete corrective action. Such compliance must not reduce your guarantor's liability.
                (6) If your guarantor wants to terminate the period of liability, your guarantor must notify you and us at least 90 days before the proposed termination date, obtain our approval for termination of all or a specified portion of the guarantee for liabilities arising after that date, and remain liable for all your work performed during the period the agreement is in effect.
                (7) Each guaranty submitted pursuant to this section is deemed to contain all the above terms, even if they are not actually in the agreement.
                (d) Before the termination of your guaranty, you must provide an acceptable replacement in the form of a bond or other security.
              
              
                § 585.529
                Can I use a lease- or grant-specific decommissioning account to meet the financial assurance requirements related to decommissioning?
                (a) In lieu of a surety bond, BOEM may authorize you to establish a lease-, ROW grant-, or RUE grant-specific decommissioning account in a federally-insured institution. The funds may not be withdrawn from the account without our written approval.
                (1) The funds must be payable to BOEM and pledged to meet your lease or grant decommissioning and site clearance obligations; and
                (2) You must fully fund the account within the time BOEM prescribes to cover all costs of decommissioning including site clearance. BOEM will estimate the cost of decommissioning, including site clearance.

                (b) Any interest paid on the account will be treated as account funds unless we authorize in writing that any interest be paid to the depositor.

                (c) We may allow you to pledge Treasury securities, payable to BOEM on demand, to satisfy your obligation to make payments into the account. Acceptable Treasury securities and their collateral value are determined in accordance with 31 CFR part 203, Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at http://www.treasurydirect.gov).
                (d) We may require you to commit a specified stream of revenues as payment into the account so that the account will be fully funded, as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The commitment may include revenue from other operations.
              
            
            
              Changes in Financial Assurance
              
                § 585.530
                What must I do if my financial assurance lapses?
                (a) If your surety is decertified by the Treasury, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or if your surety's charter or license is suspended or revoked, or if any other approved financial assurance expires for any reason, you must:
                (1) Inform BOEM within 3 business days about the financial assurance lapse; and
                (2) Provide new financial assurance in the amount set by BOEM, as provided in this subpart.
                (b) You must notify BOEM within 3 business days after you learn of any action filed alleging that you, your surety, or third-party guarantor, is insolvent or bankrupt.
              
              
                § 585.531
                What happens if the value of my financial assurance is reduced?
                If the value of your financial assurance is reduced below the required financial assurance amount because of a default or any other reason, you must provide additional financial assurance sufficient to meet the requirements of this subpart within 45 days or within a different period as specified by BOEM.
              
              
                § 585.532
                What happens if my surety wants to terminate the period of liability of my bond?
                (a) Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during which surety liability continues to accrue. The surety continues to be responsible for obligations and liabilities that accrued during the period of liability and before the date on which BOEM terminates the period of liability under paragraph (b) of this section. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include:
                (1) Obligations that started to accrue before the beginning of the period of liability and have not been met; and
                (2) Obligations that began accruing during the period of liability.
                (b) Your surety must submit to BOEM its request to terminate the period of liability under its bond and notify you of that request. If you intend to continue activities, or have not met all obligations of your lease or grant, you must provide a replacement bond or alternative form of financial assurance of equivalent or greater value. BOEM will terminate that period of liability within 90 days after BOEM receives the request.
              
              
                § 585.533
                How does my surety obtain cancellation of my bond?
                (a) BOEM will release a bond or allow a surety to cancel a bond, and will relieve the surety from accrued obligations only if:
                (1) BOEM determines that there are no outstanding obligations covered by the bond; or
                (2) The following occurs:
                (i) BOEM accepts a replacement bond or an alternative form of financial assurance in an amount equal to or greater than the bond to be cancelled to cover the terminated period of liability;
                (ii) The surety issuing the new bond has expressly agreed to assume all outstanding liabilities under the original bond that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and
                (iii) The surety issuing the new bond has agreed to assume that portion of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the terminated period of liability that exceeds the coverage of the bond prescribed under §§ 585.515, 585.516, 585.520, or 585.521, and of which you were notified.
                (b) When your lease or grant ends, your surety(ies) remain(s) responsible, and BOEM will retain any financial assurance as follows:

                (1) The period of liability ends when you cease all operations and activities under the lease or grant, including decommissioning and site clearance;
                (2) Your surety or collateral financial assurance will not be released until 7 years after the lease ends, or a longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bonded obligation, or for BOEM to determine that all of your obligations under the lease or grant have been satisfied; and
                (3) BOEM will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your financial assurance if we determine that we need less than the full amount of the bond or financial assurance to meet any possible future obligations.
              
              
                § 585.534
                When may BOEM cancel my bond?
                When your lease or grant ends, your surety(ies) remain(s) responsible, and BOEM will retain any pledged security as shown in the following table:

                    (a) Bonds for commercial leases submitted under § 585.515
                    When BOEM determines that you have met all of your obligations under the lease
                    Seven years after the lease ends, or a longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bond obligation. BOEM will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your security if BOEM determines that you need less than the full amount of the bond to meet any possible future obligations.
                  
                  
                    (b) Supplemental or decommissioning bonds submitted under § 585.516
                    When BOEM determines that you have met all your decommissioning, site clearance, and other obligations
                    (1) Seven years after the lease ends, or a longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bond obligation. BOEM will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your security if BOEM determines that you need less than the full amount of the bond to meet any possible future obligations; and
                  
                  
                     
                    
                    (2) BOEM determines that the potential liability resulting from any undetected noncompliance is not greater than the amount of the lease base bond.
                  
                  
                    (c) Bonds submitted under §§ 585.520 and 585.521 for limited leases, ROW grants, or RUE grants
                    When BOEM determines that you have met all of your obligations under the limited lease or grant
                    Seven years after the limited lease, ROW, or RUE grant or a longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bond obligation. BOEM will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your security if BOEM determines that you need less than the full amount of the bond to meet any possible future obligations.
                  
                
              
              
                § 585.535
                Why might BOEM call for forfeiture of my bond?
                (a) BOEM may call for forfeiture of all or part of the bond, pledged security, or other form of guaranty if:
                (1) After notice and demand for performance by BOEM, you refuse or fail, within the timeframe we prescribe, to comply with any term or condition of your lease or grant, other authorization or approval, or applicable regulations; or
                (2) You default on one of the conditions under which we accepted your bond.
                (b) We may pursue forfeiture without first making demands for performance against any co-lessee or holder of an interest in your ROW or RUE, or other person approved to perform obligations under your lease or grant.
              
              
                § 585.536
                How will I be notified of a call for forfeiture?

                (a) BOEM will notify you and your surety, including any provider of financial assurance, in writing of the call for forfeiture and provide the reasons for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited. We will base the amount upon an estimate of the total cost of corrective action to bring your lease or grant into compliance.
                (b) We will advise you and your surety that you may avoid forfeiture if, within 10 business days:
                (1) You agree to and demonstrate in writing to BOEM that you will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, and you do so; or
                (2) Your surety agrees to and demonstrates that it will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the face amount of the bond.

                How will BOEM proceed once my bond or other security is forfeited?
                (a) If BOEM determines that your bond or other security is forfeited, we will collect the forfeited amount and use the funds to bring your lease or grant(s) into compliance and correct any default.
                (b) If the amount collected under your bond or other security is insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective action, BOEM may take or direct action to obtain full compliance and recover all costs in excess of the forfeited bond from you or any co-lessee or co-grantee.
                (c) If the amount collected under your bond or other security exceeds the full cost of corrective action to bring your lease or grant(s) into compliance, we will return the excess funds to the party from whom the excess was collected.

              Revenue Sharing With States
              
                § 585.540
                How will BOEM equitably distribute revenues to States?
                (a) BOEM will distribute among the eligible coastal States 27 percent of the following revenues derived from qualified projects, where a qualified project and qualified project area is determined in § 585.541 and an eligible State is determined in § 585.542, with each term defined in § 585.112. Revenues subject to distribution to eligible States include all bonuses, acquisition fees, rentals, and operating fees derived from the entire qualified project area and associated project easements not limited to revenues attributable to the portion of the project area within 3 miles of the seaward boundary of a coastal State. The revenues to be shared do not include administrative fees such as service fees and those assessed for civil penalties and forfeiture of bond or other surety obligations.
                (b) The project area is the area included within a single lease or grant. For each qualified project, BOEM will determine and announce the project area and its geographic center at the time it grants or issues a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the OCS. If a qualified project lease or grant's boundaries change significantly due to actions pursuant to §§ 585.435 or 585.436, BOEM will re-evaluate the project area to determine whether the geographic center has changed. If it has, BOEM will re-determine State eligibility and shares accordingly.

                (c) To determine each eligible State's share of the 27 percent of the revenues for a qualified project, BOEM will use the inverse distance formula, which apportions shares according to the relative proximity of the nearest point on the coastline of each eligible State to the geographic center of the qualified project area. If Si is equal to the nearest distance from the geographic center of the project area to the i = 1, 2, * * * nth eligible State's coastline, then eligible State i would be entitled to the fraction Fi of the 27-percent aggregate revenue share due to all the eligible States according to the formula:
                
                Fi= (1/Si) ÷ (Σi=1* * *n(1/Si)).
              
              
                § 585.541
                What is a qualified project for revenue sharing purposes?
                A qualified project for the purpose of revenue sharing with eligible coastal States is one authorized under subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act, which includes acreage within the area extending 3 nautical miles seaward of State submerged lands. A qualified project is subject to revenue sharing with those States that are eligible for revenue sharing under § 585.542. The entire area within a lease or grant for the qualified project, excluding project easements, is considered the qualified project area.
              
              
                
                § 585.542
                What makes a State eligible for payment of revenues?
                A State is eligible for payment of revenues if any part of the State's coastline is located within 15 miles of the announced geographic center of the project area of a qualified project. A State is not eligible for revenue sharing if all parts of that State's coastline are more than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified project area. This is the case even if the qualified project area is located wholly or partially within an area extending 3 nautical miles seaward of the submerged lands of that State or if there are no States with a coastline less than 15 miles from the announced geographic center of the qualified project area.
              
              
                § 585.543
                Example of how the inverse distance formula works.
                (a) Assume that the geographic center of the project area lies 12 miles from the closest coastline point of State A and 4 miles from the closest coastline point of State B. BOEM will round dollar shares to the nearest whole dollar. The proportional share due each State would be calculated as follows:
                (1) State A's share = [(1/12) ÷ (1/12 + 1/4)] = 1/4.
                (2) State B's share = [(1/4) ÷ (1/12 + 1/4)] = 3/4.
                (b) Therefore, State B would receive a share of revenues that is three times as large as that awarded to State A, based on the finding that State B's nearest coastline is one-third the distance to the geographic center of the qualified project area as compared to State A's nearest coastline. Eligible States share the 27 percent of the total revenues from the qualified project as mandated under the OCS Lands Act. Hence, if the qualified project generates $1,000,000 of Federal revenues in a given year, the Federal Government would distribute the States' 27-percent share as follows:
                (1) State A's share = $270,000 × 1/4 = $67,500.
                (2) State B's share = $270,000 × 3/4 = $202,500.

                § 585.617
                What activities require a revision to my SAP, and when will BOEM approve the revision?
                (a) You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved SAP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing SAP or require a revision to your SAP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.
                (b) BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved SAP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your SAP. If the review indicates that the SAP should be revised to meet the requirements of this part, we will require you to submit the needed revisions.
                (c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your SAP will likely be necessary include:
                (1) Activities not described in your approved SAP;
                (2) Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;
                (3) Changes in the surface location of a facility or structure;
                (4) Addition of a facility or structure not contemplated in your approved SAP;
                (5) Changes in the location of your onshore support base from one State to another, or to a new base requiring expansion;

                (6) Changes in the location of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains, etc.) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations. If a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision;
                (7) Structural failure of one or more facilities; or

                (8) Changes to any other activity specified by BOEM.
                
                (d) We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and other relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:
                (1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;
                (2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or
                (3) Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.
                (e) When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:
                (1) Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and
                (2) Otherwise consistent with the provisions of subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act.

                (b) You must submit a certification of compliance annually (or other frequency as determined by BOEM) with certain terms and conditions of your COP that BOEM identifies. Together with your certification, you must submit:
                (1) Summary reports that show compliance with the terms and conditions which require certification; and
                (2) A statement identifying and describing any mitigation measures and monitoring methods, and their effectiveness. If you identified measures that were not effective, then you must make recommendations for new mitigation measures or monitoring methods.
                (c) As provided at § 585.105(i), BOEM may require you to submit any supporting data and information.
              
              
                § 585.634
                What activities require a revision to my COP, and when will BOEM approve the revision?
                (a) You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved COP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing COP or require a revision to your COP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.
                (b) BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved COP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information, and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your COP. If the review indicates that the COP should be revised to meet the requirement of this part, we will require you to submit the needed revisions.
                (c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your COP will likely be necessary include:
                (1) Activities not described in your approved COP;
                (2) Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;
                (3) Change in the surface location of a facility or structure;
                (4) Addition of a facility or structure not described in your approved COP;
                (5) Change in the location of your onshore support base from one State to another or to a new base requiring expansion;

                (6) Changes in the location of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains, etc.) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations (e.g., if a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision);
                (7) Structural failure of one or more facilities; or
                (8) Change in any other activity specified by BOEM.
                (d) We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:
                (1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;
                (2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or
                (3) Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.
                (e) When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:
                (1) Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and
                (2) Otherwise consistent with the provisions of subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act.

              Activities Under an Approved GAP
              
                § 585.650
                When may I begin conducting activities under my GAP?
                After BOEM approves your GAP, you may begin conducting the approved activities that do not involve a project easement or the construction of facilities on the OCS that BOEM has deemed to be complex or significant.
              
              
                § 585.651
                When may I construct complex or significant OCS facilities on my limited lease or any facilities on my project easement proposed under my GAP?
                If you are applying for a project easement, or installing a facility or a combination of facilities on your limited lease deemed by BOEM to be complex or significant, as provided in § 585.648(a)(1), you also must comply with the requirements of subpart G of this part and submit your Safety Management System description required by § 585.810 before construction may begin.
              
              
                § 585.652
                How long do I have to conduct activities under an approved GAP?
                After BOEM approves your GAP, you have:
                (a) For a limited lease, 5 years to conduct your approved activities, unless we renew the term under §§ 585.425 through 585.429.
                (b) For a ROW grant or RUE grant, the time provided in the terms of the grant.
              
              
                § 585.653
                What other reports or notices must I submit to BOEM under my approved GAP?
                (a) You must notify BOEM in writing within 30 days after completing installation activities approved in your GAP.
                (b) You must prepare and submit to BOEM annually a report that summarizes the findings from any activities you conduct under your approved GAP and the results of those activities. We will protect the information from public disclosure as provided in § 585.113.

                (c) You must annually (or other frequency as determined by BOEM) submit a certification of compliance with those terms and conditions of your GAP that BOEM identifies under § 585.648(e)(1). Together with your certification, you must submit:
                (1) Summary reports that show compliance with the terms and conditions which require certification; and
                (2) A statement identifying and describing any mitigation measures and monitoring methods and their effectiveness.

                § 585.655
                What activities require a revision to my GAP, and when will BOEM approve the revision?
                (a) You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved GAP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing GAP or require a revision to your GAP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.
                (b) BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved GAP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your GAP. If the review indicates that the GAP should be revised to meet the requirement of this part, we will require you to submit the needed revisions.
                (c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your GAP will likely be necessary include:
                (1) Activities not described in your approved GAP;
                (2) Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;
                (3) Change in the surface location of a facility or structure;
                (4) Addition of a facility or structure not contemplated in your approved GAP;
                (5) Change in the location of your onshore support base from one State to another or to a new base requiring expansion;

                (6) Changes in the locations of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains, etc.) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations. If a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision;
                (7) Structural failure of one or more facilities; or
                (8) Change to any other activity specified by BOEM.
                (d) We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and any relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:
                (1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;
                (2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or
                (3) Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.
                (e) When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:
                (1) Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and
                (2) Otherwise consistent with the provisions of subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act.
              
              
                § 585.656
                What must I do if I cease activities approved in my GAP before the end of my term?
                You must notify the BOEM any time you cease activities under your approved GAP without an approved suspension. If you cease activities for an indefinite period that exceeds 6 months, BOEM may cancel your lease or grant under § 585.437, as applicable, and you must initiate the decommissioning process, as set forth in subpart I of this part.
              
              
                § 585.657

              Cable and Pipeline Deviations
              
                § 585.658
                Can my cable or pipeline construction deviate from my approved COP or GAP?
                (a) You must make every effort to ensure that all cables and pipelines are constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the approved plan under your lease or grant.
                (b) If BOEM determines that a significant change in conditions has occurred that would necessitate an adjustment to your ROW, RUE or lease before the commencement of construction of the cable or pipeline on the grant or lease, BOEM will consider modifications to your ROW grant, RUE grant, or your lease addendum for a project easement in connection with your COP or GAP.
                (c) If, after construction, it is determined that a deviation from the approved plan has occurred, you must:
                (1) Notify the operators of all leases (including mineral leases issued under this subchapter) and holders of all ROW grants or RUE grants (including all grants issued under this subchapter) which include the area where a deviation has occurred and provide BOEM with evidence of such notification;
                (2) Relinquish any unused portion of your lease or grant; and
                (3) Submit a revised plan for BOEM approval as necessary.
                (d) Construction of a cable or pipeline that substantially deviates from the approved plan may be grounds for cancellation of the lease or grant.

            Subpart I—Decommissioning
            
              Decommissioning Obligations and Requirements
              
                § 585.900
                Who must meet the decommissioning obligations in this subpart?
                (a) Lessees are jointly and severally responsible for meeting decommissioning obligations for facilities on their leases, including all obstructions, as the obligations accrue and until each obligation is met.
                (b) Grant holders are jointly and severally liable for meeting decommissioning obligations for facilities on their grant, including all obstructions, as the obligations accrue and until each obligation is met.
              
              
                § 585.901
                When do I accrue decommissioning obligations?
                You accrue decommissioning obligations when you are or become a lessee or grant holder, and you either install, construct, or acquire by a BOEM-approved assignment a facility, cable, or pipeline, or you create an obstruction to other uses of the OCS.
              
              
                § 585.902
                What are the general requirements for decommissioning for facilities authorized under my SAP, COP, or GAP?
                (a) Except as otherwise authorized by BOEM under § 585.909, within 2 years following termination of a lease or grant, you must:
                (1) Remove or decommission all facilities, projects, cables, pipelines, and obstructions;
                (2) Clear the seafloor of all obstructions created by activities on your lease, including your project easement, or grant, as required by the BOEM.
                (b) Before decommissioning the facilities under your SAP, COP, or GAP, you must submit a decommissioning application and receive approval from the BOEM.
                (c) The approval of the decommissioning concept in the SAP, COP, or GAP is not an approval of a decommissioning application. However, you may submit your complete decommissioning application simultaneously with the SAP, COP, or GAP so that it may undergo appropriate technical and regulatory reviews at that time.
                (d) Following approval of your decommissioning application, you must submit a decommissioning notice under § 585.908 to BOEM at least 60 days before commencing decommissioning activities.
                (e) If you, your subcontractors, or any agent acting on your behalf discover any archaeological resource while conducting decommissioning activities, you must immediately halt bottom-disturbing activities within 1,000 feet of the discovery and report the discovery to us within 72 hours. We will inform you how to conduct investigations to determine if the resource is significant and how to protect it. You, your subcontractors, or any agent acting on your behalf must keep the location of the discovery confidential and must not take any action that may adversely affect the archaeological resource until we have made an evaluation and told you how to proceed.
                (f) Provide BOEM with documentation of any coordination efforts you have made with the affected States, local, and Tribal governments.
              
              
                
                § 585.903
                What are the requirements for decommissioning FERC-licensed hydrokinetic facilities?
                You must comply with the decommissioning requirements in your BOEM-issued lease. If you fail to comply with the decommissioning requirements of your lease then:
                (a) BOEM may call for the forfeiture of your bond or other financial assurance;
                (b) You remain liable for removal or disposal costs and responsible for accidents or damages that might result from such failure; and
                (c) BOEM may take enforcement action under § 585.400 of this part.
              
              
                § 585.904
                Can I request a departure from the decommissioning requirements?
                You may request a departure from the decommissioning requirements under § 585.103.

                (a) Based upon your inclusion of all the information required by § 585.906, BOEM will compare your decommissioning application with the decommissioning general concept in your approved SAP, COP, or GAP to determine what technical and environmental reviews are needed.

                (b) You will likely have to revise your SAP, COP, or GAP, and BOEM will begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and other regulatory reviews as required, if BOEM determines that your decommissioning application would:
                (1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated in your SAP, COP, or GAP;
                (2) Require any additional Federal permits; or
                (3) Propose activities not previously identified and evaluated in your SAP, COP, or GAP.
                (c) During the review process, we may request additional information if we determine that the information provided is not sufficient to complete the review and approval process.
                (d) Upon completion of the technical and environmental reviews, we may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove your decommissioning application.
                (e) If BOEM disapproves your decommissioning application, you must resubmit your application to address the concerns identified by BOEM.
              
              
                § 585.908
                What must I include in my decommissioning notice?
                (a) The decommissioning notice is distinct from your decommissioning application and may only be submitted following approval of your decommissioning application, as described in §§ 585.905 through 585.907. You must submit a decommissioning notice at least 60 days before you plan to begin decommissioning activities.

                (1) Ensures safety and minimizes adverse effects to the coastal and marine environments, including their physical, atmospheric, and biological components, to the extent practicable;
                (2) Does not inhibit or restrain orderly development of OCS mineral or energy resources; and
                (3) Avoids serious harm or damage to, or waste of, any natural resource (including OCS mineral deposits and oil, gas, and sulphur resources in areas leased or not leased), any life (including fish and other aquatic life), or property (including sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance);
                (4) Is otherwise consistent with subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act; and
                (5) BOEM can effectively regulate.
                (b) Based on the evaluation that we perform under paragraph (a) of this section, the BOEM may authorize or reject, or authorize with modifications or stipulations, the proposed activity.
              
              
                § 585.1007
                What process will BOEM use for competitively offering an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) An Alternate Use RUE must be issued on a competitive basis unless BOEM determines, after public notice of the proposed Alternate Use RUE, that there is no competitive interest.
                (b) We will issue a public notice in the Federal Register to determine if there is competitive interest in using the proposed facility for alternate use activities. BOEM will specify a time period for members of the public to express competitive interest.
                (c) If we receive indications of competitive interest within the published timeframe, we will proceed with a competitive offering. As part of such competitive offering, each competing applicant must submit a description of the types of activities proposed for the existing facility, as well as satisfactory evidence that the competing applicant qualifies to hold a lease or grant on the OCS, as required in §§ 585.106 and 585.107, by a date we specify. We may request additional information from competing applicants, as necessary, to adequately evaluate the competing proposals.
                (d) We will evaluate all competing proposals to determine whether:
                (1) The proposed activities are compatible with existing activities at the facility; and
                (2) We have the expertise and resources available to regulate the activities effectively.
                (e) We will evaluate all proposals under the requirements of NEPA, CZMA, and other applicable laws.

                (f) Following our evaluation, we will select one or more acceptable proposals for activities involving the alternate use of an existing OCS facility, notify the competing applicants, and submit each acceptable proposal to the lessee and owner of the existing OCS facility. If the lessee and owner of the facility agree to accept a proposal, we will proceed to issue an Alternate Use RUE. If the lessee and owner of the facility are unwilling to accept any of the proposals that we deem acceptable, we will not issue an Alternate Use RUE.

                § 585.1010
                How long may I conduct activities under an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) We will establish on a case-by-case basis, and set forth in the Alternate Use RUE, the length of time for which you are authorized to conduct activities approved in your Alternate Use RUE instrument.
                (b) In establishing this term, BOEM will consider the size and scale of the proposed alternate use activities, the type of alternate use activities, and any other relevant considerations.
                (c) BOEM may authorize renewal of Alternate Use RUEs at its discretion.
              
              
                § 585.1011
                What payments are required for an Alternate Use RUE?
                We will establish rental or other payments for an Alternate Use RUE on a case-by-case basis, as set forth in the Alternate Use RUE grant, depending on our assessment of the following factors:
                (a) The effect on the original OCS Lands Act approved activity;
                (b) The size and scale of the proposed alternate use activities;
                (c) The income, if any, expected to be generated from the proposed alternate use activities; and
                (d) The type of alternate use activities.
              
              
                § 585.1012
                What financial assurance is required for an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) The holder of an Alternate Use RUE will be required to secure financial assurances in an amount determined by BOEM that is sufficient to cover all obligations under the Alternate Use RUE, including decommissioning obligations, and must retain such financial assurance amounts until all obligations have been fulfilled, as determined by BOEM.
                (b) We may revise financial assurance amounts, as necessary, to ensure that there is sufficient financial assurance to secure all obligations under the Alternate Use RUE.
                (c) We may reduce the amount of the financial assurance that you must retain if it is not necessary to cover existing obligations under the Alternate Use RUE.
              
              
                § 585.1013
                Is an Alternate Use RUE assignable?
                (a) BOEM may authorize assignment of an Alternate Use RUE.
                (b) To request assignment of an Alternate Use RUE, you must submit a written request for assignment that includes the following information:
                (1) BOEM-assigned Alternate Use RUE number;
                (2) The names of both the assignor and the assignee, if applicable;
                (3) The names and telephone numbers of the contacts for both the assignor and the assignee;
                (4) The names, titles, and signatures of the authorizing officials for both the assignor and the assignee;
                (5) A statement affirming that the owner of the existing OCS facility and lessee of the lease in which the facility is located approve of the proposed assignment and assignee;
                (6) A statement that the assignee agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Alternate Use RUE;
                (7) Evidence required by § 585.107 that the assignee satisfies the requirements of § 585.106; and
                (8) A statement on how the assignee will comply with the financial assurance requirements set forth in the Alternate Use RUE.
                (c) The assignment takes effect on the date we approve your request.
                (d) The assignor is liable for all obligations that accrue under an Alternate Use RUE before the date we approve your assignment request. An assignment approval by BOEM does not relieve the assignor of liability for accrued obligations that the assignee, or a subsequent assignee, fails to perform.
                (e) The assignee and each subsequent assignee are liable for all obligations that accrue under an Alternate Use RUE after the date we approve the assignment request.
              
              
                
                § 585.1014
                When will BOEM suspend an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) BOEM may suspend an Alternate Use RUE if:
                (1) Necessary to comply with judicial decrees;
                (2) Continued activities pursuant to the Alternate Use RUE pose an imminent threat of serious or irreparable harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance;
                (3) The suspension is necessary for reasons of National security or defense; or
                (4) We have suspended or temporarily prohibited operation of the existing OCS facility that is subject to the Alternate Use RUE, and have determined that continued activities under the Alternate Use RUE are unsafe or cause undue interference with the operation of the original OCS Lands Act approved activity.
                (b) A suspension will extend the term of your Alternate Use RUE grant for the period of the suspension.
              
              
                § 585.1015
                How do I relinquish an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) You may voluntarily surrender an Alternate Use RUE by submitting a written request to us that includes the following:
                (1) The name, address, e-mail address, and phone number of an authorized representative;
                (2) The reason you are requesting relinquishment of the Alternate Use RUE;
                (3) BOEM-assigned Alternate Use RUE number;
                (4) The name of the associated OCS facility, its owner, and the lessee for the lease in which the OCS facility is located;

                (6) A statement that you will adhere to the decommissioning requirements in the Alternate Use RUE.
                (b) We will not approve your relinquishment request until you have paid all outstanding rentals (or other payments) and fines.
                (c) The relinquishment takes effect on the date we approve your request.
              
              
                § 585.1016
                When will an Alternate Use RUE be cancelled?
                The Secretary may cancel an Alternate Use RUE if it is determined, after notice and opportunity to be heard:
                (a) You no longer qualify to hold an Alternate Use RUE;
                (b) You failed to provide any additional financial assurance required by BOEM, replace or provide additional coverage for a de-valued bond, or replace a lapsed or forfeited bond within the prescribed time period;
                (c) Continued activity under the Alternate Use RUE is likely to cause serious harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance;
                (d) Continued activity under the Alternate Use RUE is determined to be adversely impacting the original OCS Lands Act approved activities on the existing OCS facility;
                (e) You failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of your approved Alternate Use RUE or your approved plan; or
                (f) You otherwise failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations.

              Decommissioning an Alternate Use RUE
              
                § 585.1018
                Who is responsible for decommissioning an OCS facility subject to an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) The holder of an Alternate Use RUE is responsible for all decommissioning obligations that accrue following the issuance of the Alternate Use RUE and which pertain to the Alternate Use RUE.

                (b) The lessee under the lease originally issued under 30 CFR part 250 will remain responsible for decommissioning obligations that accrued before issuance of the Alternate Use RUE, as well as for decommissioning obligations that accrue following issuance of the Alternate Use RUE to the extent associated with continued activities authorized under other parts of this title.
              
              
                § 585.1019
                What are the decommissioning requirements for an Alternate Use RUE?
                (a) Decommissioning requirements will be determined by BOEM on a case-by-case basis, and will be included in the terms of each Alternate Use RUE.
                (b) Decommissioning activities must be completed within 1 year of termination of the Alternate Use RUE.
                (c) If you fail to satisfy all decommissioning requirements within the prescribed time period, we will call for the forfeiture of your bond or other financial guarantee, and you will remain liable for all accidents or damages that might result from such failure.

              § 590.1
              What is the purpose of this subpart?
              The purpose of this subpart is to explain the procedures for appeals of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) decisions and orders issued under subchapter C.
            
            
              § 590.2
              Who may appeal?
              If you are adversely affected by an OMM official's final decision or order issued under 30 CFR chapter V, subchapter C, you may appeal that decision or order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA). Your appeal must conform with the procedures found in this subpart and 43 CFR part 4, subpart E. A request for reconsideration of a BOEM decision concerning a lease bid, authorized in 30 CFR parts 556.47(e)(3), 581.21(a)(1), or 585.118(c), is not subject to the procedures found in this part.
            
            
              § 590.3
              What is the time limit for filing an appeal?
              You must file your appeal within 60 days after you receive OMM's final decision or order. The 60-day time period applies rather than the time period provided in 43 CFR 4.411(a). A decision or order is received on the date you sign a receipt confirming delivery or, if there is no receipt, the date otherwise documented.
            
            
              § 590.4
              How do I file an appeal?
              For your appeal to be filed, BOEM must receive all of the following within 60 days after you receive the decision or order:
              (a) A written Notice of Appeal together with a copy of the decision or order you are appealing in the office of the OEMM officer that issued the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and
              (b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of Appeal.
              (1) You must pay electronically through the Fees for Services page on the BOEM Web site at http://www.boem.gov, and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page with your Notice of Appeal.
              (2) You cannot extend the 60-day period for payment of the processing fee.

              § 590.5
              Can I obtain an extension for filing my Notice of Appeal?
              You cannot obtain an extension of time to file the Notice of Appeal. See 43 CFR 4.411(c).
            
            
              § 590.6
              Are informal resolutions permitted?
              (a) You may seek informal resolution with the issuing officer's next level supervisor during the 60-day period established in § 590.3.
              (b) Nothing in this subpart precludes resolution by settlement of any appeal or matter pending in the administrative process after the 60-day period established in § 590.3.
            
            
              
              § 590.7
              Do I have to comply with the decision or order while my appeal is pending?
              (a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for filing an appeal under § 590.3 unless:
              (1) OMM notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any mineral deposit, or property; or
              (2) You post a surety bond under 30 CFR 550.1409 pending the appeal challenging an order to pay a civil penalty.
              (b) This section applies rather than 43 CFR 4.21(a) for appeals of OMM orders.
              (c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or order under appeal.
            
            
              § 590.8
              How do I exhaust my administrative remedies?
              (a) If you receive a decision or order issued under chapter V, subchapter C, you must appeal that decision or order to IBLA under 43 CFR part 4, subpart E, to exhaust administrative remedies.
              (b) This section does not apply if the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management or the IBLA makes a decision or order immediately effective notwithstanding an appeal.
