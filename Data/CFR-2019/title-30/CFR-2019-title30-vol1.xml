      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part establishes a system under which MSHA charges a fee for services provided. This part includes the management and calculation of fees for the approval program, which includes: Application processing, testing and evaluation, approval decisions, post-approval activities, and termination of approvals.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 5.30</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fee calculation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Fee calculation.</E> MSHA charges a fee based on an hourly rate for Approval and Certification Center (A&amp;CC) approval program activities and other associated costs, such as travel expenses and part 15 fees. Part 15 fees for services provided to MSHA by other organizations may be set by those organizations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Hourly rate calculation.</E> The hourly rate consists of direct and indirect costs of the A&amp;CC's approval program divided by the number of direct hours worked on all approval program activities.</P>
            <P>(1) Direct costs are compensation and benefit costs for hours worked on approval program activities.</P>
            <P>(2) Indirect costs are a proportionate share of the following A&amp;CC costs:</P>
            <P>(i) Compensation and benefit hours worked in support of all A&amp;CC activities;</P>
            <P>(ii) A&amp;CC building and equipment depreciation costs;</P>
            <P>(iii) A&amp;CC utilities, facility and equipment maintenance, and supplies and materials; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Information Technology and other services the Department of Labor provides to the A&amp;CC.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees are charged for</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) Application processing (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, administrative and technical review of applications, computer tracking, and status reporting);</P>
            <P>(2) Testing and evaluation (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, analysis of drawings, technical evaluation, testing, test set up and test tear down, and internal quality control activities);</P>
            <P>(3) Approval decisions (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, consultation on applications, records control and security, document preparation); and</P>
            <P>(4) Two post-approval activities: changes to approvals and post-approval product audits.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees are not charged for</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) Technical assistance not related to processing an approval application;</P>
            <P>(2) Technical programs, including development of new technology programs;</P>
            <P>(3) Participation in research conducted by other government agencies or private organizations; and</P>
            <P>(4) Regulatory review activities, including participation in the development of health and safety standards, regulations, and legislation.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Fee estimate.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, on completion of an initial administrative review of the application, the A&amp;CC will prepare a maximum fee estimate for each application. A&amp;CC will begin the technical evaluation after the applicant authorizes the fee estimate.</P>
            <P>(1) The applicant may pre-authorize an expenditure for services, and may further choose to pre-authorize either a maximum dollar amount or an expenditure without a specified maximum amount.</P>

            <P>(i) All applications containing a pre-authorization statement will be put in the queue for the technical evaluation on completion of an initial administrative review.<PRTPAGE P="12"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) MSHA will concurrently prepare a maximum fee estimate for applications containing a statement pre-authorizing a maximum dollar amount, and will provide the applicant with this estimate.</P>
            <P>(2) Where MSHA's estimated maximum fee exceeds the pre-authorized maximum dollar amount, the applicant has the choice of cancelling the action and paying for all work done up to the time of the cancellation, or authorizing MSHA's estimate.</P>
            <P>(3) Under the Revised Acceptance Modification Program (RAMP), MSHA expedites applications for acceptance of minor changes to previously approved, certified, accepted, or evaluated products. The applicant must pre-authorize a fixed dollar amount, set by MSHA, for processing the application.</P>
            <P>(f) If unforeseen circumstances are discovered during the evaluation, and MSHA determines that these circumstances would result in the actual costs exceeding either the pre-authorized expenditure or the authorized maximum fee estimate, as appropriate, MSHA will prepare a revised maximum fee estimate for completing the evaluation. The applicant will have the option of either cancelling the action and paying for services rendered or authorizing MSHA's revised estimate, in which case MSHA will continue to test and evaluate the product.</P>
            <P>(g) If the actual cost of processing the application is less than MSHA's maximum fee estimate, MSHA will charge the actual cost.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and effective date.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part sets out alternate requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves for use in gassy underground mines. It permits manufacturers of certain products who seek MSHA approval to use an independent laboratory to perform, in whole or part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval. It also permits manufacturers to have their products approved based on non-MSHA product safety standards once MSHA has determined that the non-MSHA standards are equivalent to MSHA's applicable product approval requirements or can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements. The provisions of this part may be used by applicants for product approval under parts 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35, and 36. This rule is effective August 18, 2003.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Use of independent laboratories.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) MSHA will accept testing and evaluation performed by an independent laboratory for purposes of MSHA product approval provided that MSHA receives as part of the application:</P>
            <P>(1) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;</P>
            <P>(2) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;</P>
            <P>(3) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and</P>
            <P>(4) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by the applicable part under this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) Product testing and evaluation performed by independent laboratories for purposes of MSHA approval must comply with the applicable MSHA product approval requirements.</P>
            <P>(c) Product testing and evaluation must be conducted or witnessed by the laboratory's personnel.</P>
            <P>(d) After review of the information required under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, MSHA will notify the applicant if additional information or testing is required. The applicant must provide this information, arrange any additional or repeat tests and notify MSHA of the location, date, and time of the test(s). MSHA may observe any additional testing conducted by an independent laboratory. Further, MSHA may decide to conduct the additional or repeated tests at the applicant's expense. The applicant must supply any additional components necessary for testing and evaluation.</P>
            <P>(e) Upon request by MSHA, but not more than once a year, except for cause, approval holders of products approved based on independent laboratory testing and evaluation must make such products available for post-approval audit at a mutually agreeable site at no cost to MSHA.</P>
            <P>(f) Once the product is approved, the approval holder must notify MSHA of all product defects of which they become aware.</P>

            <SUBJECT>MSHA acceptance of equivalent non-MSHA product safety standards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) MSHA will accept non-MSHA product safety standards, or groups of standards, as equivalent after determining that they:</P>

            <P>(1) Provide at least the same degree of protection as MSHA's product approval requirements in parts 14, 18, 19, 20, 33, 35 and 36 of this chapter; or<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements.</P>

            <P>(b) MSHA will publish its intent to review any non-MSHA product safety standard for equivalency in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for the purpose of soliciting public input.</P>
            <P>(c) A listing of all equivalency determinations will be published in this part 6 and the applicable approval parts. The listing will state whether MSHA accepts the non-MSHA product safety standards in their original form, or whether MSHA will require modifications to demonstrate equivalency. If modifications are required, they will be provided in the listing. MSHA will notify the public of each equivalency determination and will publish a summary of the basis for its determination. MSHA will provide equivalency determination reports to the public upon request to the Approval and Certification Center.</P>
            <P>(d) After MSHA has determined that non-MSHA product safety standards are equivalent and has notified the public of such determinations, applicants may seek MSHA product approval based on such non-MSHA product safety standards.</P>

Box 131, CH-1211 GENEVA 20, Switzerland.</P>
              <P>(i) Enclosures associated with an electric motor assembly shall be made of metal and not have a compartment exceeding ten (10) feet in length. External surfaces of enclosures shall not exceed 150 °C (302 °F) in normal operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Enclosures shall be rugged in construction and should meet existing requirements for minimum bolt size and spacing and for minimum wall, cover, and flange thicknesses specified in paragraph (g)(19) of § 7.304 Technical requirements. Enclosure fasteners should be uniform in size and length, be provided at all corners, and be secured from loosening by lockwashers or equivalent. An engineering analysis shall be provided for enclosure designs that deviate from the existing requirements. The analysis shall show that the proposed enclosure design meets or exceeds the mechanical strength of a comparable enclosure designed to 150 psig according to existing requirements, and that flamepath clearances in excess of existing requirements will not be produced at an internal pressure of 150 psig. This shall be verified by explosion testing the enclosure at a minimum of 150 psig.</P>
              <P>(iii) Enclosures shall be designed to withstand a minimum pressure of at least 150 psig without leakage through any welds or castings, rupture of any part that affects explosion-proof integrity, clearances exceeding those permitted under existing requirements along flame-arresting paths, or permanent distortion exceeding 0.040-inch per linear foot.</P>
              <P>(iv) Flamepath clearances, including clearances between fasteners and the holes through which they pass, shall not exceed those specified in existing requirements. No intentional gaps in flamepaths are permitted.</P>
              <P>(v) The minimum lengths of the flame arresting paths, based on enclosure volume, shall conform to those specified in existing requirements to the nearest metric equivalent value (e.g., 12.5 mm, 19 mm, and 25 mm are considered equivalent to <FR>1/2</FR> inch, <FR>3/4</FR> inch and 1 inch respectively for plane and cylindrical joints). The widths of any grooves for o-rings shall be deducted in measuring the widths of flame-arresting paths.</P>
              <P>(vi) Gaskets shall not be used to form any part of a flame-arresting path. If o-rings are installed within a flamepath, the location of the o-rings shall meet existing requirements.</P>
              <P>(vii) Cable entries into enclosures shall be of a type that utilizes either flame-resistant rope packing material or sealing rings (grommets). If plugs and mating receptacles are mounted to an enclosure wall, they shall be of explosion-proof construction. Insulated bushings or studs shall not be installed in the outside walls of enclosures. Lead entrances utilizing sealing compounds and flexible or rigid metallic conduit are not permitted.</P>
              <P>(viii) Unused lead entrances shall be closed with a metal plug that is secured by spot welding, brazing, or equivalent.</P>

              <P>(ix) Special explosion tests are required for electric motor assemblies <PRTPAGE P="20"/>that share leads (electric conductors) through a common wall with another explosion-proof enclosure, such as a motor winding compartment and a conduit box. These tests are required to determine the presence of any pressure piling conditions in either enclosure when one or more of the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts are sequentially removed from the common wall between the enclosures. Enclosures that exhibit pressures during these tests that exceed those specified in existing requirements must be provided with a warning tag. The durable warning tag must indicate that the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts be maintained in order to insure the explosion-proof integrity for either enclosure sharing a common wall. A warning tag is not required if the enclosures withstand a static pressure of twice the maximum value observed in the explosion tests.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) After MSHA has determined that non-MSHA product safety standards are equivalent and has notified the public of such determinations, applicants may seek MSHA product approval based on such non-MSHA product safety standards.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Test procedures.</E> (1) Prepare 6 samples of brattice cloth 40 inches wide by 48 inches long.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to testing, condition each sample for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21 ±5.5 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ±10%.</P>
              <P>(3) For each test, suspend the sample in the gallery by wrapping the brattice cloth around the rod and clamping each end and the center. The brattice cloth must hang 4 inches from the gallery floor.</P>

              <P>(4) Use a front exhaust system to remove smoke escaping from the gallery. The exhaust system must remain on during all testing, but not affect the air flow in the gallery.<PRTPAGE P="22"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Set the methane-fueled impinged jet burner to yield a flame height of 12 inches as measured at the outermost tip of the flame.</P>
              <P>(6) Apply the burner to the front lower edge of the brattice cloth and keep it in contact with the material for 25 seconds or until 1 foot of material, measured horizontally, is consumed, whichever occurs first. If the material shrinks during application of the burner flame, move the burner flame to maintain contact with 1 foot of the material. If melting material might clog the burner orifices, rotate the burner slightly during application of the flame.</P>
              <P>(7) Test 3 samples in still air and 3 samples with an average of 125 ft./min. of air flowing past the sample.</P>
              <P>(8) Record the propagation length and duration of burning for each of the 6 samples. The duration of burning is the total burning time of the specimen during the flame test. This includes the burn time of any material that falls on the floor of the test gallery during the igniting period. However, the suspended specimen is considered burning only after the burner is removed. Should the burning time of a suspended specimen and a specimen on the floor coincide, count the coinciding burning time only once.</P>
              <P>(9) Calculate the average duration of burning for the first 3 samples (still air) and the second 3 samples (125 ft./min. air flow).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Test procedures.</E> (1) Prepare two samples for testing that measure 5 inches by <FR>1/2</FR> inch, by the thickness of the material as it will be used. Prior to testing, condition the samples at 73.4 ±3.6 °F (23 ±2 °C) and 50 ±5% relative humidity for at least 40 hours.</P>
              <P>(2) Place a sample on supports which are 4 inches apart and immersed in a heat transfer medium at a test temperature range of 65 °F−80 °F (18.3 °C−26.7 °C). The heat transfer medium must be a liquid which will not chemically affect the sample. The testing apparatus must be constructed so that expansion of any components during heating of the medium does not result in deflection of the sample.</P>
              <P>(3) Place a temperature measuring device with an accuracy of 1% into the heat transfer medium within <FR>1/8</FR> inch of, but not touching, the sample.</P>
              <P>(4) Apply a total load, in pounds, numerically equivalent to 11 times the thickness of the sample, in inches, to the sample midway between the supports using a <FR>1/8</FR> inch radius, rounded contact. The total load includes that weight used to apply the load and any force exerted by the deflection measurement device.</P>
              <P>(5) Use a deflection measuring device with an accuracy of ±.001 inches to measure the deflection of the sample at the point of loading as the temperature of the medium is increased at a uniform rate of 3.6 ±.36 °F/min. (2 ±0.2 °C/min.). Apply the load to the sample for 5 minutes prior to heating, to allow compensation for creep in the sample due to the loading.</P>
              <P>(6) Record the deflection of the sample due to heating at 180 °F (82 °C).</P>
              <P>(7) Repeat steps 2 through 6 for the other sample.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Explosion tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Test procedures.</E> (1) Prepare to test the diesel power package as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Perform a detailed check of parts against the drawings and specifications submitted under § 7.97 to determine that the parts and drawings agree.</P>
              <P>(ii) Remove all parts that do not contribute to the operation or ensure the explosion-proof integrity of the diesel power package such as the air cleaner and exhaust gas dilution system.</P>
              <P>(iii) Fill coolant system fluid and engine oil to the engine manufacturer's recommended levels.</P>
              <P>(iv) Interrupt fuel supply to the injector pump.</P>
              <P>(v) Establish a preliminary low water level for systems using the wet exhaust conditioner as a flame arrester.</P>
              <P>(2) Perform static and dynamic tests of the intake system as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Install the diesel power package in an explosion test chamber which is large enough to contain the complete diesel power package. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the flammable mixture surrounding the diesel power package. Couple the diesel power package to an auxiliary drive mechanism. Attach a pressure measuring device, a temperature measuring device, and an ignition source to the intake system. The pressure measuring device shall be capable of indicating the peak pressure accurate to ±1 pound-per-square inch gauge (psig) at 100 psig static pressure and shall have a frequency response of 40 Hertz or greater. The ignition source shall be an electric spark with a minimum energy of 100 millijoules. The ignition source shall be located immediately adjacent to the intake manifold and the pressure and temperature devices shall be located immediately adjacent to the flame arrester.</P>
              <P>(ii) For systems using the wet exhaust conditioner as an exhaust flame arrester, fill the exhaust conditioner to the specified high or normal operating water level.</P>
              <P>(iii) Fill the test chamber with a mixture of natural gas and air or methane and air. If natural gas is used, the content of combustible hydrocarbons shall total at least 98.0 percent, by volume, with the remainder being inert. At least 80.0 percent, by volume, of the gas shall be methane. For all tests, the methane or natural gas concentration shall be 8.5 ±1.8 percent, by volume, and the oxygen concentration shall be no less than 18 percent, by volume.</P>
              <P>(iv) Using the auxiliary drive mechanism, motor the engine to fill the intake and exhaust systems with the flammable mixture. The intake system, exhaust system, and test chamber gas concentration shall not differ by more than ±0.3 percent, by volume, at the time of ignition.</P>

              <P>(v) For static tests, stop the engine, actuate the ignition source, and observe the peak pressure. The peak pressure shall not exceed 110 psig. If the peak pressure exceeds 110 psig, construction changes shall be made that result in a reduction of pressure to 110 <PRTPAGE P="59"/>psig or less, or the system shall be tested in accordance with the static pressure test of § 7.104 with the pressure parameter replaced with a static pressure of twice the highest value recorded.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the peak pressure does not exceed 110 psig or if the system meets the static pressure test requirements of this section and there is no discharge of visible flames or glowing particles or ignition of the flammable mixture in the chamber, a total of 20 tests shall be conducted in accordance with the explosion test specified above.</P>
              <P>(vii) For dynamic tests, follow the same procedures for static tests, except actuate the ignition source while motoring the engine. Forty dynamic tests shall be conducted at two speeds, twenty at 1800 ±200 RPM and twenty at 1000 ±200 RPM. Under some circumstances, during dynamic testing the flammable mixture may continue to burn within the diesel power package after ignition. This condition can be recognized by the presence of a rumbling noise and a rapid increase in temperature. This can cause the flame-arrester to reach temperatures which can ignite the surrounding flammable mixture. Ignition of the flammable mixture in the test chamber under these circumstances does not constitute failure of the flame arrester. However; if this condition is observed, the test operator should immediately stop the engine and allow components to cool to prevent damage to the components.</P>
              <P>(3) Perform static and dynamic tests of the exhaust system as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Prepare the diesel power package for explosion tests according to § 7.100(a)(2)(i) as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Install the ignition source immediately adjacent to the exhaust manifold.</P>
              <P>(B) Install pressure measuring devices in each segment as follows: immediately adjacent to the exhaust conditioner inlet; in the exhaust conditioner; and immediately adjacent to the flame arrester, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(C) Install a temperature device immediately adjacent to the exhaust conditioner inlet.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the exhaust system is provided with a spaced-plate flame arrester in addition to an exhaust conditioner, explosion tests of the exhaust system shall be performed as described for the intake system in accordance with this section. Water shall not be present in a wet exhaust conditioner for the tests.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the wet exhaust conditioner is used as the exhaust flame arrester, explosion testing of this type of system shall be performed as described for the intake system in accordance with this section with the following modifications:</P>
              <P>(A) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at 2 inches below the minimum allowable low water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be opened. These openings may include lines which connect the reserve water supply to the wet exhaust conditioner, insert flanges, float flanges, and cover plates. These entrances are opened during this test to verify that they are not flame paths.</P>
              <P>(B) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at 2 inches below the minimum allowable low water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner (except the exhaust conditioner outlet) which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be closed. These openings are closed to simulate normal operation.</P>
              <P>(C) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at the specified high or normal operating water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be opened.</P>
              <P>(D) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at the specified high or normal operating water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner (except the exhaust conditioner outlet) which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be closed.</P>

              <P>(iv) After successful completion of the explosion tests of the exhaust system, the minimum allowable low water level, for a wet exhaust conditioner used as the exhaust flame arrester, shall be determined by adding two <PRTPAGE P="60"/>inches to the lowest water level that passed the explosion tests.</P>
              <P>(v) A determination shall be made of the maximum grade on which the wet exhaust conditioner can be operated retaining the flame-arresting characteristics.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable performance.</E> The explosion tests shall not result in any of the following—</P>
              <P>(1) Discharge of flame or glowing particles.</P>
              <P>(2) Visible discharge of gas through gasketed joints.</P>
              <P>(3) Ignition of the flammable mixture in the test chamber.</P>

              <P>(5) Clearances, in excess of those specified in this subpart, along accessible flame-arresting paths, following any necessary retightening of fastenings.</P>
              <P>(6) Pressure exceeding 110 psig, unless the intake system or exhaust system has withstood a static pressure of twice the highest value recorded in the explosion tests of this section following the static pressure test procedures of § 7.104.</P>

              <P>(a) The following shall be used for conducting an explosion test:</P>

              <P>(1) An explosion test chamber designed and constructed to contain an <PRTPAGE P="68"/>explosive gas mixture to surround and fill the motor assembly being tested. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the explosive mixture surrounding the motor assembly.</P>
              <P>(2) A methane gas supply with at least 98 by volume per centum of combustible hydrocarbons, with the remainder being inert. At least 80 percent by volume of the gas shall be methane.</P>
              <P>(3) Coal dust having a minimum of 22 percent dry volatile matter and a minimum heat constant of 11,000 moist BTU (coal containing natural bed moisture but not visible surface water) ground to a fineness of minus 200 mesh U.S. Standard sieve series.</P>
              <P>(4) An electric spark ignition source with a minimum of 100 millijoules of energy.</P>
              <P>(5) A pressure recording system that will indicate the pressure peaks resulting from the ignition and combustion of explosive gas mixtures within the enclosure being tested.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General test procedures.</E> (1) Motor assemblies being tested shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Be equipped with unshielded bearings regardless of the type of bearings specified; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Have all parts that do not contribute to the operation or assure the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure, such as oil seals, grease fittings, hose conduit, cable clamps, and outer bearing caps (which do not house the bearings) removed from the motor assembly.</P>
              <P>(2) Each motor assembly shall be placed in the explosion test chamber and tested as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The motor assembly shall be filled with and surrounded by an explosive mixture of the natural gas supply and air. The chamber gas concentrations shall be between 6.0 by volume per centum and the motor assembly natural gas concentration just before ignition of each test. Each externally visible flame-arresting path fit shall be observed for discharge of flames for at least two of the tests, including one with coal dust added.</P>
              <P>(ii) A single spark source is used for all testing. Pressure shall be measured at each end of the winding compartment simultaneously during all tests. Quantity and location of test holes shall permit ignition on each end of the winding compartment and recording of pressure on the same and opposite ends as the ignition.</P>
              <P>(iii) Motor assemblies incorporating a conduit box shall have the pressure in the conduit box recorded simultaneously with the other measured pressures during all tests. Quantity and location of test holes in the conduit box shall permit ignition and recording of pressure as required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) The motor assembly shall be completely purged and recharged with a fresh explosive gas mixture from the chamber or by injection after each test. The chamber shall be completely purged and recharged with a fresh explosive gas mixture as necessary. The oxygen level of the chamber gas mixture shall be no less than 18 percent by volume for testing. In the absence of oxygen monitoring equipment, the maximum number of tests conducted before purging shall be less than or equal to the chamber volume divided by forty times the volume occupied by the motor assembly.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test procedures.</E> (1) Eight tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume within the winding compartment shall be conducted, with the rotor stationary during four tests and rotating at rated speed (rpm) during four tests. The ignition shall be at one end of the winding compartment for two stationary and two rotating tests, and then switched to the opposite end for the remaining four tests. If a nonisolated conduit box is used, then two additional tests, one stationary and one rotating, shall be conducted with ignition in the conduit box at a point furthest away from the opening between the conduit box and the winding compartment.</P>
              <P>(2) Four tests at 7.0 ±0.3 percent methane by volume within the winding compartment shall be conducted with the rotor stationary, 2 ignitions at each end.</P>

              <P>(3) Four tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume plus coal dust shall be conducted. A quantity of coal dust <PRTPAGE P="69"/>equal to 0.05 ounces per cubic foot of internal free volume of the winding compartment plus the nonisolated conduit box shall be introduced into each end of the winding compartment and nonisolated conduit box to coat the interior surface before conducting the first of the four tests. The coal dust introduced into the conduit box shall be proportional to its volume. The remaining coal dust shall be equally divided between the winding compartment ends. For two tests, one stationary and one rotating, the ignition shall be either in the conduit box or one end of the connected winding compartment, whichever produced the highest pressure in the previous tests. The two remaining tests, one stationary and one rotating, shall be conducted with the ignition in the winding compartment end furthest away from the conduit box.</P>
              <P>(4) For motor assemblies incorporating a conduit box which is isolated from the winding compartment by an isolating barrier the following additional tests shall be conducted—</P>
              <P>(i) For conduit boxes with an internal free volume greater than 150 cubic inches, two ignition points shall be used, one as close to the geometric center of the conduit box as practical and the other at the furthest point away from the isolating barrier between the conduit box and the winding compartment. Recording of pressure shall be on the same and opposite sides as the ignition point furthest from the isolating barrier between the conduit box and the winding compartment. Conduit boxes with an internal free volume of 150 cubic inches or less shall have one test hole for ignition located as close to the geometric center of the conduit box as practical and one for recording of pressure located on a side of the conduit box.</P>
              <P>(ii) The conduit box shall be tested separately. Six tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume within the conduit box shall be conducted followed by two tests at 7.0 ±0.3 percent methane by volume. Then two tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume with a quantity of coal dust equal to 0.05 ounces per cubic foot of internal free volume of the conduit box and meeting the specifications in paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be conducted. For conduit boxes with an internal free volume of more than 150 cubic inches, the number of tests shall be evenly divided between each ignition point.</P>
              <P>(iii) The motor assembly shall be tested following removal of the isolating barrier or one sectionalizing terminal (as applicable). Six tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume in the winding compartment and conduit box shall be conducted using three ignition locations. The ignition shall be at one end of the winding compartment for one stationary and one rotating test; the opposite end for one stationary and one rotating test; and at the ignition point that produced the highest pressure on the previous test in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in the conduit box for one stationary and one rotating test. Motor assemblies that use multiple sectionalizing terminals shall have one test conducted as each additional terminal is removed. Each of these tests shall use the rotor state and ignition location that produced the highest pressure in the previous tests.</P>
              <P>(d) A motor assembly incorporating a conduit box that is isolated from the winding compartment that exhibits pressures exceeding 110 psig, while testing during removal of any or all isolating barriers as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, shall have a warning statement on the approval plate. This statement shall warn that the isolating barrier must be maintained to ensure the explosion-proof integrity of the motor assembly. A statement is not required when the motor assembly has withstood a static pressure of twice the maximum pressure recorded in the explosion tests of paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The static pressure test shall be conducted on the motor assembly with all isolating barriers removed, and in accordance with § 7.307 of this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 7.407</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Test for flame resistance of electric cables and cable splices.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> (1) For electric cables, prepare 3 specimens of cable, each 3 feet in length, by removing 5 inches of jacket material and 2<FR>1/2</FR> inches of conductor insulation from both ends of each test specimen. For splices, prepare a splice specimen in each of 3 sections of MSHA-approved flame-resistant cable. The cable shall be of the type that the splice kit is designed to repair. The finished splice shall not exceed 18 inches or be less than 6 inches in length for test purposes. The spliced cables shall be 3 feet in length with the midpoint of the splice located 14 inches from one end. Both ends of each of the spliced cables shall be prepared by removing 5 inches of jacket material and 2<FR>1/2</FR> inches of conductor insulation. The type, amperage, voltage rating, and construction of the cable shall be compatible with the splice kit design. Each splice shall be made in accordance with the instructions provided with the splice kit.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to testing, condition each test specimen for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21.1 ±5.5 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ±10 percent. These environmental conditions shall be maintained during testing.</P>
              <P>(3) For electric cables, locate the sensing element of the temperature measuring device 26 inches from one end of each test specimen. For splices, locate the sensing element 12 inches from the midpoint of the splice and 10 inches from the end of the cable. The sensing element must be secured so that it remains in direct contact with the metallic portion of the power conductor for the duration of the flame-resistant test. If a thermocouple-type temperature measuring instrument is used, connect the sensing element through the cable jacket and power conductor insulation. Other means for monitoring conductor temperature may be used, provided the temperature measurement is made at the same location. If the jacket and conductor insulation must be disturbed to insert the temperature measuring device, each must be restored as closely as possible to its original location and maintained there for the duration of the testing.</P>

              <P>(4) Center the test specimen horizontally in the test chamber on the three rods. The three rods shall be positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the test specimen and at the same height, which permits the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner, when adjusted in accordance with the test procedure, to touch the jacket of the test specimen. The specimen shall be maintained at this level for the duration of the flame test. The two outermost rods shall be placed so that 1 inch of cable jacket extends beyond each rod. For electric cables, the third rod shall be placed 14 inches from the end of the test specimen nearer the temperature monitoring location on the specimen. For splices, the third rod shall be placed between the splice and the temperature monitoring <PRTPAGE P="83"/>location at a distance 8 inches from the midpoint of the splice. The specimen shall be free from external air currents during testing.</P>
              <P>(5) Adjust the gas burner to give an overall blue flame 5 inches high with a 3-inch inner cone. There shall be no persistence of yellow coloration.</P>
              <P>(6) Connect all power conductors of the test specimen to the current source. The connections shall be secure and compatible with the size of the cable's power conductors in order to reduce contact resistance.</P>
              <P>(7) Energize all power conductors of the test specimen with an effective heating current value of 5 times the power conductor ampacity rating (to the nearest whole ampere) at an ambient temperature of 104 °F (40 °C).</P>
              <P>(8) Monitor the electric current through the power conductors of the test specimen with the current measuring device. Adjust the amount of heating current, as required, to maintain the proper effective heating current value within ±5 percent until the power conductors reach a temperature of 400 °F (204.4 °C).</P>
              <P>(9) For electric cables, apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner directly beneath the test specimen for 60 seconds at a location 14 inches from one end of the cable and between the supports separated by a 16-inch distance. For splices, apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of a gas burner for 60 seconds beneath the midpoint of the splice jacket.</P>
              <P>(10) After subjecting the test specimen to external flame for the specified time, fully remove the flame of the gas from beneath the specimen without disturbing air currents within the test chamber. Simultaneously turn off the heating current.</P>
              <P>(11) Record the amount of time the test specimen continues to burn after the flame from the gas burner has been removed. The duration of burning includes the burn time of any material that falls from the test specimen after the flame from the gas has been removed.</P>
              <P>(12) Record the length of burned (charred) area of each test specimen measured longitudinally along the cable axis.</P>
              <P>(13) Repeat the procedure for the remaining two specimens.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable performance.</E> Each of the three test specimens shall meet the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The duration of burning shall not exceed 240 seconds.</P>
              <P>(2) The length of the burned (charred) area shall not exceed 6 inches.</P>

              <P>(2) For each of three tests, place one belt sample with the load-carrying surface facing up on the rails of the rack so that the sample extends 1 ±<FR>1/8</FR> inch (2.5 ±0.3 cm) beyond the front of the rails and 1 ±<FR>1/8</FR> inch (2.5 ±0.3 cm) from the outer lengthwise edge of each rail;</P>
              <P>(3) Fasten the sample to the rails of the rack with steel washers and cotter pins. The cotter pins shall extend at least <FR>3/4</FR> inch (1.9 cm) below the rails. Equivalent fasteners may be used. Make a series of 5 holes approximately <FR>9/32</FR> inch (0.7 cm) in diameter along both edges of the belt sample, starting at the first rail hole within 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the front edge of the sample. Make the next hole 5 ±<FR>1/4</FR> inches (12.7 ±0.6 cm) from the first, the third hole 5 ±<FR>1/4</FR> inches (12.7 ±0.6 cm) from the second, the fourth hole approximately midway along the length of the sample, and the fifth hole near the end of the sample. After placing a washer over each sample hole, insert a cotter pin through the hole and spread it apart to secure the sample to the rail;</P>
              <P>(4) Center the rack and sample in the test chamber with the front end of the sample 6 ±<FR>1/2</FR> inches (15.2 ±1.27 cm) from the entrance;</P>
              <P>(5) Measure the airflow with a 4-inch (10.2 cm) diameter vane anemometer, or an equivalent device, placed on the centerline of the belt sample 12 ±<FR>1/2</FR> inches (30.5 ±1.27 cm) from the chamber entrance. Adjust the airflow passing through the chamber to 200 ±20 ft/min (61 ±6 m/min);</P>
              <P>(6) Before starting the test on each sample, the inner surface temperature of the chamber roof measured at points 6 ±<FR>1/2</FR>, 30 ±<FR>1/2</FR>, and 60 ±<FR>1/2</FR> inches (15.2 ±1.27, 76.2 ±1.27, and 152.4 ±1.27 cm) from the front entrance of the chamber must not exceed 95 °Fahrenheit (35 °Centigrade) at any of these points with the specified airflow passing through the chamber. The temperature of the air entering the chamber during the test on each sample must not be less than 50 °Fahrenheit (10 °Centigrade);</P>
              <P>(7) Center the burner in front of the sample's leading edge with the plane, defined by the tips of the burner jets, <FR>3/4</FR> ±<FR>1/8</FR> inch (1.9 ±0.3 cm) from the front edge of the belt;</P>
              <P>(8) With the burner lowered away from the sample, set the gas flow at 1.2 ±0.1 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) (34 ±2.8 liters per minute) and then ignite the gas burner. Maintain the gas flow to the burner throughout the 5 to 5.1 minute ignition period;</P>
              <P>(9) After applying the burner flame to the front edge of the sample for a 5 to 5.1 minute ignition period, lower the burner away from the sample and extinguish the burner flame;</P>
              <P>(10) After completion of each test, determine the undamaged portion across the entire width of the sample. Blistering without charring does not constitute damage.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable performance.</E> Each tested sample must exhibit an undamaged portion across its entire width.</P>
              <P>(c) MSHA may modify the procedures of the flammability test for belts constructed of thicknesses more than <FR>3/4</FR> inch (1.9 cm).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Chemical composition.</E> The chemical composition of the explosive shall be within the tolerances furnished by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate-of-detonation test.</E> The explosive shall propagate completely in the rate-of-detonation tesst. The test is conducted at an ambient temperature between 68 and 86 °F. Nongelatinous explosives are initiated with a test detonator only, while gelatinous explosives are initiated with a test detonator and a 60-gram tetryl pellet booster. The test is conducted on—</P>
              <P>(1) A 50-inch column of 1<FR>1/4</FR> inch diameter cartridges; and</P>
              <P>(2) A 50-inch column of the smallest diameter cartridges less than 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches submitted for testing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Air-gap sensitivity.</E> The air-gap sensitivity of the explosive shall be at least 2 inches at the minimum product firing temperature and 3 inches at a temperature between 68 and 86 °F, and the explosive shall propagate completely.</P>
              <P>(1) Air-gap sensitivity of the explosive is determined in the explosion-by-influence test using the 7-inch cartridge method. The air-gap sensitivity is determined for 1<FR>1/4</FR> inch diameter cartridges and each cartridge diameter smaller than 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches. Explosives are initiated with a test detonator.</P>

              <P>(2) The 7-inch cartridge method is conducted with two 8-inch cartridges. One inch is cut off the end of each cartridge. The cartridges are placed in a paper tube, the cut ends facing each other, with the appropriate 2-inch or 3-inch air gap between them. The test is <PRTPAGE P="99"/>conducted at a temperature between 68 and 86 °F and at the minimum product firing temperature proposed by the applicant, or 41 °F, whichever is lower. The test temperature at which the explosive propagates completely will be specified in the approval as the minimum product firing temperature at which the explosive is approved for use.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Gallery Test 7.</E> The explosive shall yield a value of at least 450 grams for the lower 95 percent confidence limit (L<E T="52">95</E>) on the weight for 50 percent probability of ignition (W<E T="52">50</E>) in gallery test 7 and shall propagate completely. The L<E T="52">95</E> and W<E T="52">50</E> values for the explosive are determined by using the Bruceton up-and-down method. A minimum of 20 trials are made with explosive charges of varying weights, including wrapper and seals. Each charge is primed with a test detonator, then tamped and stemmed with one pound of dry-milled fire clay into the borehole of a steel cannon. The cannon is fired into air containing 7.7 to 8.3 percent of natural gas. The air temperature is between 68 and 86 °F.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Gallery Test 8.</E> The explosive shall yield a value of at least 350 grams for the weight for 50 percent probability of ignition (W<E T="52">CDG</E>) in gallery test 8 and shall propagate completely. The (W<E T="52">CDG</E>) value for the explosive is determined using the Bruceton up-and-down method. A minimum of 10 tests are made with explosive charges of varying weights, including wrapper and seals. Each charge is primed with a test detonator, then tamped into the borehole of a steel cannon. The cannon is fired into a mixture of 8 pounds of bituminous coal dust predispersed into 640 cubic feet of air containing 3.8 to 4.2 percent of natural gas. The air temperature is between 68 and 86 °F.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Pendulum-friction test.</E> The explosive shall show no perceptible reaction in the pendulum-friction test with the hard fiber-faced shoe. Ten trials of the test are conducted by releasing the steel shoe from a height of 59 inches. If there is evidence of sensitivity, the test is repeated with the hard fiber-faced shoe.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Toxic gases.</E> The total volume equivalent to carbon monoxide (CO) of toxic gases produced by detonation of the explosive shall not exceed 2.5 cubic feet per pound of explosive as determined in the large chamber test. The explosive shall propagate completely.</P>
              <P>(1) The large chamber test is conducted with a one-pound explosive charge, including wrapper and seal, primed with a test detonator. The explosive charge is loaded into the borehole of a steel cannon, then tamped and stemmed with one pound of dry-milled fire clay. The cannon is fired into the large chamber and the gaseous products resulting from detonation of the explosive are collected and analyzed for toxic gases. At least two trials are conducted.</P>
              <P>(2) The equivalent volume of each toxic gas produced, relative to CO, is determined by multiplying the measured volume of the gas by a conversion factor. The conversion factor is equal to the threshold limit value, time weighted average (TLV-TWA) in parts-per-million for CO divided by the TLV-TWA for the toxic gas. The TLV-TWA conversion factor for each gas for which MSHA shall test is specified in Table I of this subpart. The total volume equivalent to CO of the toxic gases produced by detonation of the explosive is the sum of the equivalent volumes of the individual toxic gases.</P>

Some tests included in these requirements may be omitted on the basis of previous experience.</P>
              <P>(2) Intrinsically safe circuits and/or components will be subjected to tests consisting of making and breaking the intrinsically safe circuit under conditions judged to simulate the most hazardous probable faults or malfunctions. Tests will be made in the most easily ignitable mixture of methane or natural gas and air. The method of making and breaking the circuit may be varied to meet a particular condition.</P>
              <P>(3) Those components which affect intrinsic safety must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Current limiting components shall consist of two equivalent devices each of which singly will provide intrinsic safety. They shall not be operated at more than 50 percent of their ratings.</P>
              <P>(ii) Components of reliable construction shall be used and they shall be so mounted as to provide protection against shock and vibration in normal use.</P>
              <P>(iii) Semiconductors shall be amply sized. Rectifiers and transistors shall be operated at not more than two-thirds of their rated current and permissible peak inverse voltage.

              <P>(iv) Electrolytic capacitors shall be operated at not more than two-thirds of their rated voltage. They shall be designed to withstand a test voltage of 1,500 volts.</P>
              <P>(4) Intrinsically safe circuits shall be so designed that after failure of a single component, and subsequent failures resulting from this first failure, the circuit will remain intrinsically safe.</P>
              <P>(5) The circuit will be considered as intrinsically safe if in the course of testing no ignitions occur.</P>
              <P>(b) Complete intrinsically safe equipment powered by low energy batteries:</P>
              <P>(1) Short-circuit tests shall be conducted on batteries at normal operating temperature. Tests may be made on batteries at elevated temperature if such tests are deemed necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) Resistance devices for limiting short-circuit current shall be an integral part of the battery, or installed as close to the battery terminal as practicable.</P>
              <P>(3) Transistors of battery-operated equipment may be subjected to thermal “run-away” tests to determine that they will not ignite an explosive atmosphere.</P>

              <P>(4) A minimum of 1,000 make-break sparks will be produced in each test for <PRTPAGE P="130"/>direct current circuits with consideration given to reversed polarity.</P>
              <P>(5) Tests on batteries shall include series and/or parallel combinations of twice the normal battery complement, and the effect of capacitance and inductance, added to that normally present in the circuit.</P>
              <P>(6) No ignition shall occur when approximately <FR>1/2</FR>-inch of a single wire strand representative of the wire used in the equipment or device is shorted across the intrinsically safe circuit.</P>
              <P>(7) Consideration shall be given to insure against accidental reversal of polarity.</P>
              <P>(c) Line-powered equipment and devices:</P>
              <P>(1) Line-powered equipment shall meet all applicable provisions specified for battery-powered equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) Nonintrinsically safe components supplying power for intrinsically safe circuits shall be housed in explosion-proof enclosures and be provided with energy limiting components in the enclosure.</P>
              <P>(3) Wiring for nonintrinsically safe circuits shall not be intermingled with wiring for intrinsically safe circuits.</P>
              <P>(4) Transformers that supply power for intrinsically safe circuits shall have the primary and secondary windings physically separated. They shall be designed to withstand a test voltage of 1,500 volts when rated 125 volts or less and 2,500 volts when rated more than 125 volts.</P>
              <P>(5) The line voltage shall be increased to 120 percent of nominal rated voltage to cover power line voltage variations.</P>
              <P>(6) In investigations of alternating current circuits a minimum of 5,000 make-break sparks will be produced in each test.</P>
              <P>(d) The design of intrinsically safe circuits shall preclude extraneous voltages caused by insufficient isolation or inductive coupling. The investigation shall determine the effect of ground faults where applicable.</P>
              <P>(e) Identification markings: Circuits and components of intrinsically safe equipment and devices shall be adequately identified by marking or labeling. Battery-powered equipment shall be marked to indicate the manufacturer, type designation, ratings, and size of batteries used.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The purpose of investigations made under this part is to promote the development of electric cap lamps that may be used in mines, especially in mines that may contain dangerous concentrations of methane. Lists of such lamps will be published from time to time in order that State mine-inspection departments, compensation bureaus, mine operators, miners, and others interested in safe equipment for mines may have information in regard to available permissible electric cap lamps. This part supersedes Schedule 6C issued under date of December 21, 1935, and goes into effect August 26, 1939.</P>
            <P>(b) Any electric cap lamp that meets the requirements set forth in this part will be termed “permissible” by MSHA and, if actively marketed, will be listed as such in publications relating to permissible electric cap lamps. MSHA will test only electrical equipment that in the opinion of its qualified representatives is constructed of suitable materials, is of good quality workmanship, is based on sound engineering principles, and is safe for its intended use. MSHA reserves the right to modify design, construction, and test requirements to obtain the same degree of protection as provided by the tests described in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definition of permissible.</E> Completely assembled and conforming in every respect with the design formally approved by the MSHA under this part. (Approvals under this part are given only to equipment for use in gassy and dusty mines.)

            <SUBJECT>Protection against explosion hazard.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Unless properly designed, electric cap lamps may present two sources of probable explosion hazards: Ignition of an explosive atmosphere by the heated filament of the bulb in case the bulb glass is accidentally broken, and ignition by sparks or flashes from the battery. MSHA therefore requires the following safeguards:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Safety device or design.</E> The headpiece shall have a safety device to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air if the bulb glass surrounding the filament is broken. Alternatively, if the lamp is designed and constructed to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by protecting the bulb from breakage and preventing exposure of the hot filament, no safety device is required.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Headpiece lock or seal.</E> The headpiece shall be provided with a lock or seal to prevent unauthorized removal of the lens and tampering with the safety device, the bulb, or the electrical contacts.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Locks on charging terminals.</E> Lamps shall be equipped with a magnetic or other equally effective lock at the battery, the headpiece, or the cord assembly to prevent unauthorized access to live charging terminals.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Protection of battery terminals.</E> The battery covers of lamps that are recharged through the cord shall be so constructed and assembled as to prevent unauthorized access to the battery terminals.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Battery current restricted.</E> The amount of current flow between the conductors of the cord, if short-circuited just outside of the battery casing or cord armor, shall be limited by the design of the battery or by a <PRTPAGE P="146"/>fuse to such a value <SU>4</SU>
              <FTREF/> as will not produce sparks that will ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Protection against bodily hazard.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the wearer by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA therefore requires that:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Spilling of electrolyte.</E> The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that, when properly filled, the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under actual service conditions. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Performance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In addition to the general design and the safety features, MSHA considers that a lamp of permissible type should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to performance, as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time of burning and candlepower.</E> Permissible electric cap lamps shall burn for at least 10 consecutive hours on one charge of the battery and shall give during that period a mean candlepower of light beam of not less than 1.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Bulb life.</E> The average life of the bulbs shall be not less than 200 hours, and at least 92 percent of the bulbs shall have a life of 150 hours. The life of a bulb is the number of hours its main filament will burn in the cap lamp or its equivalent.</P>
            <P>The life of a bulb having main filaments in parallel is considered ended when the first filament ceases to burn; the life of a bulb having independent main filament is considered ended when the last filament ceases to burn.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Class 1 lamps.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Protection against explosion hazards.</E> Unless properly designed, class 1 lamps present two sources of probable explosion hazards: Ignition of an explosive atmosphere by the heated filament of the bulb in case the bulb glass is accidentally broken, and ignition by electric sparks or arcs from the battery or connections thereto. MSHA's therefore, requires the following safeguards:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Safety device or design.</E> The lighting unit shall have a safety device to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air if the bulb glass surrounding the filament is broken. Alternatively, if the lamp is designed and constructed of materials that will prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by protecting the bulb from breakage and preventing exposure of the hot filament, no separate safety device is required. Alternative designs will be evaluated by mechanical impact tests, temperature tests and thermal shock tests to determine that the protection provided is no less effective than a safety device.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Safety device</E> (<E T="03">protection</E>). The design of the safety device and the housing which protects it shall be such that the action of the safety device is positive; yet the lamp shall not be too readily extinguished during normal service by the unnecessary operation of the device.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Locks or seals.</E> For lamps other than flashlights, all parts, such as bulb housing and battery container, through which access may be had to live terminals or contacts shall be adequately sealed or equipped with magnetic or other equally reliable locks to prevent opening by unauthorized persons. For flashlights, provision shall be made for sealing the battery container.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Battery current restricted.</E> Unless all current-carrying parts including conductors, are adequately covered and protected by the sealed or locked compartments, the maximum possible current flow through that part shall be limited by battery design, or by an enclosed-type fuse inside the sealed or locked container, to values that will not produce sparks or arcs sufficient to ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Protection against bodily hazard.</E> This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the user by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA, therefore, requires that:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Spilling of electrolyte.</E> The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that when properly filled the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under conditions of normal use. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Corrosion of battery container.</E> The material of which the container is <PRTPAGE P="151"/>made shall resist corrosion under conditions of normal use.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Safety.</E> (1) Unless special features of the lamp prevent ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by the broken bulb or other igniting sources within the lamp, the bulb and all spark-producing parts must be enclosed in explosion-proof compartments.</P>
            <P>(2) Explosion-proof compartments will be tested while filled and surrounded with explosive mixtures of Pittsburgh natural gas <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> and air. A sufficient number of tests of each compartment will be made to prove that there is no danger of ignition of the mixture surrounding the lamp by explosions within the compartment. The lamp will not pass the above tests, even though the surrounding explosive mixtures are not ignited, if external flame is observed, if excessive pressures are developed, or if excessive distortion of any part of the compartment takes place.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> Investigation has shown that for practical purposes Pittsburgh natural gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory substitute for pure methane.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(3) Glass-enclosed parts of such compartments must be guarded and be of extra-heavy glass to withstand pick blows, and be adequately protected by shrouds or by an automatic cut-out that opens the lamp circuit if the enclosure is broken.</P>
            <P>(4) When an explosion-proof enclosure consists of two or more parts that are held together securely by bolts or some suitable means to permit assembly, the flanges comprising the joints between parts shall have surfaces with metal-to-metal contact, except enclosures requiring glass, in which case glass-to-metal joints are permitted. Gaskets, if adequate, may be used to obtain a firm seat for the glass but not elsewhere. Rubber, putty, and plaster of paris are not acceptable as material for gaskets. For enclosures having an unoccupied volume (air space) of more than 60 cubic inches the width of the joint measured along the shortest flame path from the inside to the outside of the enclosure shall not be less than 1 inch. When the unoccupied volume (air space) is less than 60 cubic inches, this path shall not be less than three-fourths inch.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Locks and seals</E> (<E T="03">lighting attachment</E>). Explosion-proof compartments shall be equipped with seals or locks that prevent unauthorized and unsafe opening of the compartments in a mine.</P>

            <P>Methane detectors approved under this part shall be portable. They shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for service conditions underground. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard if used in gaseous mine atmospheres nor any bodily hazard, such as spilling of battery electrolyte. They shall exhibit under <PRTPAGE P="155"/>laboratory test conditions various requirements of minimum performance that are specified in this part.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 22.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Specific requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Design.</E> In the determination of adequacy of design, the following points will be considered: (1) Materials used, (2) construction, (3) accuracy, (4) size and shape, (5) range of detection (or indication), (6) life of the active parts, and (7) attention required. The suitability of the materials and the construction shall be determined by preliminary inspection, by dropping tests, by laboratory and field tests in gas and air mixtures, and by the general behavior of the equipment during the investigation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Safety against explosion hazard</E>—(1) <E T="03">Detectors.</E> Detectors shall be constructed so that they will not cause external ignitions when used in gaseous mine atmospheres.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Seals or locks.</E> All parts through which external ignitions might result shall be covered and protected adequately. All covers shall be sealed adequately or equipped with magnetic or other equally reliable locks to prevent their being opened by unauthorized persons.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Glasses.</E> Glasses or glass windows shall be of good-quality glass and protected adequately against breakage. Unguarded windows may be considered adequate in this respect, provided they are of small diameter and are of reasonably thick glass.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Battery.</E> If the detector is equipped with a battery, it shall be of such design that it will not produce sparks that will ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Detectors of the flame type.</E> Methane detectors of the flame type shall be subject to the requirements of the flame-lamp schedule then in force.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Safety against bodily hazard.</E> Bodily hazard with battery-type detectors is due chiefly to possible burning of the user by electrolyte that has spilled from the battery. MSHA, therefore, requires that:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Spilling of electrolyte.</E> The battery shall be so designed and constructed that when properly filled it will not spill electrolyte under actual service conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Corrosion of battery container.</E> The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of use.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Performance.</E> In addition to the general design and safety features, MSHA considers that permissible types of methane detectors should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to their performance, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Detectors.</E> (i) When the detector is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions, it shall be possible to detect at least 1 percent methane in air, and increasing percentages up to 5 percent shall be shown by continuously increasing evidence.</P>
            <P>(ii) The average number of determinations that may be made in approximately 2-percent methane mixtures without recharging a battery or replacing a chemical accessory shall not be less than 25, and the average number of such determinations that may be made without replacing any other part shall be not less than 100.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Indicating detectors.</E> Indicating detectors shall give indications of as low as 0.25 percent methane. Detectors having an upper scale limit of 2 percent may be approved, but it is recommended that the detector be designed to give indications of as high as 4 percent methane. The indications for these percentages shall be within the limits of error specified in the following table:</P>

            <P>All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A device will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers have judged that it has met the requirements of the part and MSHA's records are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the device as it is to be commercially made. Individual parts of devices will not be approved. No verbal reports of the investigation will be given and no informal approvals will be granted. As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval, he shall be free to advertise his device as permissible.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certification of dust-collecting systems.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Manufacturers of dust-collecting systems that are designed for integral use on machines with drilling equipment may apply to MSHA to issue a certificate of performance for such systems. To qualify for a certificate of performance, the dust-collecting system shall have met satisfactorily the test requirements of Subpart C under specified operating conditions, such as type of drilling equipment, drilling speed, and power requirements and the construction thereof shall be adequately covered by specifications and drawings officially recorded and filed with MSHA. Individual parts of dust-collecting systems will not be certified for performance. Certificates of performance may be cited to fabricators of combination units as evidence that further inspection and testing of the dust-collecting system will not be required, provided the dust-collecting requirements of the drilling equipment do not exceed the limits of performance for which the system was certified. Since MSHA does not sanction the use of the words “permissible” or “approved” except as applying to completely assembled equipment, dust-collecting systems, which have been certified only as to performance, shall not be advertised or labeled in a manner inferring that such systems themselves are permissible or approved by MSHA. However, a certified system may be advertised as suitable for use on combination units for which certification may be desired if the limits of its performance are cited. Certified dust-collecting systems shall bear labels or tags which shall contain the following: “Performance-tested Dust Collecting, System, MSHA File No. P/T____,” and name of manufacturer, identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts, and description of the limitations for which performance is certified. MSHA will assign a P/T file number in the certification letter.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon completion of an investigation, MSHA will issue to the applicant either a certificate or a written notice of disapproval, as they case may require. No informal notification of approval will be issued. If a certificate is issued, no test data or detailed results of tests will accompany it. If a notice of disapproval is issued, it will be accompanied by details of the defects, with a view to possible correction. MSHA will not disclose, except to the applicant, any information on a unit or system upon which a notice of disapproval has been issued.</P>
              <P>(b) A certificate will be accompanied by a list of the drawings and specifications covering the details of design and construction of the unit or system, including the electrical parts, if applicable, upon which the certificate is based. Applicants shall keep exact duplicates of the drawings and specifications submitted and the list of drawing numbers referred to in § 33.6(d)(1) that relate to the certified unit or system, and these are to be adhered to exactly in production.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval plates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A certificate of approval will be accompanied by a photograph of a design for an approval plate, bearing the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the name of the applicant, the name of the unit, the approval number or space for the approval number (or numbers if permissibility of electrical parts is involved), spaces for the type and the serial numbers of the unit, conditions of approval, and identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts. When deemed necessary by MSHA, an appropriate statement shall be added, giving the precautions to be observed in maintaining the unit in an approved condition.</P>
              <P>(b) An approval plate for a unit designed for use in a nongassy coal mine shall state that any electrical parts are not certified for use in a gassy coal mine. (See § 33.38(c).)</P>
              <P>(c) The applicant shall reproduce the design either as a separate plate or by stamping or molding it in some suitable place on each unit to which it relates. The size, type, and method of attaching and location of an approval plate are subject to the approval of MSHA. The method of affixing the plate shall not impair the dust-collection or explosion-proof features of the unit.</P>
              <P>(d) The approval plate identifies the unit, to which it is attached, as permissible, and is the applicant's guarantee that the unit complies with the requirements of this part. Without an approval plate, no unit has the status of “permissible” under the provisions of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Use of the approval plate obligates the applicant to whom the certificate of approval was granted to maintain the quality of each unit bearing it and guarantees that it is manufactured and assembled according to the drawings and specifications upon which a certificate of approval was based. Use of the approval plate is not authorized except on units that conform strictly with the drawings and specifications upon which the certificate of approval was based.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Time lag is the time that elapses between the instant of injection and that of ignition of the test sample, as evidenced by flame.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Furnace.</E> The furnace in which the ignition-temperature test is conducted shall consist of a refractory (alundum or equivalent) cylinder 5 inches in internal diameter and 5 inches in height; <PRTPAGE P="187"/>a transite-ring top and a transite-disk bottom, each of which is attached to a metal cylinder. The furnace is heated by three elements as follows: (i) A circumferential heater embedded in the refractory cylinder; (ii) a top or toroidal-neck heater that surrounds the neck of the test flask; and (iii) a flat base heater on which the test flask rests. The temperature of each heating element shall be controlled independently by an autotransformer. Means shall be provided for applying thermocouples at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask, which shall be inserted upright in the furnace.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Temperature control.</E> Each autotransformer shall be so adjusted that the temperature at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask is uniform within ±2 °F. of the desired test temperature.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sample injection and timing.</E> A 0.07 cc. test sample shall be injected into the heated test flask with the hypodermic syringe, and the syringe shall be withdrawn immediately. Measurement of time shall start at the instant the sample is injected.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Observations.</E> (i) If flame does not result in 5 minutes or more after injection of the test sample, the sample shall be considered nonflammable at the test temperature, and the timer shall be stopped. The test flask shall then be flushed well with clean dry air and, after a lapse of 15 minutes or more, the test shall be repeated with the test flask temperature raised 50 °F. ±2 °F. above the first test temperature.</P>
              <P>(ii) If ignition (flame) is observed in 5 minutes or less after the injection of the test sample (0.07 cc.), the time lag (time interval) shall be noted. After an ignition occurs the temperature of the test flask shall be reduced 5 °F., and the test procedure repeated in decrements of 5 °F. until ignition no longer occurs and this temperature shall be noted as the first nonignition test temperature for the 0.07 cc. sample.</P>
              <P>(iii) The temperature shall be increased 50 °F. ±2 °F. above the first nonignition test temperature, and the ignition-temperature test procedure shall be repeated with a 0.10 cc. test sample injected into the heated test flask.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the lowest temperature at which ignition occurs with the 0.10 cc. sample (in decrements of 5 °F.) is lower than that obtained with the 0.07 cc. sample, the ignition-temperature test procedure shall be repeated using a test sample of 0.12 cc., then 0.15 cc., and so on by increments of 0.03 cc. until the lowest ignition temperature is obtained.</P>
              <P>(v) If the lowest temperature at which ignition is obtained with the 0.10 cc. sample is greater than that obtained with the 0.07 cc. sample, the ignition temperature test procedure shall be repeated by reducing the test sample to 0.05 cc. and then to 0.03 cc. until the lowest ignition temperature is obtained.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Appraisal of test.</E> A fluid shall be considered fire-resistant, according to the test requirements of this section: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in no instance of the ignition-temperature test procedure, as stated in this section, shall the ignition temperature of the test sample be less than 600 °F.</P>

The system shall withstand repeated internal explosions without permanent deformation or deterioration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exhaust flame arrester.</E> (1) The exhaust system of the engine shall be provided with a flame arrester to prevent propagation of flame or discharge of heated particles to a surrounding flammable mixture. The flame arrester shall be so positioned that only cooled exhaust gas will discharge through it and shall be so designed and attached that it can be removed for inspecting, cleaning, or repairing. Its construction shall be such that it can be cleaned readily. The flame arrester shall be of rugged construction to withstand the effects of repeated explosions within the exhaust system, and the material of construction shall resist deterioration in service. It shall be so mounted in the equipment assembly that it is protected from accidental external damage.</P>
              <P>(2) A spaced-plate flame arrester for the exhaust system shall meet the same requirements as flame arresters for the intake system (see § 36.23(b)(2)).</P>
              <P>(3) In lieu of a space-place flame arrester, an exhaust-gas cooling box or conditioner may be used as the exhaust flame arrester provided that explosion tests demonstrate that the cooling box will arrest flame. When used as a flame arrester the cooling box shall be equipped with a device to shut off automatically the fuel supply to the engine at a safe minimum water level. A cooling box used as a flame arrester shall withstand repeated explosion tests without permanent deformation. It shall be constructed of material, satisfactory to MSHA, that will resist deterioration in service.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exhaust cooling system.</E> (1) A cooling system shall be provided for the engine exhaust gas. The heat-dissipation capacity shall be capable of reducing the temperature of the undiluted exhaust gas to less than 170 °F. at the point of discharge from the cooling system under any condition of engine operation acceptable to MSHA. A device shall be provided that will automatically shut off the fuel supply to the engine immediately if the temperature of the exhaust gas exceeds 185 °F. at the point of discharge from the cooling system. Provision shall be made, acceptable to MSHA, to prevent restarting the engine after the fuel supply has been shut off automatically until the water supply in the cooling box has been replenished. When the cooling box is used as a flame arrester, one safety device may be accepted provided it controls a safe minimum water level in the cooling box and also prevents the final exhaust temperature from exceeding 185 °F.</P>
              <P>(2) Cooling shall be obtained by passing the exhaust gas through water or a dilute aqueous chemical solution held in a cooling box or conditioner, or by a spray of water or a dilute aqueous chemical solution that will enter the exhaust system near the outlet of the exhaust manifold, or a combination of the two methods. When a spray is used it shall be provided with a filtering device to protect the nozzle from clogging. Provisions shall be made for draining and cleaning all parts of the exhaust cooling system. Openings for draining and cleaning shall be closed and sealed or locked by a method satisfactory to MSHA.</P>
              <P>(3) The cooling system shall be constructed of corrosion-resistant metal suitable for the intended application.</P>
              <P>(4) The cooling system shall store enough water or aqueous solution to permit operation of the engine at one-third load factor for eight hours. The minimum quantity of usable water or aqueous solution available for cooling shall equal the consumption for one hour with the engine operating at maximum load and speed multiplied by 8 and this product divided by 3.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Surface temperature of engine and exhaust system.</E> (1) The temperature of any external surface of the engine or <PRTPAGE P="197"/>exhaust system shall not exceed 400 °F. under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA. Water-jacketed components shall have integral jackets and provision shall be made for positive circulation of water in the jackets and to automatically shut off the engine when the temperature in the cooling jacket(s) exceeds 212 °F. Insulated coverings to control surface temperature are not acceptable.</P>
              <P>(2) When a spray is used to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas, it shall be located as near as practicable to the outlet of the exhaust manifold.</P>
              <P>(3) Exterior surfaces of the exhaust system shall be designed to minimize accumulation and lodgement of dust or combustible substances and to permit ready access for cleaning.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Tightness of exhaust system.</E> All joints in the exhaust system shall be tight to prevent the flow of exhaust gas through them under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA. A tight system shall be obtained by the use of ground joints, or thin metal or metal-clad gaskets. All such joints shall be fitted with adequate through bolts and all gaskets shall be aligned and held firmly in position by the bolts or other suitable means. Such joints shall remain tight to prevent passage of flame or propagation of repeated internal explosions to a surrounding flammable mixture.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Dilution of exhaust gas.</E> (1) Provision shall be made to dilute the exhaust gas with and before it is discharged into the surrounding atmosphere. The discharged exhaust gas shall be so diluted with air that the mixture shall not contain more than 0.5 percent, by volume, of carbon dioxide; 0.01 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide; 0.0025 percent, by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as equivalent nitrogen dioxide); or 0.0010 percent, by volume, of aldehydes (calculated as equivalent formaldehyde) under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA.</P>
              <P>(2) The final diluted exhaust mixture shall be discharged in such a manner that it is directed away from the operator's compartment and also away from the breathing zones of persons required to be alongside the equipment.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Pressure-gage connection.</E> A connection shall be provided in the exhaust system for convenient, temporary attachment of a pressure gage at a point suitable for measuring the total back pressure in the system. The connection also shall be suitable for temporary attachment of gas-sampling equipment to the exhaust system. This opening shall be closed by a plug or other suitable device that is sealed or locked in place except when a gage or sampling tube is attached.</P>

              <P>Section 109(d) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 91-173, as amended by Pub. L. 95-164), requires each operator of a coal or other mine to file with the Secretary of Labor the name and address of such mine, the name and address of the person who controls or operates the mine, and any revisions in such names and addresses. Section 103(h) of the act requires the operator of a coal or other mine to provide such information as the Secretary of Labor may reasonably require from time to time to enable the Secretary to perform his functions under the act. The regulations in this Subpart B provide for the notification to the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the legal identity of the operator of a coal or other mine and the reporting of all changes in the legal identity of the operator as they occur. The submission of a properly completed Legal Identity Report Form No. 2000-7 required under Subpart C of this part will constitute adequate notification of legal identity to the Mine Safety and Health Administration.</P>

Where the authorized representative or the Secretary refuses to issue a citation or order with respect to such alleged violation or imminent danger, the representative of miners or miner may obtain review of such refusal in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A request for informal review shall be sent in writing to the appropriate district manager within 10 days of the date of the refusal to issue a citation or order and shall be accompanied by any supporting information the person requesting review wishes to submit.</P>
              <P>(c) After receipt of the request for informal review, the district manager or his agent may hold, at his or her discretion, an informal conference where the person requesting review can present his views.</P>
              <P>(d) After review of all written and oral statements submitted, the district manager may either affirm the refusal to issue a citation or order or may direct that a new inspection be conducted with respect to the alleged violation or imminent danger. The district manager shall furnish the person requesting review with a written statement of the reasons for his or her final disposition of the request as soon thereafter as possible.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Time for filing.</E> An application for temporary relief from enforcement of a mandatory standard may be filed at any time before a proposed decision and order is issued on a petition for modification and shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">With whom filed.</E> The application shall be filed with and decided by the appropriate Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigation and decision.</E> Upon receipt of an application for temporary relief, the Administrator shall cause an investigation to be made as to the merits of the application. As soon thereafter as practicable, but in no event greater than 60 days from filing of the application, the Administrator shall issue a decision. If the Administrator does not issue a decision within 60 days of filing of the application, the application shall be deemed to be denied.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Contents of application.</E> An application for temporary relief shall comply with applicable general requirements of this part, state the specific relief requested, and include specific evidence showing how the applicant meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Before temporary relief is granted, the applicant must clearly show that—</P>
              <P>(1) The application was filed in good faith;</P>
              <P>(2) The requested relief will not adversely affect the health or safety of miners in the affected mine;</P>
              <P>(3) An identifiable hazard to miners exists in the mine which is caused by application of the standard at the mine;</P>
              <P>(4) Other means will be used to reasonably address the hazard against which the original standard was designed to protect; and</P>
              <P>(5) Compliance with the standard while the petition for modification is pending will expose miners to the identifiable hazard upon which the application is based.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Response.</E> All parties to the proceeding in which an application for temporary relief has been filed shall have 15 days from receipt of the application to file a written response with the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> An application for temporary relief or a response to such an application may be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary matter.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Findings.</E> Temporary relief may be granted by the Administrator upon a finding that application of the standard at the mine will result in a diminution of safety to the miners at such mine.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges.</E> If the application for temporary relief is granted by the Administrator, any other party may request a hearing within 15 days of the Administrator's decision. The request shall be addressed to the Administrator and shall be referred by the Administrator, along with the petition for modification, to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with § 44.15. The hearing and decision of the presiding administrative law judge shall be in accordance with subparts C through E of this part. After referral of the petition for modification and application for temporary relief, no further decision shall be rendered by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Duration of relief.</E> An order granting temporary relief shall be effective until superseded by the Administrator's proposed decision and order, unless a hearing is requested in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. If such hearing is requested, the temporary relief shall remain in effect until modified, affirmed or set aside by the presiding administrative law judge. <PRTPAGE P="215"/>In no case, however, shall the Administrator's order remain in effect for more than one year, unless renewed or affirmed by the presiding administrative law judge.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Application for relief to give effect to the proposed decision and order.</E> At any time following the proposed decision and order of the Administrator on the accompanying petition for modification, any party may request relief to give effect to the proposed decision and order until it becomes final.</P>
              <P>(l) An application for relief under paragraph (k) shall be filed with the Administrator and shall include a good faith representation that no party is expected to contest the granting of the petition for modification.</P>
              <P>(m) A decision to grant relief requested under paragraph (k) will take effect on the seventh day following the decision. If a request for hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed in accordance with § 44.14 prior to the seventh day following the granting of such relief, the relief will not become effective. If such request for hearing on the proposed decision and order is filed after relief becomes effective, the relief will expire immediately.</P>

              <P>(a) Any party may, at least 20 days before the date fixed for any hearing under Subpart C of this part, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary decision on all or any part of the proceeding. Any other party may, within 10 days after service of the motion, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision.

When a motion for summary decision is made and supported as provided in this section, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of such pleading. Such response must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) The administrative law judge may grant the motion if the pleadings, affidavits, material obtained by discovery or otherwise, or matters officially noticed show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and a party is entitled to summary decision. The administrative law judge may deny the motion whenever the moving party denies access to information by means of discovery to a party opposing the motion.</P>
              <P>(e) The denial of all or part of a motion for summary decision by the administrative law judge shall not be subject to interlocutory appeal to the Assistant Secretary unless the administrative law judge certifies in writing that (1) the ruling involves an important question of law or policy as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion, and (2) an immediate appeal from the ruling may materially advance termination of the proceeding. The allowance of an interlocutory appeal shall not stay the proceedings before the administrative law judge unless ordered by the Assistant Secretary.</P>

If a request for hearing is filed, the amended proposed decision and order shall be subject to all procedures of subparts C through E of this part as if it were a proposed decision and order of the Administrator issued in accordance with § 44.13. The original modification shall remain in effect until superseded by a final amended modification.</P>

              <P>(c) In cases where the original decision and order was based upon an alternative method of achieving the result of the standard, the amended decision and order shall at all times provide to miners at the mine at least the same measure of protection afforded to the miners at the mine by such standard. In cases where the original decision and order was based upon a diminution of safety to the miners resulting from application of the standard at such time, the amended decision and order <PRTPAGE P="222"/>shall not reduce the protection afforded miners by the original decision and order.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 49.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Availability of mine rescue teams.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except where alternative compliance is permitted for small and remote mines (§ 49.3) or those mines operating under special mining conditions (§ 49.4), every operator of an underground mine shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Establish at least two mine rescue teams which are available at all times when miners are underground; or</P>
              <P>(2) Enter into an arrangement for mine rescue services which assures that at least two mine rescue teams are available at all times when miners are underground.</P>
              <P>(b) Each mine rescue team shall consist of five members and one alternate, who are fully qualified, trained, and equipped for providing emergency mine rescue service.</P>

              <P>(c) To be considered for membership on a mine rescue team, each person <PRTPAGE P="261"/>must have been employed in an underground mine for a minimum of one year within the past five years. For the purpose of mine rescue work only, miners who are employed on the surface but work regularly underground shall meet the experience requirement. The underground experience requirement is waived for those miners on a mine rescue team on the effective date of this rule.</P>
              <P>(d) Each operator shall arrange, in advance, ground transportation for rescue teams and equipment to the mine or mines served.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon the effective date of this part, the required rescue capability shall be present at all existing underground mines, upon initial excavation of a new underground mine entrance, or the re-opening of an existing underground mine.</P>
              <P>(f) Except where alternative compliance is permitted under § 49.3 or § 49.4, no mine served by a mine rescue team shall be located more than two hours ground travel time from the mine rescue station with which the rescue team is associated.</P>
              <P>(g) As used in this part, mine rescue teams shall be considered available where teams are capable presenting themselves at the mine site(s) within a reasonable time after notification of an occurrence which might require their services. Rescue team members will be considered available even though performing regular work duties or in an off-duty capacity. The requirement that mine rescue teams be available shall not apply when teams are participating in mine rescue contests or providing services to another mine.</P>
              <P>(h) Each operator of an underground mine who provides rescue teams under this section shall send the District Manager a statement describing the mine's method of compliance with this part. The statement shall disclose whether the operator has independently provided mine rescue teams or entered into an agreement for the services of mine rescue teams. The name of the provider and the location of the services shall be included in the statement. A copy of the statement shall be posted at the mine for the miners' information. Where a miners' representative has been designated, the operator shall also provide the representative with a copy of the statement.</P>

              <P>(3) Whether the alternative mine rescue plan provides a suitable rescue capability at the operator's mine.</P>
              <P>(f) Where alternative compliance is approved by MSHA, the operator shall adopt the alternative plan and post a copy of the approved plan (with appropriate MSHA mine emergency telephone numbers) at the mine for the miners' information. Where a miners' representative has been designated, the operator shall also provide the representative with a copy of the approved plan.</P>
              <P>(g) The operator shall notify the District Manager of any changed condition or factor materially affecting information submitted in the application for alternative mine rescue capability.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) An approved plan for alternative mine rescue capability shall be subject to revocation or modification for cause by MSHA, where it is determined that a condition or factor has changed which would materially alter the operator's mine rescue capability. If such action is contemplated, the operator will be notified, and given an opportunity to be heard before the appropriate District Manager.</P>
              <P>(2) If an application for alternative compliance is denied or revoked, the District Manager shall provide the reason for such denial or revocation in writing to the operator. The operator may appeal this decision in writing to the Administrator for Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health, 201 12th Street South, Arlington, VA 22202-5452.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This part 50 implements sections 103(e) and 111 of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. 801 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and sections 4 and 13 of the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act, 30 U.S.C. 721 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and applies to operators of coal, metal, and nonmetallic mines. It requires operators to immediately notify the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of accidents, requires operators to investigate accidents, and restricts disturbance of accident related areas. This part also requires operators to file reports pertaining to accidents, occupational injuries and occupational illnesses, as well as employment and coal production data, with MSHA, and requires operators to maintain copies of reports at relevant mine offices. The purpose of this part is to implement MSHA's authority to investigate, and to obtain and utilize information pertaining to, accidents, injuries, and illnesses occurring or originating in mines. In utilizing information received under part 50, MSHA will develop rates of injury occurrence (incident rates or IR), on the basis of 200,000 hours of employee exposure (equivalent to 100 employees working 2,000 hours per year). The incidence rate for a particular injury category will be based on the formula:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">IR = (number of cases × 200,000) divided by hours of employee exposure.</FP>
              
              <FP>MSHA will develop data respecting injury severity using days away from work or days of restricted work activity and the 200,000 hour base as criteria. The severity measure (SM) for a particular injury category will be based on the formula:</FP>
              
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">SM = (sum of days × 200,000) divided by hours of employee exposure.</FP>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria—Differences between medical treatment and first aid.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Medical treatment includes, but is not limited to, the suturing of any wound, treatment of fractures, application of a cast or other professional means of immobilizing an injured part of the body, treatment of infection arising out of an injury, treatment of bruise by the drainage of blood, surgical removal of dead or damaged skin (debridement), amputation or permanent loss of use of any part of the body, treatment of second and third degree burns. Procedures which are diagnostic in nature are not considered by themselves to constitute medical treatments. Visits to a physician, physical examinations, X-ray examinations, and hospitalization for observations, where no evidence of injury or illness is found and no medical treatment given, do not in themselves constitute medical treatment. Procedures which are preventive in nature also are not considered by themselves to constitute medical treatment. Tetanus and flu shots are considered preventative in nature. First aid includes any one-time treatment, and follow-up visit for the purpose of observation, of minor injuries such as, cuts, scratches, first degree <PRTPAGE P="278"/>burns and splinters. Ointments, salves, antiseptics, and dressings to minor injuries are considered to be first aid.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Abrasion.</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning a wound, soaking, applying antiseptic and nonprescription medication and bandages on the first visit and follow-up visits limited to observation including changing dressing and bandages. Additional cleaning and application of antiseptic constitutes first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment includes examination for removal of imbedded foreign material, multiple soakings, whirlpool treatment, treatment of infection, or other professional treatments and any treatment involving more than a minor spot-type injury. Treatment of abrasions occurring to greater than full skin depth is considered medical treatment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Bruises.</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to a single soaking or application of cold compresses, and follow-up visits if they are limited only to observation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment includes multiple soakings, draining of collected blood, or other treatment beyond observation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Burns, Thermal and Chemical (resulting in destruction of tissue by direct contact).</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning or flushing the surface, soaking, applying cold compresses, antiseptics or nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit, and follow-up visits restricted to observation, changing bandages, or additional cleaning. Most first degree burns are amenable to first aid treatment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment includes a series of treatments including soaks, whirlpool, skin grafts, and surgical debridement (cutting away dead skin). Most second and third degree burns require medical treatment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Cuts and Lacerations.</E> (i) First aid treatment is the same as for abrasions except the application of butterfly closures for cosmetic purposes only can be considered first aid.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment includes the application of butterfly closures for non-cosmetic purposes, sutures, (stitches), surgical debridement, treatment of infection, or other professional treatment.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Eye Injuries.</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to irrigation, removal of foreign material not imbedded in eye, and application of nonprescription medications. A precautionary visit (special examination) to a physician is considered as first aid if treatment is limited to above items, and follow-up visits if they are limited to observation only.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment cases involve removal of imbedded foreign objects, use of prescription medications, or other professional treatment.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Inhalation of Toxic or Corrosive Gases.</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to removal of the miner to fresh air or the one-time administration of oxygen for several minutes.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment consists of any professional treatment beyond that mentioned under first aid and all cases involving loss of consciousness.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Foreign Objects.</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning the wound, removal of any foreign object by tweezers or other simple techniques, application of antiseptics and nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit. Follow-up visits are limited to observation including changing of bandages. Additional cleaning and applications of antiseptic constitute first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment consists of removal of any foreign object by physician due to depth of imbedment, size or shape of object, or location of wound. Treatment for infection, treatment of a reaction to tetanus booster, or other professional treatment, is considered medical treatment.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Sprains and Strains.</E> (i) First aid treatment is limited to soaking, application of cold compresses, and use of elastic bandages on the first visit. Follow-up visits for observation, including reapplying bandage, are first aid.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical treatment includes a series of hot and cold soaks, use of whirlpools, diathermy treatment, or other professional treatment.</P>

If you have personnel working at the surface of your underground mine, report data for those persons on the second line;</P>
              <P>(ii) Surface Mine (Including Shops and Yards): Report on the appropriate line, employment and coal production for the mining operation. For surface mining sub-units 03, 04, 05 and 06, include all work associated with shops and yards;</P>

              <P>(iii) Mill Operations, Preparation Plants, Breakers: Report data on all persons employed at your milling (crushing, sizing, grinding, concentrating, etc.) operation, preparation plant, or breaker, including those working in associated shops and yards. (Do not include personnel reported in <PRTPAGE P="283"/>shops and yards associated with other sub-units.);</P>
              <P>(iv) Office: Include in this category employees who work principally at the mine or preparation facility office.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Average number of persons working during quarter:</E> Show the average number of employees on the payroll during all active periods in the quarter. Include all classes of employees (supervisory, professional, technical proprietors, owners, operators, partners, and service personnel) on your payroll, full or part-time, Report Each Employee Under One Activity Only. For example: If one or more persons work both in the mine and the mill, report these employees under the activity where they spend most of their time. If necessary, estimate for the major activity. The average number may be computed by adding together the number of employees working during each pay period and then dividing by the number of pay periods. Do not include pay periods where no one worked. For example, during the quarter you had 5 pay periods where employees worked. The number of employees in each pay period was 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively. To compute the average, add the number of employees working each pay period (10 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 64). Then divide by the number of pay periods (64 divided by 5 = 12.8). Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 13 as the average number of persons working.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Total employee-hours worked during the quarter:</E> Show the total hours worked by all employees during the quarter covered. Include all time where the employee was actually on duty, but exclude vacation, holiday, sick leave, and all other off-duty time, even though paid for. Make certain that each overtime hour is reported as one hour, and not as the overtime pay multiple for an hour of work. The hours reported should be obtained from payroll or other time records. If actual hours are not available, they may be estimated on the basis of scheduled hours. Make certain not to include hours paid but not worked.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Production of clean coal (short tons):</E> This section is to be compiled only by operators of underground or surface mines, but not by operators of central or independent coal preparation plants or operators of metal or nonmetal mines. Enter the total production of clean coal from the mine. This must include coal shipped from the mine and coal used for fuel at the mine, but exclude refuse and coal produced at another mine and purchased for use at the mine.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Other Reportable Data.</E> Indicate the number of reportable injuries or illnesses occurring at your operation during the quarter covered by this report.

                <P>(i) Equipment capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour shall be tested with a typical load for that particular piece of equipment. Front-end loaders shall be tested with the loader bucket empty. Equipment shall not be tested when carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives.</P>
                <P>(ii) The approach shall be sufficient length to allow the equipment operator to reach and maintain a constant speed between 10 and 20 miles per hour prior to entering the 100 foot measured area. The constant speed shall be maintained up to the point when the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the brakes. The roadway shall be wide enought to accommodate the size of the equipment being tested. The ground shall be generally level, packed, and dry in the braking portion of the test course. Ground moisture may be present to the extent that it does not adversely affect the braking surface.</P>
                <P>(iii) Braking is to be performed using only those braking systems, including auxiliary retarders, which are designed to bring the equipment to a stop under normal operating conditions. Parking or emergency (secondary) brakes are not to be actuated during the test.</P>
                <P>(iv) The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriate for the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which is designed for the power train to be disengaged during braking.</P>
                <P>(v) Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximum of 20 miles per hour.</P>
                <P>(vi) Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stopped position.</P>
                <P>(4) Test results shall be evaluated as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does not exceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be considered valid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateral motion during the braking portion of the test.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initial test run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additional test runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment does not exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additional tests.</P>
                <P>(5) Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipment is not capable or traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake tests will not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will rely upon other available evidence to determine whether the service brake system meets the performance requirement of this standard.</P>

                <P>(a) A miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 308 micrograms of elemental carbon per cubic meter of air (308<E T="52">EC</E> µg/m<SU>3</SU>). [This interim permissible exposure limit (PEL) remains in effect until the final DPM exposure limit becomes effective. When the final DPM exposure limit becomes effective, MSHA will publish a document in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>]</P>

                <P>(b)(1) Effective May 20, 2006, a miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 308 micrograms of elemental carbon per cubic meter of air (308<E T="52">EC</E> µg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>

                <P>(2) Effective January 20, 2007, a miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 350 micrograms of total carbon per cubic meter of air (350<E T="52">TC</E> µg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>

                <P>(3) Effective May 20, 2008, a miner's personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 160 micrograms of total carbon per cubic meter of air (160<E T="52">TC</E> µg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>
                <P>(c)(1) If a mine requires additional time to come into compliance with the final DPM limit established in § 57.5060 (b) due to technological or economic constraints, the operator of the mine may file an application with the District Manager for a special extension.</P>
                <P>(2) The mine operator must certify on the application that the operator has posted one copy of the application at the mine site for at least 30 days prior to the date of application, and has provided another copy to the authorized representative of miners.</P>
                <P>(3) No approval of a special extension shall exceed a period of one year from the date of approval. Mine operators may file for additional special extensions provided each extension does not exceed a period of one year. An application must include the following information:</P>
                <P>(i) Documentation supporting that controls are technologically or economically infeasible at this time to reduce the miner's exposure to the final DPM limit.</P>
                <P>(ii) The most recent DPM monitoring results.</P>
                <P>(iii) The actions the operator will take during the extension to minimize exposure of miners to DPM.</P>

                <P>(4) A mine operator must comply with the terms of any approved application for a special extension, post a copy of the approved application for a special extension at the mine site for the duration of the special extension <PRTPAGE P="373"/>period, and provide a copy of the approved application to the authorized representative of miners.</P>
                <P>(d) The mine operator must install, use, and maintain feasible engineering and administrative controls to reduce a miner's exposure to or below the applicable DPM PEL established in this section. When controls do not reduce a miner's DPM exposure to the PEL, controls are infeasible, or controls do not produce significant reductions in DPM exposures, controls must be used to reduce the miner's exposure to as low a level as feasible and must be supplemented with respiratory protection in accordance with § 57.5005(a), (b), and paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Air purifying respirators must be equipped with the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Filters certified by NIOSH under 30 CFR part 11 (appearing in the July 1, 1994 edition of 30 CFR, parts 1 to 199) as a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter;</P>
                <P>(ii) Filters certified by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 as 99.97% efficient; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Filters certified by NIOSH for DPM.</P>
                <P>(2) Non-powered, negative-pressure, air purifying, particulate-filter respirators shall use an R- or P-series filter or any filter certified by NIOSH for DPM. An R-series filter shall not be used for longer than one work shift.</P>
                <P>(3) The mine operator must provide a confidential medical evaluation by a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP), at no cost to the miner, to determine the miner's ability to use a respirator before the miner is required to be fit tested or to use a respirator at the mine. If the PLHCP determines that the miner cannot wear a negative pressure respirator, the mine operator must make certain that the PLHCP evaluates the miner's ability to wear a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR).</P>
                <P>(4) The mine operator must provide the miner with an opportunity to discuss their evaluation results with the PLHCP before the PLHCP submits the written determination to the mine operator regarding the miner's ability to wear a respirator. If the miner disagrees with the evaluation results of the PLHCP, the miner may submit within 30 days additional evidence of his or her medical condition to the PLHCP.</P>
                <P>(5) The mine operator must obtain a written determination from the PLHCP regarding the miner's ability to wear a respirator, and the mine operator must assure that the PLHCP provides a copy of the determination to the miner.</P>
                <P>(6) The miner must be reevaluated when the mine operator has reason to believe that conditions have changed which could adversely affect the miner's ability to wear the respirator.</P>
                <P>(7) Upon written notification that the PLHCP has determined that the miner is unable to wear a respirator, including a PAPR, the miner must be transferred to work in an existing position in an area of the same mine where respiratory protection is not required. The miner must be transferred within 30 days of the final determination by the PLHCP.</P>
                <P>(i) The miner must continue to receive compensation at no less than the regular rate of pay in the classification held by that miner immediately prior to the transfer.</P>
                <P>(ii) Increases in wages of the transferred miner must be based upon the new work classification.</P>
                <P>(8) The mine operator must maintain a record of the identity of the PLHCP and the most recent written determination of each miner's ability to wear a respirator for the duration of the miner's employment plus six months.</P>
                <P>(e) Rotation of miners shall not be considered an acceptable administrative control used for compliance with the DPM standard.</P>

                <P>(a) Any diesel powered equipment operated at any time in underground areas must meet the following maintenance standards:</P>
                <P>(1) The operator must maintain any approved engine in approved condition;</P>
                <P>(2) The operator must maintain the emission related components of any non-approved engine to manufacturer specifications; and</P>
                <P>(3) The operator must maintain any emission or particulate control device installed on the equipment in effective operating condition.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) A mine operator must authorize each miner operating diesel-powered equipment underground to affix a visible and dated tag to the equipment when the miner notes evidence that the equipment may require maintenance in order to comply with the maintenance standards of paragraph (a) of this section. The term <E T="03">evidence</E> means visible smoke or odor that is unusual for that piece of equipment under normal operating procedures, or obvious or visible defects in the exhaust emissions control system or in the engine affecting emissions.</P>

                <P>(2) A mine operator must ensure that any equipment tagged pursuant to this section is promptly examined by a person authorized to maintain diesel equipment, and that the affixed tag not be removed until the examination has been completed. The term <E T="03">promptly</E> means before the end of the next shift during which a qualified mechanic is scheduled to work.</P>
                <P>(3) A mine operator must retain a log of any equipment tagged pursuant to this section. The log must include the date the equipment is tagged, the date the equipment is examined, the name of the person examining the equipment, and any action taken as a result of the examination. The operator must retain the information in the log for one year after the date the tagged equipment was examined.</P>
                <P>(c) Persons authorized by a mine operator to maintain diesel equipment covered by paragraph (a) of this section must be qualified, by virtue of training or experience, to ensure that the maintenance standards of paragraph (a) of this section are observed. An operator must retain appropriate evidence of the competence of any person to perform specific maintenance tasks in compliance with those standards for one year after the date of any maintenance, and upon request must provide the documentation to the authorized representative of the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(3) Service brake tests shall be conducted under the direction of the mine operator in cooperation with and according to the instructions provided by the MSHA inspector as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Equipment capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour shall be tested with a typical load for that particular piece of equipment. Front-end loaders shall be tested with the loader bucket empty. Equipment shall not be tested when carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives.</P>
                <P>(ii) The approach shall be of sufficient length to allow the equipment operator to reach and maintain a constant speed between 10 and 20 miles per hour prior to entering the 100 foot measured area. The constant speed shall be maintained up to the point when the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the brakes. The roadway shall be wide enough to accommodate the size of the equipment being tested. The ground shall be generally level, packed, and dry in the braking portion of the test course. Ground moisture may be present to the extent that it does not adversely affect the braking surface.</P>
                <P>(iii) Braking is to be performed using only those braking systems, including auxiliary retarders, which are designed to bring the equipment to a stop under normal operating conditions. Parking or emergency (secondary) brakes are not to be actuated during the test.</P>
                <P>(iv) The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriate for the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which is designed for the power train to be disengaged during braking.</P>

                <P>(v) Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximum of 20 miles per hour.<PRTPAGE P="406"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vi) Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stopped position.</P>
                <P>(4) Test results shall be evaluated as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does not exceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be considered valid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateral motion during the braking portion of the test.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initial test run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additional test runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment does not exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additional tests.</P>
                <P>(5) Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipment is not capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake tests will not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will rely upon other available evidence to determine whether the service brake system meets the performance requirements of this standard.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Revised baseline audiogram.</E> An annual audiogram designated to be used in lieu of a miner's original baseline audiogram in measuring changes in hearing sensitivity as a result of the circumstances set forth in §§ 62.170(c)(1) or 62.170(c)(2) of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Noise exposure assessment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The mine operator must establish a system of monitoring that evaluates each miner's noise exposure sufficiently to determine continuing compliance with this part.</P>

            <P>(b) The mine operator must determine a miner's noise dose (D, in percent) by using a noise dosimeter or by computing the formula: D = 100(C<E T="52">1</E>/T<E T="52">1</E> + C<E T="52">2</E>/T<E T="52">2</E> + . . . . + C<E T="52">n</E>/T<E T="52">n</E>), where Cn is the total time the miner is exposed at a specified sound level, and T<E T="52">n</E> is the reference duration of exposure at that sound level shown in Table 62-1.</P>

            <P>(1) The mine operator must use Table 62-2 when converting from dose readings to equivalent TWA<E T="52">8</E> readings.</P>
            <P>(2) A miner's noise dose determination must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be made without adjustment for the use of any hearing protector;</P>
            <P>(ii) Integrate all sound levels over the appropriate range;</P>
            <P>(iii) Reflect the miner's full work shift;</P>
            <P>(iv) Use a 90-dB criterion level and a 5-dB exchange rate; and</P>
            <P>(v) Use the A-weighting and slow response instrument settings.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Observation of monitoring.</E> The mine operator must provide affected miners and their representatives with an opportunity to observe noise exposure monitoring required by this section and must give prior notice of the date and time of intended exposure monitoring to affected miners and their representatives.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Miner notification.</E> The mine operator must notify a miner of his or her exposure when the miner's exposure is determined to equal or exceed the action level, exceed the permissible exposure level, or exceed the dual hearing protection level, provided the mine operator has not notified the miner of an exposure at such level within the prior 12 months. The mine operator must base the notification on an exposure evaluation conducted either by the mine operator or by an authorized representative of the Secretary of Labor. The mine operator must notify the miner in writing within 15 calendar days of:</P>
            <P>(1) The exposure determination; and (2) the corrective action being taken.</P>
            <P>(e) The mine operator must maintain a copy of any such miner notification, or a list on which the relevant information about that miner's notice is recorded, for the duration of the affected miner's exposure at or above the action level and for at least 6 months thereafter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Permissible exposure level.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The mine operator must assure that no miner is exposed during any work shift to noise that exceeds the permissible exposure level. If during any work shift a miner's noise exposure exceeds the permissible exposure level, the mine operator must use all feasible engineering and administrative controls to reduce the miner's noise exposure to the permissible exposure level, and enroll the miner in a hearing conservation program that complies with § 62.150 of this part. When a mine operator uses administrative controls to reduce a miner's exposure, the mine operator must post the procedures for such controls on the mine bulletin board and provide a copy to the affected miner.</P>
            <P>(b) If a miner's noise exposure continues to exceed the permissible exposure level despite the use of all feasible engineering and administrative controls, the mine operator must continue to use the engineering and administrative controls to reduce the miner's noise exposure to as low a level as is feasible.</P>
            <P>(c) The mine operator must assure that no miner is exposed at any time to sound levels exceeding 115 dBA, as determined without adjustment for the use of any hearing protector.</P>

            <P>The mine operator must provide audiometric tests to satisfy the requirements of this part at no cost to the miner. A physician or an audiologist, or a qualified technician under the direction or supervision of a physician or an audiologist must conduct the tests.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Baseline audiogram.</E> The mine operator must offer miners the opportunity for audiometric testing of the miner's hearing sensitivity for the purpose of establishing a valid baseline audiogram to compare with subsequent annual audiograms. The mine operator may use an existing audiogram of the miner's hearing sensitivity as the baseline audiogram if it meets the audiometric testing requirements of § 62.171 of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) The mine operator must offer and provide within 6 months of enrolling the miner in a hearing conservation program, audiometric testing which results in a valid baseline audiogram, or offer and provide the testing within 12 months where the operator uses mobile test vans to do the testing.</P>
            <P>(2) The mine operator must notify the miner to avoid high levels of noise for at least 14 hours immediately preceding the baseline audiogram. The mine operator must not expose the miner to workplace noise for the 14-hour quiet period before conducting the audiometric testing to determine a baseline audiogram. The operator may substitute the use of hearing protectors for this quiet period.</P>
            <P>(3) The mine operator must not establish a new baseline audiogram or a new revised baseline audiogram, where one has been established, due to changes in enrollment status in the hearing conservation program.

            <P>(i) Determine if the audiogram is valid; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Determine if a standard threshold shift or a reportable hearing loss, as defined in this part, has occurred.</P>
            <P>(3) Instruct the physician, audiologist, or qualified technician not to reveal to the mine operator, without the written consent of the miner, any specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to the miner's hearing loss due to occupational noise or the wearing of hearing protectors; and</P>
            <P>(4) Obtain the results and the interpretation of the results of audiograms conducted under this part within 30 calendar days of conducting the audiogram.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The mine operator must provide an audiometric retest within 30 calendar days of receiving a determination that an audiogram is invalid, provided any medical pathology has improved to the point that a valid audiogram may be obtained.</P>
            <P>(2) If an annual audiogram demonstrates that the miner has incurred a standard threshold shift or reportable hearing loss, the mine operator may provide one retest within 30 calendar days of receiving the results of the audiogram and may use the results of the retest as the annual audiogram.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining whether a standard threshold shift or reportable hearing loss has occurred, allowance may be made for the contribution of aging (presbycusis) to the change in hearing level.

            <P>(iii) Subtracting the values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section from the values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The differences calculated represent that portion of the change in hearing that may be due to aging.</P>
            <P>(2) Subtract the values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section from the hearing threshold levels found in the annual audiogram to obtain the adjusted annual audiogram hearing threshold levels.</P>
            <P>(3) Subtract the hearing threshold levels in the baseline audiogram or revised baseline audiogram from the adjusted annual audiogram hearing threshold levels determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the age-corrected threshold shifts.</P>

                <P>Assume the sampled MMU or DA is on a 1.5-mg/m<SU>3</SU> dust standard. Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent concentration of 1.12 mg/m<SU>3</SU> contains 12.3% of quartz dust, which corresponds to a quartz concentration of 138 µg/m<SU>3</SU>. Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that MMU or DA shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.8 mg/m<SU>3</SU> (10/12.3% = 0.8 mg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>

              <P>(b) Only an approved CMDPSU shall be used to take bimonthly samples of the concentration of respirable coal mine dust from each designated area (DA) as required by this part until January 31, 2016. On February 1, 2016:</P>
              <P>(1) DAs associated with an MMU shall be redesignated as Other Designated Occupations (ODO). ODOs shall be sampled quarterly with an approved CPDM as required by this part and an approved CMDPSU shall not be used, unless notified by the Secretary to continue to use an approved CMDPSU to conduct quarterly sampling.</P>

              <P>(2) DAs identified by the operator under § 75.371(t) of this chapter shall be sampled quarterly with an approved CMDPSU as required by this part, unless the operator notifies the District Manager in writing that only an approved CPDM will be used for all DA sampling at the mine. The notification must be received at least 90 days before <PRTPAGE P="455"/>the beginning of the quarter in which CPDMs will be used to collect the DA samples.</P>
              <P>(c) Sampling devices shall be worn or carried directly to the MMU or DA to be sampled and from the MMU or DA sampled and shall be operated portal-to-portal. Sampling devices shall remain with the occupation or DA being sampled and shall be operational during the entire shift, which includes the total time spent in the MMU or DA and while traveling to and from the mining section or area being sampled.

              <P>(2) Remain plugged at all times;</P>
              <P>(3) Be used for the same amount of time, and exposed to the same temperature and handling conditions as the filters used for sampling;</P>
              <P>(4) Be kept with the exposed samples after sampling and in the same mailing container when transmitted to MSHA.</P>
              <P>(e) Records showing the length of each production shift for each MMU shall be made and retained for at least six months and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners, and submitted to the District Manager when requested in writing.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon request from the District Manager, the operator shall submit the date and time any respirable dust sampling required by this part will begin. This information shall be submitted at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled sampling.</P>
              <P>(g) To establish a normal production shift, the operator shall record the amount of run-of-mine material produced by each MMU during each shift to determine the average production for the most recent 30 production shifts, or for all production shifts if fewer than 30 shifts of production data are available. Production records shall be retained for at least six months and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.</P>
              <P>(h) Operators using CPDMs shall provide training to all miners expected to wear a CPDM. The training shall be completed prior to a miner wearing a CPDM and then every 12 months thereafter. The training shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The importance of monitoring dust concentrations and properly wearing the CPDM.</P>
              <P>(2) Explaining the basic features and capabilities of the CPDM;</P>
              <P>(3) Discussing the various types of information displayed by the CPDM and how to access that information; and</P>
              <P>(4) How to start and stop a short-term sample run during compliance sampling.</P>
              <P>(i) An operator shall keep a record of the CPDM training at the mine site for 24 months after completion of the training. An operator may keep the record elsewhere if the record is immediately accessible from the mine site by electronic transmission. Upon request from an authorized representative of the Secretary, Secretary of HHS, or representative of miners, the operator shall promptly provide access to any such training records. The record shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The date of training;</P>
              <P>(2) The names of miners trained; and</P>
              <P>(3) The subjects included in the training.</P>
              <P>(j) An anthracite mine using the full box, open breast, or slant breast mining method may use either a CPDM or a CMDPSU to conduct the required sampling. The mine operator shall notify the District Manager in writing of its decision to not use a CPDM.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exhaust Gas Monitoring.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) During on-shift examinations required by § 75.362, a certified person as defined by § 75.100 of this chapter and designated by the operator as trained or experienced in the appropriate sampling procedures, shall determine the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<E T="52">2</E>):</P>
              <P>(1) In the return of each working section where diesel equipment is used, at a location which represents the contribution of all diesel equipment on such section;</P>
              <P>(2) In the area of the section loading point if diesel haulage equipment is operated on the working section;</P>
              <P>(3) At a point inby the last piece of diesel equipment on the longwall or shortwall face when mining equipment is being installed or removed; and</P>
              <P>(4) In any other area designated by the district manager as specified in the mine operator's approved ventilation plan where diesel equipment is operated in a manner which can result in significant concentrations of diesel exhaust.</P>
              <P>(b) Samples of CO and NO<E T="52">2</E> shall be—</P>
              <P>(1) Collected in a manner that makes the results available immediately to the person collecting the samples;</P>
              <P>(2) Collected and analyzed by appropriate instrumentation which has been maintained and calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations; and</P>

              <P>(3) Collected during periods that are representative of conditions during normal operations.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
              </P>

              <P>(c) Except as provided in § 75.325(j) of this chapter, when sampling results indicate a concentration of CO and/or NO<E T="52">2</E> exceeding an action level of 50 percent of the threshold limit values (TLV®) adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, the mine operator shall immediately take appropriate corrective action to reduce the concentrations of CO and/or NO<E T="52">2</E> to below the applicable action level.

              <SUBJECT>Respirable dust standard when quartz is present.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable quartz dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed at or below 0.1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> (100 micrograms per cubic meter or µg/m<SU>3</SU>) as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration.</P>

              <P>(b) When the equivalent concentration of respirable quartz dust exceeds 100 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which <PRTPAGE P="469"/>each miner in the active workings is exposed as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration at or below the applicable standard. The applicable standard is computed by dividing the percent of quartz into the number 10. The application of this formula shall not result in the applicable standard that exceeds the standard established by § 71.100(a) of this section.</P>
              <P>Example: Assume the sampled DWP is on a 1.5-mg/m<SU>3</SU> dust standard. Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent concentration of 1.09 mg/m<SU>3</SU> contains 16.7% of quartz dust, which corresponds to a quartz concentration of 182 µg/m<SU>3</SU>. Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that DWP shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.6 mg/m<SU>3</SU> (10/16.7% = 0.6 mg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>

              <P>(a) Each operator shall take representative samples of the concentration of respirable dust in the active workings of the mine as required by this part only with an approved CMDPSU. On February 1, 2016, the operator may use an approved CPDM if the operator notifies the District Manager in writing that only an approved CPDM will be used for all DWP sampling at the mine. The notification must be received at least 90 days before the beginning of the quarter in which CPDMs will be used to collect the DWP samples.</P>
              <P>(b) Sampling devices shall be worn or carried directly to and from the DWP to be sampled. Sampling devices shall remain with the DWP and shall be operational during the entire shift, which includes the total time spent in the DWP and while traveling to and from the DWP being sampled. If the work shift to be sampled is longer than 12 hours and the sampling device is:</P>
              <P>(1) A CMDPSU, the operator shall switch-out the unit's sampling pump prior to the 13th-hour of operation.</P>
              <P>(2) A CPDM, the operator shall switch-out the CPDM with a fully charged device prior to the 13th-hour of operation.</P>

              <P>(4) Be kept with the exposed samples after sampling and in the same mailing container when transmitted to MSHA.</P>
              <P>(d) Records showing the length of each normal work shift for each DWP shall be made and retained for at least six months and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners, and submitted to the District Manager when requested in writing.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon request from the District Manager, the operator shall submit the date and time any respirable dust sampling required by this part will begin. This information shall be submitted at least 48 hours prior to scheduled sampling.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon written request by the operator, the District Manager may waive the rain restriction for a normal work shift as defined in § 71.2 for a period not to exceed two months, if the District Manager determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The operator will not have reasonable opportunity to complete the respirable dust sampling required by this part without the waiver because of the frequency of rain; and</P>
              <P>(2) The operator did not have reasonable opportunity to complete the respirable dust sampling required by this part prior to requesting the waiver.</P>

              <P>(4) How to start and stop a short-term sample run during compliance sampling.</P>
              <P>(h) An operator shall keep a record of the CPDM training at the mine site for 24 months after completion of the training. An operator may keep the record elsewhere if the record is immediately accessible from the mine site by electronic transmission. Upon request from an authorized representative of the Secretary, Secretary of HHS, or representative of miners, the operator shall promptly provide access to any such training records. The record shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The date of training;</P>

              <P>(a) Approved sampling devices shall be maintained as approved under part 74 of this chapter and calibrated in accordance with MSHA Informational Report IR 1240 (1996) “Calibration and Maintenance Procedures for Coal Mine Respirable Dust Samplers” or in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations if using a CPDM. Only persons certified in maintenance and calibration can perform maintenance work on the CPDM or on the pump unit of the CMDPSU.</P>
              <P>(b) Sampling devices shall be calibrated at the flowrate of 2.0 liters of air per minute (L/min) if using a CMDPSU, or at 2.2 L/min if using a CPDM, or at a different flowrate recommended by the manufacturer, before they are put into service and, thereafter, at time intervals recommended by the manufacturer or prescribed by the Secretary or Secretary of HHS.</P>
              <P>(c) If using a CMDPSU, sampling devices shall be examined and tested by a person certified in sampling or in maintenance and calibration within 3 hours before the start of the shift on which the approved sampling devices will be used to collect respirable dust samples. This is to assure that the sampling devices are clean and in proper working condition. This examination and testing shall include the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Examination of all components of the cyclone assembly to assure that they are clean and free of dust and dirt. This includes examining the interior of the connector barrel (located between <PRTPAGE P="471"/>the cassette assembly and vortex finder), vortex finder, cyclone body, and grit pot;</P>
              <P>(2) Examination of the inner surface of the cyclone body to assure that it is free of scoring or scratch marks on the inner surface of the cyclone where the air flow is directed by the vortex finder into the cyclone body;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> Asbestos is a generic term for a number of asbestiform hydrated silicates that, when crushed or processed, separate into flexible fibers made up of fibrils.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Asbestos</E> means chrysotile, cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos (amosite), crocidolite, anthophylite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite asbestos.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Asbestos fiber</E> means a fiber of asbestos that meets the criteria of a fiber.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fiber</E> means a particle longer than 5 micrometers (µm) with a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 3-to-1.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)</E>—(1) <E T="03">Full-shift limit.</E> A miner's personal exposure to asbestos shall not exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average full-shift airborne concentration of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Excursion limit.</E> No miner shall be exposed at any time to airborne concentrations of asbestos in excess of 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Measurement of airborne asbestos fiber concentration.</E> Potential asbestos fiber concentration shall be determined by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) using the OSHA Reference Method in OSHA's asbestos standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1001, Appendix A, or a method at least equivalent to that method in identifying a potential asbestos exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit. When PCM results indicate a potential exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit, samples shall be further analyzed using transmission electron microscopy according to NIOSH Method 7402 or a method at least equivalent to that method.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Accuracy.</E> The ability of a CPDM to determine the true concentration of respirable coal mine dust at the end of a shift shall be established through testing that demonstrates the following:</P>

              <P>(1) For full-shift measurements of 8 hours or more, a 95 percent confidence that the recorded measurements are <PRTPAGE P="492"/>within ±25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over a concentration range from 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m<SU>3</SU>; and</P>
              <P>(2) For intra-shift measurements of less than 8 hours, a 95 percent confidence that the recorded measurements are within ±25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over the concentration range equivalent to 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for an 8-hour period.<SU>1</SU>

                  <SU>1</SU> The equivalent dust concentration range to the 8-hour range of 0.2 − 4 mg/m<SU>3</SU> is calculated by multiplying this 8-hour range by the dividend of eight hours divided by the duration of the intrashift measurement specified in units of hours. For example, for a measurement taken at exactly one hour into the shift, the 8-hour equivalent dust concentration range would be a one-hour average concentration range of: 8 hours/1 hour × (0.2 − 4 mg/m<SU>3</SU>) = 1.6 − 32 mg/m<SU>3</SU>; for a two-hour measurement, the applicable concentration range would be calculated as: 8 hours/2 hours × (0.2 − 4 mg/m<SU>3</SU>) = 0.8 − 16 mg/m<SU>3</SU>; for a 4-hours measurement, the equivalent range would be: 0.4 − 8 mg/m<SU>3</SU>; * * * <E T="03">etc.</E> A CPDM must perform accurately, as specified, for intrashift measurements within such equivalent concentration ranges.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Precision.</E> The precision of the CPDM shall be established through testing to determine the variability of multiple measurements of the same dust concentration, as defined by the relative standard deviation of the distribution of measurements. The relative standard deviation shall be less than 0.1275 without bias for both full-shift measurements of 8 hours or more, and for intra-shift measurements of less than 8 hours within the dust concentration range equivalent to 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for an 8-hour period, as specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Bias.</E> The bias of the CPDM measurements shall be limited such that the uncorrectable discrepancy between the mean of the distribution of measurements and the true dust concentration being measured during testing shall be no greater than 10 percent. Bias must be constant over the range of dust concentration levels tested, 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for an 8-hour sampling period.</P>

              <P>(1) Carbon monoxide sensors shall be installed at the following locations:</P>
              <P>(i) Not more than 100 feet downwind of each belt drive unit, each tailpiece transfer point, and each belt take-up. If the belt drive, tailpiece, and/or take-up for a single transfer point are installed together in the same air course, and the distance between the units is less than 100 feet, they may be monitored with one sensor downwind of the last component. If the distance between the units exceeds 100 feet, additional sensors are required downwind of each belt drive unit, each tailpiece transfer point, and each belt take-up;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not more than 100 feet downwind of each section loading point;</P>
              <P>(iii) Along the belt entry so that the spacing between sensors does not exceed 1,000 feet. Where air velocities are less than 50 feet per minute, spacing must not exceed 350 feet; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The mine operator shall indicate the locations of all carbon monoxide sensors on the mine maps required by §§ 75.1200 and 75.1505 of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Where used, sensors responding to radiation, smoke, gases, or other indications of fire, shall be spaced at regular intervals to provide protection equivalent to carbon monoxide sensors, and installed within the time specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) When the distance from the tailpiece at loading points to the first outby sensor reaches the spacing requirements in § 75.1103-4(a)(1)(iii), an additional sensor shall be installed and put in operation within 24 production shift hours. When sensors of the kind described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are used, they shall be installed and put in operation within 24 production shift hours after the equivalent distance which has been established for the sensor from the tailpiece at loading points to the first outby sensor is first reached.</P>

              <P>(b) Automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall be installed so <PRTPAGE P="613"/>as to minimize the possibility of damage from roof falls and the moving belt and its load. Sensors must be installed near the center in the upper third of the entry, in a manner that does not expose personnel working on the system to unsafe conditions. Sensors must not be located in abnormally high areas or in other locations where air flow patterns do not permit products of combustion to be carried to the sensors.</P>
              <P>(c) Infrared, ultraviolet, and other sensors whose effectiveness is impaired by contamination shall be protected from dust, dirt, and moisture.</P>
              <P>(d) The voltage of automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall not exceed 120 volts.</P>
              <P>(e) Except when power must be cut off in the mine under the provisions of § 75.313, automatic fire sensor and warning device systems shall be capable of giving warning of fire for a minimum of 4 hours after the source of power to the belt is removed unless the belt haulageway is examined for hot rollers and fire as provided in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) When an unplanned removal of power from the belt occurs an examination for hot rollers and fire in the operating belts of a conveyor system shall be completed within 2 hours after the belt has stopped.</P>
              <P>(2) When a preplanned removal of power from the belt occurs an examination for hot rollers and fire on the operating belts of a conveyor system may commence not more than 30 minutes before the belts are stopped and shall be completed within 2 hours after the examination is commenced, or the examination shall be commenced when the belts are stopped and completed within 2 hours after the belts are stopped.</P>

              <P>(2) All miners in the affected areas, unless assigned emergency response duties, must be immediately withdrawn to a safe location identified in the mine emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction.</P>
              <P>(g) If the warning signal will be activated during calibration of sensors, personnel manning the surface location must be notified prior to and upon completion of calibration. Affected working sections, areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, or other areas designated in the approved emergency evacuation and firefighting program of instruction must be notified at the beginning and completion of calibration.</P>
              <P>(h) If any fire detection component becomes inoperative, immediate action must be taken to repair the component. While repairs are being made, operation of the belt may continue if the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) If one sensor becomes inoperative, a trained person must continuously monitor for carbon monoxide at the inoperative sensor;</P>
              <P>(2) If two or more adjacent sensors become inoperative, trained persons must patrol and continuously monitor the affected areas for carbon monoxide so that they will be traveled each hour in their entirety. Alternatively, a trained person must be stationed at each inoperative sensor to monitor for carbon monoxide;</P>
              <P>(3) If the complete fire detection system becomes inoperative, trained persons must patrol and continuously monitor the affected areas for carbon monoxide so that they will be traveled each hour in their entirety;</P>
              <P>(4) Trained persons who conduct monitoring under this section must have two-way voice communication capability, at intervals not to exceed 2,000 feet, and must report carbon monoxide concentrations to the surface at intervals not to exceed one hour;</P>
              <P>(5) Trained persons who conduct monitoring under this section must immediately report to the surface any concentration of carbon monoxide that reaches 10 parts per million above the established ambient level, unless the mine operator knows that the source of the carbon monoxide does not present a hazard to miners; and</P>
              <P>(6) Handheld detectors used to monitor the belt entry under this section must have a detection level equivalent to that of the system's carbon monoxide sensors.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, all self-propelled diesel-powered and electric face equipment, including shuttle cars, which is employed in the active workings of each underground coal mine on and after January 1, 1973, shall, in accordance with the schedule of time specified in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section, be equipped with substantially constructed canopies or cabs, located and installed in such a manner that when the operator is at the operating controls of such equipment he shall be protected from falls of roof, face, or rib, or from rib <PRTPAGE P="649"/>and face rolls. The requirements of this paragraph (a) shall be met as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) On and after January 1, 1974, in coal mines having mining heights of 72 inches or more;</P>
              <P>(2) On and after July 1, 1974, in coal mines having mining heights of 60 inches or more, but less than 72 inches;</P>
              <P>(3) On and after January 1, 1975, in coal mines having mining heights of 48 inches or more, but less than 60 inches;</P>
              <P>(4) On and after July 1, 1975, in coal mines having mining heights of 36 inches or more, but less than 48 inches;</P>
              <P>(5)(i) On and after January 1, 1976, in coal mines having mining heights of 30 inches or more, but less than 36 inches,</P>
              <P>(ii) On and after July 1, 1977, in coal mines having mining heights of 24 inches or more, but less than 30 inches, and</P>
              <P>(6) On and after July 1, 1978, in coal mines having mining heights of less than 24 inches.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) For purposes of this section, a canopy means a structure which provides overhead protection against falls of roof.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this section, a cab means a structure which provides overhead and lateral protection against falls of roof, rib, and face, or rib and face rolls.</P>
              <P>(c) In determining whether to install substantially constructed canopies as opposed to substantially constructed cabs, the operator shall consider and take into account the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) The mining method used;</P>
              <P>(2) Physical limitations, including but not limited to the dip of the coalbed, and roof, rib, and face conditions;</P>
              <P>(3) Previous accident experience, if any, caused by falls of roof, rib, and face, or rib and face rolls;</P>
              <P>(4) Overhead protection, such as that afforded by a substantially constructed canopy, against falls of roof will always be required; and</P>
              <P>(5) Lateral protection, such as that afforded by a substantially constructed cab, may also be necessary where the occurrence of falls of rib and face, or rib and face rolls is likely.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this section, a canopy or cab will be considered to be substantially constructed if a registered engineer certifies that such canopy or cab has the minimum structural capacity to support elastically: (1) A dead weight load of 18,000 pounds, or (2) 15 p.s.i. distributed uniformly over the plan view area of the structure, whichever is lesser.</P>
              <P>(e) Evidence of the certification required by paragraph (d) of this section shall be furnished by attaching a plate, label, or other appropriate marking to the canopy or cab for which certification has been made, stating that such canopy or cab meets the minimum requirements for structural capacity set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Written evidence of such certification shall also be retained by the operator, and shall be made available to an authorized representative of the Secretary upon request. Written evidence of certification may consist of the report of the registered engineer who certified the canopy or cab, or of information from the manufacturer of the canopy or cab stating that a registered engineer has certified that the canopy or cab meets the minimum requirements for structural capacity set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>This part 90 establishes the option of miners who are employed at coal mines and who have evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis to work in an area of a mine where the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift is continuously maintained at or below the applicable standard as specified in § 90.100. The rule sets forth procedures for miners to exercise this option, and establishes the right of miners to retain their regular rate of pay and receive wage increases. The rule also sets forth the operator's obligations, including respirable dust sampling for part 90 miners. This part 90 is promulgated pursuant to section 101 of the Act and supersedes section 203(b) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended.</P>

              <P>After the 20th calendar day following receipt of notification from MSHA that a part 90 miner is employed at the mine, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which the part 90 miner in the active workings of the mine is exposed, as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration, at or below:<PRTPAGE P="738"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) 1.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air (mg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>
              <P>(b) 0.5 mg/m<SU>3</SU> as of August 1, 2016.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Respirable dust standard when quartz is present.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable quartz dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which a part 90 miner in the active workings of each mine is exposed at or below 0.1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> (100 micrograms per cubic meter or µg/m<SU>3</SU>) as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration.</P>
              <P>(b) When the mine atmosphere of the active workings where the part 90 miner performs his or her normal work duties exceeds 100 µg/m<SU>3</SU> of respirable quartz dust, the operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which a part 90 miner is exposed as measured with an approved sampling device and expressed in terms of an equivalent concentration at or below the applicable standard. The applicable standard is computed by dividing the percent of quartz into the number 10. The application of this formula shall not result in an applicable standard that exceeds the standards specified in § 90.100.</P>
              <P>Example: Assume the part 90 miner is on a 0.5 mg/m<SU>3</SU> dust standard. Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent concentration of 0.50 mg/m<SU>3</SU> contains 25.6% of quartz dust, which corresponds to a quartz concentration of 128 µg/m<SU>3</SU>. Therefore, the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere associated with that part 90 miner shall be maintained on each shift at or below 0.4 mg/m<SU>3</SU> (10/25.6% = 0.4 mg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 90.102</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Transfer; notice.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Whenever a part 90 miner is transferred in order to meet the applicable standard, the operator shall transfer the miner to an existing position at the same coal mine on the same shift or shift rotation on which the miner was employed immediately before the transfer. The operator may transfer a part 90 miner to a different coal mine, a newly-created position or a position on a different shift or shift rotation if the miner agrees in writing to the transfer. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply when the respirable dust concentration in a part 90 miner's work position complies with the applicable standard but circumstances, such as reductions in workforce or changes in operational status, require a change in the miner's job or shift assignment.</P>
              <P>(b) On or before the 20th calendar day following receipt of notification from MSHA that a part 90 miner is employed at the mine, the operator shall give the District Manager written notice of the occupation and, if applicable, the MMU unit to which the part 90 miner shall be assigned on the 21st calendar day following receipt of the notification from MSHA.</P>
              <P>(c) After the 20th calendar day following receipt of notification from MSHA that a part 90 miner is employed at the mine, the operator shall give the District Manager written notice before any transfer of a part 90 miner. This notice shall include the scheduled date of the transfer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The operator shall compensate each part 90 miner at not less than the regular rate of pay received by that miner immediately before exercising the option under § 90.3.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever a part 90 miner is transferred, the operator shall compensate the miner at not less than the regular rate of pay received by that miner immediately before the transfer.</P>
              <P>(c) Once a miner has been placed in a position in compliance with the provisions of part 90, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply when the part 90 miner initiates and accepts a change in work assignment for reasons of job preference.</P>
              <P>(d) The operator shall compensate each miner who is a section 203(b) miner on January 31, 1981, at not less than the regular rate of pay that the miner is required to receive under section 203(b) of the Act immediately before the effective date of this part.</P>

              <P>(e) In addition to the compensation required to be paid under paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section, the operator shall pay each part 90 miner the actual wage increases that accrue to <PRTPAGE P="739"/>the classification to which the miner is assigned.</P>
              <P>(f) If a miner is temporarily employed in an occupation other than his or her regular work classification for two months or more before exercising the option under § 90.3, the miner's regular rate of pay for purposes of paragraph (a) and (b) of this section is the higher of the temporary or regular rates of pay. If the temporary assignment is for less than two months, the operator may pay the part 90 miner at his or her regular work classification rate regardless of the temporary wage rate.</P>
              <P>(g) If a part 90 miner is transferred, and the Secretary subsequently notifies the miner that notice of the miner's eligibility to exercise the part 90 option was incorrect, the operator shall retain the affected miner in the current position to which the miner is assigned and continue to pay the affected miner the applicable rate of pay provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section, until:</P>
              <P>(1) The affected miner and operator agree in writing to a position with pay at not less than the regular rate of pay for that occupation; or</P>
              <P>(2) A position is available at the same coal mine in both the same occupation and on the same shift on which the miner was employed immediately before exercising the option under § 90.3 or under the old section 203(b) program (36 FR 20601, October 27, 1971).</P>
              <P>(i) When such a position is available, the operator shall offer the available position in writing to the affected miner with pay at not less than the regular rate of pay for that occupation.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the affected miner accepts the available position in writing, the operator shall implement the miner's reassignment upon notice of the miner's acceptance. If the miner does not accept the available position in writing, the miner may be reassigned and protections under part 90 shall not apply. Failure by the miner to act on the written offer of the available position within 15 days after notice of the offer is received from the operator shall operate as an election not to accept the available position.</P>

              <P>(a) A part 90 miner may waive his or her rights and be removed from MSHA's active list of miners who have rights under part 90 by:</P>
              <P>(1) Giving written notification to the Chief, Division of Health, Coal Mine Safety and Health, MSHA, that the miner waives all rights under this part;</P>
              <P>(2) Applying for and accepting a position in an area of a mine which the miner knows has an average respirable dust concentration exceeding the applicable standard; or</P>
              <P>(3) Refusing to accept another position offered by the operator at the same coal mine that meets the requirements of §§ 90.100, 90.101 and 90.102(a) after dust sampling shows that the present position exceeds the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(b) If rights under part 90 are waived, the miner gives up all rights under part 90 until the miner re-exercises the option in accordance with § 90.3(e) (Part 90 option; notice of eligibility; exercise of option).</P>
              <P>(c) If rights under part 90 are waived, the miner may re-exercise the option under this part in accordance with § 90.3(e) (Part 90 option; notice of eligibility; exercise of option) at any time.</P>

              <P>(4) Be kept with the exposed samples after sampling and in the same mailing container when transmitted to MSHA.</P>
              <P>(e) The respirable dust samples required by this part and taken with a CMDPSU shall be collected while the part 90 miner is performing normal work duties.</P>
              <P>(f) Records showing the length of each shift for each part 90 miner shall be made and retained for at least six months, and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and submitted to the District Manager when requested in writing.</P>
              <P>(g) Upon request from the District Manager, the operator shall submit the date and time any respirable dust sampling required by this part will begin. This information shall be submitted at least 48 hours prior to scheduled sampling.</P>
              <P>(h) Operators using CPDMs shall provide training to all part 90 miners. The training shall be completed prior to a part 90 miner wearing a CPDM and then every 12 months thereafter. The training shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The importance of monitoring dust concentrations and properly wearing the CPDM;</P>
              <P>(2) Explaining the basic features and capabilities of the CPDM;</P>
              <P>(3) Discussing the various types of information displayed by the CPDM and how to access that information; and</P>
              <P>(4) How to start and stop a short-term sample run during compliance sampling.</P>
              <P>(i) An operator shall keep a record of the CPDM training at the mine site for 24 months after completion of the training. An operator may keep the record elsewhere if the record is immediately accessible from the mine site by electronic transmission. Upon request from an authorized representative of the Secretary or Secretary of HHS, the operator shall promptly provide access to any such training records. The record shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The date of training;</P>

            <P>This part provides the criteria and procedures for proposing civil penalties under sections 105 and 110 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). The purpose of this part is to provide a fair and equitable procedure for the application of the statutory criteria in determining proposed penalties for violations, to maximize the incentives for mine operators to prevent and correct hazardous conditions, and to assure the prompt and efficient processing and collection of penalties.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The criteria and procedures in this part are applicable to all proposed assessments of civil penalties for violations of the Mine Act and the standards and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Mine Act, as amended. MSHA shall review each citation and order and shall make proposed assessments of civil penalties.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of penalty amount; regular assessment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Except as provided in § 100.5(e), the operator of any mine in which a violation occurs of a mandatory health or safety standard or who violates any other provision of the Mine Act, as amended, shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $72,620. Each occurrence of a violation of a mandatory safety or health standard may constitute a separate offense. The amount of the proposed civil penalty shall be based on the criteria set forth in sections 105(b) and 110(i) of the Mine Act. These criteria are:</P>
            <P>(i) The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the operator charged;</P>
            <P>(ii) The operator's history of previous violations;</P>
            <P>(iii) Whether the operator was negligent;</P>
            <P>(iv) The gravity of the violation;</P>
            <P>(v) The demonstrated good faith of the operator charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of a violation; and</P>
            <P>(vi) The effect of the penalty on the operator's ability to continue in business.</P>
            <P>(2) A regular assessment is determined by first assigning the appropriate number of penalty points to the violation by using the appropriate criteria and tables set forth in this section. The total number of penalty points will then be converted into a dollar amount under the penalty conversion table in paragraph (g) of this section. The penalty amount will be adjusted for demonstrated good faith in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the operator charged.</E> The appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the mine operator's business is calculated by using both the size of the mine cited and the size of the mine's controlling entity. The size of coal mines and their controlling entities is measured by coal production. The size of metal and <PRTPAGE P="748"/>nonmetal mines and their controlling entities is measured by hours worked. The size of independent contractors is measured by the total hours worked at all mines. Penalty points for size are assigned based on Tables I to V. As used in these tables, the terms “annual tonnage” and “annual hours worked” mean coal produced and hours worked in the previous calendar year. In cases where a full year of data is not available, the coal produced or hours worked is prorated to an annual basis. This criterion accounts for a maximum of 25 penalty points.</P>

            </GPH>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">History of previous violations.</E> An operator's history of previous violations is based on both the total number of violations and the number of repeat violations of the same citable provision of a standard in a preceding 15-month period. Only assessed violations that have been paid or finally adjudicated, or have become final orders of the Commission will be included in determining an operator's history. The repeat aspect of the history criterion in paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies only after an operator has received 10 violations or an independent contractor operator has received 6 violations.</P>
            <P>(1) Total number of violations. For mine operators, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the number of violations per inspection day (VPID)(Table VI). Penalty points are not assigned for mines with fewer than 10 violations in the specified history period. For independent contractors, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the total number of violations at all mines (Table VII). This aspect of the history criterion accounts for a maximum of 25 penalty points.</P>

              <GID>ER22MR07.027</GID>
            </GPH>

            <P>(2) Repeat violations of the same standard. Repeat violation history is based on the number of violations of the same citable provision of a standard in a preceding 15-month period. For coal and metal and nonmetal mine operators with a minimum of six repeat violations, penalty points are assigned <PRTPAGE P="753"/>on the basis of the number of repeat violations per inspection day (RPID) (Table VIII). For independent contractors, penalty points are assigned on the basis of the number of violations at all mines (Table IX). This aspect of the history criterion accounts for a maximum of 20 penalty points (Table VIII).</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Negligence.</E> Negligence is conduct, either by commission or omission, which falls below a standard of care established under the Mine Act to protect miners against the risks of harm. Under the Mine Act, an operator is held to a high standard of care. A mine operator is required to be on the alert for conditions and practices in the mine that affect the safety or health of miners and to take steps necessary to correct or prevent hazardous conditions or practices. The failure to exercise a high standard of care constitutes negligence. The negligence criterion assigns penalty points based on the degree to which the operator failed to exercise a high standard of care. When applying this criterion, MSHA considers mitigating circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, actions taken by the operator to prevent or correct hazardous conditions or practices. This criterion accounts for a maximum of 50 penalty points, based on conduct evaluated according to Table X.</P>

            </GPH>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Gravity.</E> Gravity is an evaluation of the seriousness of the violation. This criterion accounts for a maximum of 88 penalty points, as derived from the Tables XI through XIII. Gravity is determined by the likelihood of the occurrence of the event against which a standard is directed; the severity of the <PRTPAGE P="756"/>illness or injury if the event has occurred or was to occur; and the number of persons potentially affected if the event has occurred or were to occur.</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Demonstrated good faith of the operator in abating the violation.</E> This criterion provides a 10% reduction in the penalty amount of a regular assessment where the operator abates the violation within the time set by the inspector.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Penalty conversion table.</E> The penalty conversion table is used to convert the total penalty points to a dollar amount.</P>

            <P>(a) All parties shall be afforded the opportunity to review with MSHA each citation and order issued during an inspection. It is within the sole discretion of MSHA to grant a request for a conference and to determine the nature of the conference.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon notice by MSHA, all parties will have 10 days within which to submit additional information or request a safety and health conference with the District Manager or designee. A conference request may include a request to be notified of, and to participate in, a conference initiated by another party. A conference request must be in writing and must include a brief statement of the reason why each citation or order should be conferenced.</P>

            <P>(d) MSHA will consider all relevant information submitted in a timely manner by the parties with respect to the violation. When the facts warrant a finding that no violation occurred, the citation or order will be vacated. Upon conclusion of the conference, or expiration of the conference request period, all citations that are abated and all orders will be promptly referred to MSHA's Office of Assessments. The Office of Assessments will use the citations, orders, and inspector's evaluation as the basis for determining the appropriate amount of a proposed penalty.</P>

            <P>(b) Upon receipt of the notice of proposed penalty, the party charged shall have 30 days to either:</P>
            <P>(1) Pay the proposed assessment. Acceptance by MSHA of payment tendered by the party charged will close the case.</P>
            <P>(2) Notify MSHA in writing of the intention to contest the proposed penalty. When MSHA receives the notice of contest, it advises the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission) of such notice.

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part establishes the criteria and procedures for determining whether a mine operator has established a pattern of significant and substantial (S&amp;S) violations at a mine. It implements section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) by addressing mines with an inspection history of recurrent S&amp;S violations of mandatory safety or health standards that demonstrate a mine operator's disregard for the health and safety of miners. The purpose of the procedures in this part is the restoration of effective safe and healthful conditions at such mines.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Pattern criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) At least once each year, MSHA will review the compliance and accident, injury, and illness records of mines to determine if any mines meet the pattern of violations criteria. MSHA's review to identify mines with a pattern of S&amp;S violations will include:</P>
            <P>(1) Citations for S&amp;S violations;</P>
            <P>(2) Orders under section 104(b) of the Mine Act for not abating S&amp;S violations;</P>
            <P>(3) Citations and withdrawal orders under section 104(d) of the Mine Act, resulting from the mine operator's unwarrantable failure to comply;</P>
            <P>(4) Imminent danger orders under section 107(a) of the Mine Act;</P>
            <P>(5) Orders under section 104(g) of the Mine Act requiring withdrawal of miners who have not received training and who MSHA declares to be a hazard to themselves and others;</P>
            <P>(6) Enforcement measures, other than section 104(e) of the Mine Act, that have been applied at the mine;</P>
            <P>(7) Other information that demonstrates a serious safety or health management problem at the mine, such as accident, injury, and illness records; and</P>
            <P>(8) Mitigating circumstances.</P>
            <P>(b) MSHA will post the specific pattern criteria on its Web site.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 104.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Issuance of notice.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When a mine has a pattern of violations, the District Manager will issue a pattern of violations notice to the mine operator that specifies the basis for the Agency's action. The District Manager will also provide a copy of this notice to the representative of miners.</P>
            <P>(b) The mine operator shall post the pattern of violations notice issued under this part on the mine bulletin board. The pattern of violations notice shall remain posted at the mine until MSHA terminates it under § 104.4 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) If MSHA finds any S&amp;S violation within 90 days after issuance of the pattern notice, MSHA will issue an order for the withdrawal of all persons from the affected area, except those persons referred to in section 104(c) of the Mine Act, until the violation has been abated.</P>
            <P>(d) If a withdrawal order is issued under paragraph (c) of this section, any subsequent S&amp;S violation will result in a withdrawal order that will remain in effect until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 104.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Termination of notice.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Termination of a section 104(e)(1) pattern of violations notice shall occur when an MSHA inspection of the entire mine finds no S&amp;S violations or if MSHA does not issue a withdrawal order in accordance with section 104(e)(1) of the Mine Act within 90 days after the issuance of the pattern of violations notice.<PRTPAGE P="762"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) The mine operator may request an inspection of the entire mine or portion of the mine. MSHA will not provide advance notice of the inspection and will determine the scope of the inspection. Inspections of portions of the mine, within 90 days, that together cover the entire mine shall constitute an inspection of the entire mine for the purposes of this part.</P>
