      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regulatory process overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Most rules of local applicability are issued by District Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers while rules of wider applicability are issued by senior Coast Guard officials at Coast Guard Headquarters. For both significant rulemaking (defined by Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review) and non-significant rulemaking, other than those areas delegated to District Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers the regulatory process begins when an office chief with program responsibilities identifies a possible need for a new regulation or for changes to an existing regulation. The need may arise due to statutory changes, or be based on internal review or public input. Early public involvement is strongly encouraged.</P>

              <P>(b) After a tentative significant regulatory approach is developed, a significant regulatory project proposal is submitted to the Marine Safety and Security Council for approval. The proposal describes the scope of the proposed regulation, alternatives considered, and potential cost and benefits, including possible environmental impacts. All significant regulatory projects require <PRTPAGE P="14"/>Marine Safety and Security Council approval.</P>
              <P>(c) Significant rulemaking documents must also be approved by the Commandant of the Coast Guard.</P>

              <P>(d) If the project is approved, the necessary documents are drafted, including documents to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> These may include regulatory evaluations, environmental analyses, requests for comments, announcements of public meetings, notices of proposed rulemakings, and final rules.</P>

              <P>The Coast Guard considers public participation essential to effective rulemaking, and encourages the public to participate in its rulemaking process. Coast Guard policy is to provide opportunities for public participation early in potential rulemaking projects. Generally, the Coast Guard will solicit public input by publishing a notice of public meeting or request for comments in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Supplemental Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, and Interim Rules will usually provide 90 days, or more if possible, after publication for submission of comments. This time period is intended to allow interested persons the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through the submission of written data and views. However, certain cases and circumstances may make it necessary to provide a shorter comment period. Public meetings may also be held to provide an opportunity for oral presentations. The Coast Guard will consider the comments received and, in subsequent rulemaking documents, will incorporate a concise general statement of the comments received and identify changes from a proposed rule based on the comments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Petitions for rulemaking.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any member of the public may petition the Coast Guard to undertake a rulemaking action. There is no prescribed form for a petition for rulemaking, but the document should provide some supporting information as to why the petitioner believes the proposed rulemaking is necessary and the document should clearly indicate that it is a petition for rulemaking. Petitions should be addressed to the Commandant (CG-0943), Attn: Executive Secretary, Marine Safety and Security Council, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7213, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7213.</P>

              <P>(b) The petitioner will be notified of the Coast Guard's decision whether to initiate a rulemaking or not. If the Coast Guard decides not to pursue a rulemaking, the petitioner will be notified of the reasons why. If the Coast Guard decides to initiate rulemaking, it will follow the procedure outlined in this subpart. The Coast Guard may publish a notice acknowledging receipt of a petition for rulemaking in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <P>(a) A public docket is maintained electronically for each petition for rulemaking and each Coast Guard rulemaking project and notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Each docket contains copies of every rulemaking document published for the project, public comments received, summaries of public meetings or hearings, regulatory assessments, and other publicly-available information. Members of the public may inspect the public docket and copy any documents in the docket. Public dockets for Coast Guard rulemakings are available electronically at <E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E> To access a rulemaking, enter the docket number associated with rulemaking in the “Search” box and click “Go &gt;&gt;.” These documents are also kept at a <PRTPAGE P="15"/>Docket Management Facility maintained by the Department of Transportation, West Building, room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590.</P>

              <P>An advance notice of proposed rulemaking may be used to alert the affected public about a new regulatory project, or when the Coast Guard needs more information about what form proposed regulations should take, the actual need for a regulation, the cost of a proposal, or any other information.

              <P>Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, an NPRM is generally published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for Coast Guard rulemakings. The NPRM normally contains a preamble statement in sufficient detail to explain the proposal, its background, basis, and purpose, and the various issues involved. It also contains a discussion of any comments received in response to prior notices, a citation of legal authority for the rule, and the text of the proposed rule.</P>

The supplemental notice advises the public of the revised proposal and provides an opportunity for additional comment.

              <P>(a) An interim rule may be issued when it is in the public interest to promulgate an effective rule while keeping the rulemaking open for further refinement. For example, an interim rule may be issued in instances when normal procedures for notice and comment prior to issuing an effective rule are not required, minor changes to the final rule may be necessary after the interim rule has been in place for some time, or the interim rule only implements portions of a proposed rule, while other portions of the proposed rule are still under development.</P>
              <P>(b) An interim rule will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> with an effective date that will generally be at least 30 days after the date of publication. After the effective date, an interim rule is enforceable and is codified in the next annual revision of the appropriate title of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

              <P>In some instances, a final rule may be issued without prior notice and comment. When notice and comment procedures have been used, and after all comments received have been considered, a final rule is issued. A final rule document contains a preamble that discusses comments received, responses to comments and changes made from the proposed or interim rule, a citation of legal authority, and the text of the rule.</P>

              <P>(c) The public will usually be given at least 60 days from the date of publication in which to submit comments or notice of intent to submit comments.</P>

              <P>(d) If no adverse comment or notice of intent to submit an adverse comment is received within the specified period, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to confirm that the rule will go into effect as scheduled.</P>

              <P>(e) If the Coast Guard receives a written adverse comment or a written notice of intent to submit an adverse comment, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the final rule section of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to announce withdrawal of the direct final rule. If an adverse comment clearly applies to only part of a rule, and it is possible to remove that part without affecting the remaining portions, the Coast Guard may adopt as final those parts of the rule on which no adverse comment was received. Any part of a rule that is the subject of an adverse comment will be withdrawn. If the Coast Guard decides to proceed with a rulemaking following receipt of an adverse comment, a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be published unless an exception to the Administrative Procedure Act requirements for notice and comment applies.</P>
              <P>(f) A comment is considered adverse if the comment explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change.</P>

              <P>(a) Any person may report an apparent violation of any law, regulation, or order that is enforced by the Coast Guard to any Coast Guard facility. When a report of an apparent violation has been received, or when an apparent violation has been detected by any Coast Guard personnel, the matter is investigated or evaluated by Coast Guard personnel. Once an apparent violation has been investigated or evaluated, a report of the investigation may be sent to the District Commander or other designated official in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or a Notice of Violation under § 1.07-11 may be given to the party by an issuing officer.</P>

              <P>(b) Reports of any investigation conducted by the Coast Guard or received from any other agency which indicate that a violation may have occurred may be forwarded to a District Commander or other designated official for further action. This is normally the District Commander of the District in which the violation is believed to have occurred, or the District in which the reporting unit or agency is found. The report is reviewed to determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish a <E T="03">prima facie</E> case. If there is insufficient evidence, the case is either returned for further investigation or closed if further action is unwarranted. The case is closed in situations in which the investigation has established that a violation did not occur, the violator is unknown, or there is little likelihood of discovering additional relevant facts. If it is determined that a <E T="03">prima facie</E> case does exist, a case file is prepared and forwarded to the Hearing Officer, with a recommended action. A record of any prior violations by the same person or entity, is forwarded with the case file.</P>

If, on the basis of the preliminary examination, the Hearing Officer determines that there is insufficient evidence to proceed, or that there is any other reason which would make penalty action inappropriate, the Hearing Officer returns the case to the District Commander with a written statement of the reason. The District Commander may close the case or cause a further investigation of the alleged violation to be made with a view toward resubmittal of the case to the Hearing Officer.</P>
              <P>(b) If on the basis of the preliminary examination of the case file, the Hearing Officer determines that a violation appears to have been committed, the Hearing Officer notifies the party in writing of:</P>
              <P>(1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations;</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation;</P>
              <P>(3) The general nature of the procedure for assessing and collecting the penalty;</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of penalty that appears to be appropriate, based on the material then available to the Hearing Officer;</P>
              <P>(5) The right to examine all materials in the case file and have a copy of all written documents provided upon request; and,</P>
              <P>(6) The fact that the party may demand a hearing prior to any actual assessment of a penalty.</P>
              <P>(c) If at any time it appears that the addition of another party to the proceedings is necessary or desirable, the Hearing Officer provides the additional party with notice as described above.</P>

              <P>(a) Within 30 days after receipt of notice of the initiation of the action, as described above, the party, or counsel for the party, may request a hearing, provide any written evidence and arguments in lieu of a hearing, or pay the amount specified in the notice as being appropriate. A hearing must be requested in writing; the request must specify the issues which are in dispute. Failure to specify a nonjurisdictional issue will preclude its consideration.</P>
              <P>(b) The right to a hearing is waived if the party does not submit the request to the Hearing Officer within 30 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation. At the discretion of the Hearing Officer, a hearing may be granted if the party submits a late request.</P>
              <P>(c) The Hearing Officer must promptly schedule all hearings which are requested. The Hearing Officer shall grant any delays or continuances which may be necessary or desirable in the interest of fairly resolving the case.</P>
              <P>(d) A party who has requested a hearing may amend the specification of the issues in dispute at any time up to 10 days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Issues raised later than 10 days before the scheduled hearing may be presented only at the discretion of the Hearing Officer.</P>

              <P>A party may present the testimony of any witness either through a personal appearance or through a written statement. The party may request the assistance of the Hearing Officer in obtaining the personal appearance of a witness. The request must be in writing and state the reasons why a written statement would be inadequate, the issue or issues to which the testimony would be relevant, and the substance of the expected testimony. If the Hearing Officer determines that the personal appearance of the witness may materially aid in the decision on the case, the Hearing Officer seeks to obtain the witness' appearance. Because many statutes prescribing civil penalties do not provide subpoena power, there may be cases where a witness cannot be required to attend. In such a case, the Hearing Officer may move the hearing to the witness' location, accept a written statement, or accept a stipulation in lieu of testimony.

              <P>(a) The Hearing Officer must conduct a fair and impartial proceeding in which the party is given a full opportunity to be heard. At the outset of the <PRTPAGE P="20"/>hearing, the Hearing Officer insures that the party is aware of the nature of the proceeding and of the alleged violation, and of the provisions of the law or regulation allegedly violated.</P>
              <P>(b) The material in the case file pertinent to the issues to be determined by the Hearing Officer is presented. The party has the right to examine, and to respond to or rebut, this material. The party may offer any facts, statements, explanations, documents, sworn or unsworn testimony, or other exculpatory items which bear on appropriate issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an appropriate penalty. The Hearing Officer may require the authentication of any written exhibit or statement.</P>
              <P>(c) At the close of the party's presentation of evidence, the Hearing Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The Hearing Officer may allow the party to respond to any such evidence submitted.</P>
              <P>(d) In receiving evidence, the Hearing Officer is not bound by strict rules of evidence. In evaluating the evidence presented, the Hearing Officer must give due consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of evidence.</P>
              <P>(e) The Hearing Officer may take notice of matters which are subject to a high degree of indisputability and are commonly known in the community or are ascertainable from readily available sources of known accuracy. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Hearing Officer gives the party an opportunity to show why notice should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the Hearing Officer places a written statement of the matters as to which notice was taken in the record, with the basis for such notice, including a statement that the party consented to notice being taken or a summary of the party's objections.</P>
              <P>(f) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the party may present argument on the issues in the case. The party may also request an opportunity to submit a written statement for consideration by the Hearing Officer and for further review. The Hearing Officer shall allow a reasonable time for submission of the statement and shall specify the date by which it must be received. If the statement is not received within the time prescribed, or within the limits of any extension of time granted by the Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer renders his decision in the case.</P>

If the Hearing Officer finds that there is not substantial evidence in the record establishing the alleged violation or some other violation of which the party had full and fair notice, the Hearing Officer shall dismiss the case and remand it to the District Commander.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 641(b), authorizes the Coast Guard to sell apparatus or equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard, which is not readily procurable in the open market. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 654 (Pub. L. 86-159 approved Aug. 14, 1959), authorize the Coast Guard to sell supplies and furnish services to public and commercial vessels, and other watercraft. 49 U.S.C. 44502(d) authorizes the Coast Guard to provide for assistance, the sale of fuel, oil, equipment, and supplies, to an aircraft when necessary to allow the aircraft to continue to the nearest private airport.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Charges established by District Commander.</E> The charges for supplies and services which may be normally expected to be furnished to persons, corporations, companies, vessels, and other watercraft, and non-Federal aircraft will vary between various geographical regions depending on local circumstances. The District Commander is hereby delegated authority to prescribe and he shall establish, in advance wherever practicable, the charges to be imposed and collected in various areas under his jurisdiction, which will be in accordance with the applicable general minimum terms and conditions in the laws and this section. In those cases where the charges have not been established in advance, the matter shall be priced on an individual basis, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances regarding the situation. The list(s) of charges established by the District Commander shall be available for reading and copying at the office of the issuing District Commander, which list(s) will be up-dated and reissued when necessary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sales to vessels and other watercraft.</E> (1) The charges imposed for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(2) Charges for sales of supplies and/or furnishing of services are considered appropriate when the furnishing of food, fuel, general stores, or repairs to the vessel or its equipage are primarily for the convenience of the owner, master, or crew, and furnished at his or their request. It is not intended and the Coast Guard does not procure and stock equipment and supplies except as provided for in current instructions issued by competent authority.</P>
              <P>(3) Supplies provided and services performed will be of a limited nature consistent with the situation and within the capabilities of the Coast Guard unit concerned; provided this will not be in competition with commercial enterprise when such facilities are available and deemed adequate. It is not intended to permit the operators of vessels or watercraft to take advantage of the Government by demanding free supplies or services. Determination as to whether charges will be made is dependent upon the circumstances involved in each instance. The responsibility to make this determination rests with the District Commander who may delegate it to his subordinates.</P>
              <P>(4) The minimum charge for any supplies or services furnished to a vessel or other watercraft shall be $10. The prices for fuels and materials which may be sold will be at Coast Guard cost plus 20 percent or, if readily determinable, at the commercial price in the immediate operating area, whichever is higher. The charges for services furnished a vessel or watercraft will be an average cost equal to the full price, plus taxes, that a boat owner would pay a local commercial concern for such services.</P>

              <P>(5) The sales of supplies and services will be documented and will set forth <PRTPAGE P="28"/>the name, type, and identifying number of the vessel or watercraft receiving supplies or services; name and address of vessel's owner; and conditions under which it was determined to make a sale to the vessel or watercraft. Wherever possible, payment shall be obtained at the time supplies and services are furnished.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Sales of equipment not readily procurable on the open market.</E> Charges imposed for sales of apparatus and equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard which, in the opinion of the Commandant (CG-9), is not readily procurable in the open market, are subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The apparatus or equipment has not been reported as excess to the General Services Administration (if so reported, requests to purchase will be submitted by the Commandant (CG-9) to the General Services Administration); and,</P>
              <P>(2) The apparatus or equipment is not classified for security reasons or is not dangerous to the public health and safety; and,</P>
              <P>(3) The authorized buyers of this apparatus or equipment are foreign, State, or municipal governments or governmental units thereof; parties required to maintain private aids to navigation; contractors engaged on public works; and in other cases in which, in the judgment of the Commandant (FS), the public interest may be served; and,</P>
              <P>(4) The approved sales will be at prices determined by the Commandant (CG-9), which will include an overhead charge not to exceed 25 percent of acquisition cost.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Sales to and storage of non-Federal aircraft.</E> (1) Activities having the necessary supplies and facilities are authorized to furnish fuel, oil, equipment, supplies, mechanical services, temporary storage, or other assistance to any aircraft operated by State, municipal, or private enterprise in emergency cases. Complete engines, airplane wings, or other major items of equipment shall not be furnished without prior authority from the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(2) Aircraft damaged to the extent that major repairs are required may be given emergency storage at the request of the pilot, provided the necessary facilities are available. No such aircraft will be given a major or minor overhaul. Damaged aircraft may be stored in its original damaged condition. If aircraft requires extensive repairs, such as would include the replacing of major parts and such major parts cannot be made available or supplied within a reasonable length of time by the operator of such aircraft, then the aircraft must be removed from the Coast Guard reservation by the operator without delay.</P>
              <P>(3) The Government will not assume any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by such aircraft while on a Coast Guard reservation and the owner shall be required to remove the aircraft from the reservation at the earliest practicable date.</P>
              <P>(4) Storage charges for such aircraft on a Coast Guard reservation shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For the first 6 working days, no charge;</P>
              <P>(ii) For each calendar day thereafter, $3 for a single motor plane and $5 for a dual or multiengine plane.</P>
              <P>(5) In the absence of any information to the contrary regarding a particular item or material, the price at which the item is carried in stock, or on the Plant Property Record (book price) will be regarded as the fair market value.</P>
              <P>(6) When materials or services or both materials and services are furnished an aircraft, a deposit equal to the estimated value of such services and materials as will be required shall be obtained in advance of the rendition of the services and issuance of the materials.</P>

              <P>(7) The charges for mechanical services rendered (other than in connection with the arrival, refueling, and departure of airplanes) shall be an hourly charge for labor, with a minimum of 1 hour, which shall be the equivalent to the schedule of wage rates for civilian <PRTPAGE P="29"/>personnel for the district (i.e., machinists, helpers, etc.), regardless of whether the services are performed by enlisted or civilian personnel.</P>

                <P>For example, the definition of “inland waters” in the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2003(o)) would control the interpretation of inland <PRTPAGE P="31"/>navigation rules created under that Act and the “inland waters” definition in 46 CFR 10.103 would control regulations in 46 CFR part 10. Also, in various laws administered and enforced by the Coast Guard, the terms “State” and “United States” are defined to include some or all of the territories and possessions of the United States. The definitions in §§ 2.36 and 2.38 should be considered as supplementary to these statutory definitions and not as interpretive of them.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General description.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Coast Guard's general organization for the performance of its assigned functions and duties consists of the Commandant, assisted by the Headquarters staff, two Area Offices to act as intermediate echelons of operational command, and District and Sector Offices to provide regional direction and coordination. Area, District, and Sector offices operate within defined geographical areas of the United States, its territories, and possessions, including portions of the high seas adjacent thereto. They are established by the Commandant and their areas of responsibility are described in this part.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The two Coast Guard Areas are the Atlantic Area and the Pacific Area. A Coast Guard Area Commander is in command of a Coast Guard Area. The Atlantic Area Office is collocated with the Fifth Coast Guard District Office. The Pacific Area Office is collocated with the Eleventh Coast Guard District Office. Area Commanders are responsible for determining when operational matters require the coordination of forces and facilities of more than one district.</P>
              <P>(2) For search and rescue (SAR) mission execution in the Atlantic Area, Districts may execute SAR missions to the full extent of the Area's Search and Rescue Region (SRR). Under this plan, Districts in the Atlantic Area will assume SAR Coordinator responsibilities and will act as SAR Mission Coordinator for any case prosecuted within their expanded regions. The exact coordinates of Atlantic Area's SRR can be found in the United States National Search and Rescue Supplement to the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual.</P>
              <P>(c) A Coast Guard District Commander is in command of a Coast Guard District and the District Commander's office may be referred to as a Coast Guard District Office. The District Commander's duties are described in § 1.01-1 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) A Coast Guard Sector Commander is in command of a Coast Guard Sector and the Sector Commander's office is referred to as a Coast Guard Sector Office. The Sector Commander is responsible for all Coast Guard missions within the sector's area of responsibility. Unless otherwise specified, the Sector Commander's authorities include Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator, Federal Maritime Security Coordinator, Federal On-Scene Coordinator, and, in most Sectors, Officer in Charge Marine Inspection (OCMI) and Captain of the Port (COTP). In his or her capacities as OCMI and COTP, the Sector Commander is responsible for a Marine Inspection Zone and COTP Zone.</P>
              <P>(2) In some Sectors, a Marine Safety Unit (MSU) retains OCMI and COTP authority over a designated portion of the Sector's area of responsibility. In such cases, OCMI and COTP authority is exercised by the MSU Commander, not the Sector Commander. The appeal of a COTP order or OCMI matter is routed from the MSU Commander through the Sector Commander and then to the District Commander.</P>
              <P>(3) Some specified sectors exercise Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator (SMC) authority over a designated portion of an encompassing sector's area of responsibility. In such cases, SMC authority is exercised by the encompassed sector, not the encompassing sector. The encompassing sector retains all other authorities (as listed in 33 CFR 3.01-1(d)(1)) over the designated area.</P>
              <P>(e) An OCMI is in command of a Marine Inspection Zone and his or her office may be referred to as a Coast Guard Marine Inspection Office. The OCMI's duties are described in § 1.01-20 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(f) A COTP is in command of a COTP Zone and his or her office may be referred to as a COTP Office. The COTP's duties are described in § 1.01-30 of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(g) Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this part also includes the United States territorial seas adjacent to the described area or zone for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a statute effective in the United States territorial seas. Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this part also includes the contiguous zone adjacent to the area or zone for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a <PRTPAGE P="36"/>statute effective in the contiguous zone, as defined in § 2.28 of this subchapter. Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this part also includes the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) adjacent to the area for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a statute effective in the EEZ, as defined in § 2.30 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(h) Geographic descriptions used in this part are based upon boundaries and points located using the WGS 1984 world grid system. When referenced, the outermost extent of the U.S. EEZ is the line of demarcation produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using the NAD 1983 coordinate system and projected to the WGS 1984 grid system. Both coordinate systems are geocentric and similar such that they are Global Positioning System (GPS) compatible throughout the area of concern. Resolution is based upon ddmmss readings to tenths of a second. This corresponds to a positional precision of about ±2 meters. Decimal degrees to 5 decimal places correspond to a positional precision of about ±1 meter. State boundaries used to determine points for descriptions of jurisdictional limits were based upon the National Transportation Atlas Database 2003 produced by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This data set was produced at a scale of 1:100,000 and theoretically results in a nationwide locational accuracy of about ±50 meters of true position.</P>

              <P>Lifesaving Medals may be awarded to any person who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck or other peril of the water. In order for a person to be eligible for a Lifesaving Medal the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States. If such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold. If such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of gold but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Lifesaving Medals may be awarded posthumously.</P>

Gold and silver bars may be awarded posthumously.</P>

Applications and recommendations for the award of a Lifesaving Medal may be filed by or in behalf of the person making or attempting a rescue under circumstances contemplated by the regulations in this subpart. Applications or recommendations for award of medals or requests for information pertaining thereto should be addressed to the Commander of the Coast Guard District, hereinafter called the District Commander, where the incident took place. (See part 3 of this subchapter for descriptions of Coast Guard Districts.) If the District is unknown, or if the incident took place outside any such district, applications and recommendations should be addressed to the Commander, Personnel Service Center (PSC-PSD-M&amp;A), U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7200, 4200 Wilson Boulevard Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 20598-7200.</P>
              <P>(b) Completed applications must include:</P>
              <P>(1) Satisfactory evidence of the services performed, in the form of affidavits, made by eyewitnesses of good repute and standing testifying of their own knowledge. The opinion of witnesses that the person for whom an award is sought imperiled his or her own life or made signal exertions is not sufficient but the affidavits must set forth in detail all facts and occurrences tending to show clearly in what manner and to what extent life was risked or signal exertions made so that the Commandant may judge for himself as to the degree of merit involved.</P>
              <P>(2) The precise locality of the rescue or attempted rescue, whether from waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue is outside such waters, whether one or the other of the parties is a citizen of the United States, or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States, shall be stated. The date, time of day, nature of the weather, condition of the water, the names of all persons present when practicable, the names of all persons rendering assistance, and all pertinent circumstances and data, showing the precise nature and degree of risk involved, should be stated.</P>
              <P>(c) Recommendations must include:</P>

              <P>(1) As much of the information indicated in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section which is available to the person making the recommendation. Upon receipt the Commandant or the cognizant District Commander shall cause such recommendation to be referred to an investigating officer who <PRTPAGE P="69"/>shall cause to be developed such additional information and evidence as is deemed necessary to either (i) terminate the investigation as containing insufficient justification to continue further, or (ii) to complete the application for submission to the Commandant for his final determination.</P>
              <P>(d) Either the Commandant or the District Commander may, without any application or recommendation, of his own motion, order an informal investigation into such an incident under Administrative Investigations Manual, COMDTINST M5830.1A (2007).</P>
              <P>(e) Affidavits required by this subpart shall be made before an officer duly authorized to administer oaths and if taken before an officer without an official seal, his official character must be certified by the proper officer of a court of record, under the seal thereof, unless the oath be taken before an officer of the Armed Forces authorized to administer oaths under the provisions of Article 136, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. 936).</P>
              <P>(f) Cognizant District Commanders shall act upon all applications and recommendations submitted to them from whatever source and shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Forward completed applications with his recommendations to the Commandant for his consideration and determination; or,</P>
              <P>(2) Inform the applicant or the person submitting the recommendation that he considers such application or recommendation incomplete together with the reasons therefor and that a period of 90 days will be allowed for additional evidence to be provided upon the expiration of which he will file the application or recommendation without further action.</P>
              <P>(g) Whenever the cognizant District Commander shall deem such action necessary, he may require that the aforementioned affidavits shall be accompanied by a certificate showing the affiants to be credible persons, certified by some U.S. Officer, such as a judge or clerk of a U.S. Court, district attorney, collector of customs, postmaster, or officer of the Armed Forces. If the affiant is a citizen or resident of a foreign country and if the affidavit is executed in such foreign country, the credibility certificate may be executed by an officer of such foreign country, who occupies an official position similar to the aforementioned U.S. officers.</P>
              <P>(h) The decision of the Commandant on all applications, recommendations, and investigations for the Gold or Silver Lifesaving Medals shall be final.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for effecting individual waivers of navigation and vessel inspection laws and regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is hereby found necessary in the interest of national defense to waive compliance with the navigation and vessel inspection laws administered by the Coast Guard, as well as the regulations issued thereunder and contained in 46 CFR Chapter I or in this chapter, to the extent and in the manner and upon the terms and conditions as set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) An application requesting that a waiver be made effective with respect to a particular vessel may be made by any authorized representative of an agency of the United States Government or any other interested person (including the master, agent, or owner of the vessel involved). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a vessel in any port or place of the Canal Zone or in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such facilities have been established. Every application shall contain a statement of the particular provisions of law with respect to which waiver of compliance is requested, a certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense and, an outline of the facts upon which such certification is based. The Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly examine every application for the purpose of determining whether the necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the waiver be made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In any case in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred. In all other cases such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the extent and under the circumstances specified by him.</P>

            <P>(c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="73"/>paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the remaining copy kept on file.</P>
            <P>(d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the order.</P>
            <P>(e) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law (or regulation, if any), the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.</P>

The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located.

            <P>(c) The Coast Guard officer making the waiver in paragraph (a) of this section effective for a particular vessel shall immediately prepare, in quadruplicate, an order setting forth:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and official number of the vessel involved;</P>
            <P>(2) The laws and/or regulations with respect to which the waiver is effective;</P>
            <P>(3) The extent to which compliance with such laws and/or regulations is waived; and</P>
            <P>(4) The period for which the waiver shall be effective.</P>
            <P>(d) If practicable, one copy of this waiver order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the waiver order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the waiver order shall be delivered to the Commander, Military Sealift Command, or his duly designated representative, who submitted the application. One copy of the waiver order shall be transmitted to the Commandant (CG-CVC) and the remaining copy kept on file.</P>
            <P>(e) In any case of extreme urgency, the application for a waiver order may be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative, or the designated representative of the Commandant, or the Commandant, as the case may be), determines that the conditions in this section have been met, the waiver order shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the confirming written waiver order.</P>
            <P>(f) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law and/or regulation, the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements of this section.</P>

This waiver shall not relieve a commercial vessel loading or unloading explosives at the Department of Defense waterfront installations from the requirement of securing a permit from the Coast Guard for such operations with respect to quantitative or other restrictions imposed by the Coast Guard on the basis of each vessel's ability to meet prescribed stowage and handling requirements.</P>

              <P>(a) A presiding ALJ may for good cause, with the approval of the Chief <PRTPAGE P="83"/>ALJ and with all parties given notice and opportunity to object, consolidate any matters at issue in two or more administrative proceedings docketed under this part. (Good cause includes the proceedings' possessing common parties, questions of fact, and issues of law and presenting the likelihood that consolidation would expedite the proceedings and serve the interests of justice.) The ALJ may not consolidate any matters if consolidation would prejudice any rights available under this part or impair the right of any party to place any matters at issue.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless directed otherwise by the Chief ALJ, a presiding ALJ may, either in response to a motion or on his or her own motion, for good cause, sever any administrative proceeding with respect to some or all parties, claims, and issues.</P>

The video recording may be in conjunction with an oral examination by telephone conference held pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section. After the deposition has been taken, and copies of the video recording are provided to parties requesting them, the person recording the deposition shall immediately place the videotape in a sealed envelope or a sealed videotape container, attaching to it a statement identifying the proceeding and the deponent and certifying as to the authenticity of the video recording, and return the videotape by accountable means to the ALJ. The deposition becomes a part of the record of the proceedings in the same manner as a transcribed deposition. The videotape, if admitted into evidence, will be played during the hearing and transcribed into the record by the reporter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Summary decisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any party may move for a summary decision in all or any part of the proceeding on the grounds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party must file the motion no later than 15 days before the date fixed for the hearing and may include supporting affidavits with the motion. Any other party, 10 days or less after service of a motion for summary decision, may serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision. The ALJ may set the matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs.</P>

              <P>(b) The ALJ may grant the motion if the filed affidavits, the filed documents, the material obtained by discovery or otherwise, or matters officially noted show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that a <PRTPAGE P="91"/>party is entitled to a summary decision as a matter of law.</P>
              <P>(c) Each affidavit must set forth such matters as would be admissible in evidence and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit. Once a party has moved for summary decision and supported his or her motion as provided in this section, no party opposing the motion may rest upon the mere allegations or denials of facts contained in his or her own pleadings. The response to the motion, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this section, must provide a specific basis to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact for the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) If it appears from the affidavit of a party opposing the motion that this party cannot, for reasons stated, present by affidavit matters essential to justify his or her opposition, the ALJ may deny the motion for summary decision, may order a continuance to enable the obtaining of information, or may make such other order as is just.</P>

              <P>(1) A finding on each material issue of fact and conclusion of law, and the basis for each finding;</P>
              <P>(2) The disposition of the case, including any appropriate order;</P>

In rendering his or her decision from the bench, the ALJ shall state the issues in the case and make clear, on the record, his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law.</P>
              <P>(d) If the ALJ renders the initial decision orally, and if a party asks for a copy, the Hearing Docket Clerk shall furnish a copy excerpted from the transcript of the record. The date of the decision is the date of the oral rendering of the decision by the ALJ.</P>

              <P>(c) The ALJ may reopen the record of a proceeding if he or she believes that any change in fact or law, or that the public interest, warrants reopening it.</P>

              <P>(d) The filing of a motion to reopen the record of a proceeding does not affect any period for appeals specified in subpart J of this part, except that the filing of such a motion tolls the running of whatever time remains in the <PRTPAGE P="92"/>period for appeals until either the ALJ acts on the motion or the party filing it withdraws it.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) At any time, a party may file a petition to reopen with the Docketing Center for the ALJ to rescind any order suspending or revoking a merchant mariner's license, certificate of registry, credential, or endorsement document if—</P>
              <P>(i) The order rests on a conviction—</P>
              <P>(A) For violation of a dangerous-drug law;</P>
              <P>(B) Of an offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of the license, certificate, credential, or endorsement document; or</P>
              <P>(C) Of an offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C. 401, note); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The respondent submits a specific order of court to the effect that the conviction has been unconditionally set aside for all purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) The ALJ, however, may not rescind his or her order on account of any law that provides for a subsequent conditional setting-aside, modification, or expunging of the order of court, by way of granting clemency or other relief after the conviction has become final, without regard to whether punishment was imposed.</P>
              <P>(f) Three years or less after an S&amp;R proceeding has resulted in revocation of a credential, endorsement, license, certificate, or document, the respondent may file a motion for reopening of the proceeding to modify the order of revocation with the ALJ Docketing Center.</P>
              <P>(1) Any motion to reopen the record must clearly state why the basis for the order of revocation is no longer valid and how the issuance of a new merchant mariner credential with appropriate endorsement is compatible with the requirement of good discipline and safety at sea.</P>
              <P>(2) Any party who does not respond to any petition to reopen the record waives any objection to the motion.</P>

But the judgment is admissible in evidence and constitutes substantial evidence adverse to the respondent.</P>
              <P>(c) A judgment of conviction by a Federal or State court for a violation is conclusive in the proceeding if an S&amp;R proceeding alleges conviction for—</P>

              <P>(d) If the respondent participates in the scheme of a State for the expungement of convictions, and if he or she pleads <E T="03">guilty</E> or <E T="03">no contest</E> or, by order of the trial court, has to attend classes, contribute time or money, receive treatment, submit to any manner of probation or supervision, or forgo appeal of the finding of the trial court, the Coast Guard regards him or her, for the purposes of 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704, as having received a conviction. The Coast Guard does not consider the conviction expunged without proof that the expungement is due to the conviction's having been in error.</P>

              <P>(a) General rules:</P>
              <P>(1) A claim for property loss or damage may be presented by anyone having an interest in the property, including an insurer or other subrogee, unless the interest is barred under § 25.109(a).</P>
              <P>(2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the person injured.</P>
              <P>(3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administrator of the decedent's estate, or any other person legally entitled to assert such a claim under local law. The claimant's status must be stated in the claim.</P>
              <P>(4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be presented by any person who by reason of family relationship has, in fact, incurred the expenses.</P>
              <P>(b) A joint claim must be presented in the names of and signed by, the joint claimants, and the settlement must be made payable to the joint claimants.</P>
              <P>(c) A claim may be presented by a duly authorized agent, legal representative or survivor, if it is presented in the name of the claimant. If the claim is not signed by the claimant, the agent, legal representative, or survivor shall indicate their title or legal capacity and provide evidence of their authority to present the claim.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 25.109</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Insurance and other subrogated claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The claims of an insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute a single claim. The total award of combined claims may not exceed the monetary jurisdiction of the settlement authority. If the total award of the combined claims exceeds, or is expected to exceed, a settlement authority's limits, the settlement authority is not permitted to consider either, and the claim file will be forwarded to an appropriate settlement authority.</P>
              <P>(b) An insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) may file a claim jointly or separately. If the insurer has fully reimbursed the insured, payment will only be made to the insurer. If separate claims are filed, the settlement will be made payable to each claimant to the extent of that claimant's undisputed interest. If joint claims are filed, the settlement will be sent to the insurer.</P>
              <P>(c) Each claimant shall include with a claim, a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage including:</P>
              <P>(1) The names and addresses of all insurers;</P>
              <P>(2) The kind and amount of insurance;</P>
              <P>(3) The policy number;</P>

              <P>(4) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and, if so, the amount of that claim; and whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or in part, or has indicated payment will be made.<PRTPAGE P="101"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) Each subrogee shall substantiate an interest or right to file a claim by appropriate documentary evidence and shall support the claim as to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of any other claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does not constitute evidence of liability of the United States or conclusive evidence of the amount of damages. The settlement authority makes an independent determination on the issues of fact and law based upon the evidence of record.</P>
              <P>(e) An insurance or other subrogated claim is not payable under Subpart E, F, or G of this part.</P>

              <P>(4) Except upon a showing of good cause for delay in accepting a proposed settlement within 45 days, treats the non-acceptance as a rejection. Rejection by a claimant of an offer of settlement renders the offer void.</P>

              <P>(5) If a claimant rejects a proposed settlement or fails to reply within 45 days, the settlement authority may make further efforts to settle the claim. When the settlement authority determines that further efforts to settle the claim are not warranted, the settlement authority notifies the claimant in writing by registered or <PRTPAGE P="104"/>certified mail, return receipt requested, that the claim has been denied because the amount claimed is excessive.</P>

              <P>(c) Following any investigation or other action deemed necessary for reconsideration of the original action, the settlement authority reconsiders the claim and if warranted attempts to settle it.

            <P>The Coast Guard conducts a program for appointing qualified men and women as cadets who are admitted to the Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut. The Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy tenders appointments on the basis of previous academic performance, reported College Entrance Examination Board or American College Testing scores, and the findings of a Cadet Candidate Evaluation Board, consisting of Coast Guard officers appointed by the Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy, which reviews each applicant's personal qualifications. In addition, a Service Academy Medical Examination must be satisfactorily completed before appointment. Applications must be submitted online at <E T="03">http://www.uscga.edu</E> using Coast Guard forms CGA-14, CGA-14A, CGA-14B, CGA-14C, and CGA-14D. These forms, along with additional information on the Cadet appointment program, may be obtained from the Director of Admissions, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, New London, CT 06320.</P>

            <P>(a) The Coast Guard is a military service which operates within the Department of Homeland Security. All personnel enlisted in the Coast Guard are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person desiring to enlist in the Coast Guard should apply at a Coast Guard Recruiting Office, or direct inquiries to, Coast Guard Recruiting Center, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 450, Arlington, VA 22203. Enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be for general service and enlisted persons may be transferred as necessary from one unit to another. Original enlistments will be made only at regular recruiting offices unless otherwise directed by the Commandant. An original enlistment is the enlistment of an individual who has not had previous service in the Regular Coast Guard. In processing an application for enlistment, the Coast Guard will determine the mental, moral and physical fitness of the applicant through reference to local police files, character references, employers, school authorities and physical and mental examinations. Concealment of any fact, circumstance or condition existing prior to enlistment which would render the applicant ineligible for enlistment may subject the applicant to criminal penalties under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or administrative separation from the Coast Guard.</P>

            <P>(a) The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to establish a Discharge Review Board (DRB) to review the discharge of a former member of the United States Coast Guard under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1553. This part prescribes the establishment and outlines the procedures of the Coast <PRTPAGE P="122"/>Guard Discharge Review Board. The Secretary retains the authority to review and take final action on the DRB's findings in the following cases:</P>
            <P>(1) Those cases in which a minority of the board requests that their written opinion be forwarded to the Secretary for consideration;</P>
            <P>(2) Those cases selected by the Commandant to inform the Secretary of aspects of the board's functions which may be of interest to the Secretary;</P>
            <P>(3) Any case in which the Secretary demonstrates an interest;</P>
            <P>(4) Any case which the President of the board believes is of significant interest to the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(b) The Commandant of the Coast Guard is delegated the authority to:</P>
            <P>(1) Appoint members to serve on the Discharge Review Board;</P>
            <P>(2) Appoint alternates to serve on the DRB in the event that a regularly appointed member is unavailable;</P>
            <P>(3) Designate a member as the President of the DRB; and</P>
            <P>(4) Review and take final action on all DRB decisions which are not reviewed by the Secretary.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The provisions of this part apply to the United States Coast Guard including reserve-components and all former members who have been discharged within 15 years of the date upon which application for review is received by the DRB. A former member may apply to the DRB for a change in the character of, and/or the reason for, the discharge. The Coast Guard DRB review is generally applicable only to administrative discharges, however, the DRB may review the discharge of a former member by sentence of a court-martial for the purpose of clemency. A petition for clemency will not be considered by the DRB unless the applicant has exhausted all appellate remedies. Upon a petition for clemency, the DRB shall consider only the equity of the discharge awarded.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Objective of review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The objective of the discharge review is to examine the propriety and equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes if necessary. The DRB will utilize its discretion to reach a fair and just resolution of the applicant's claim. The standards of review and the underlying factors which aid in determining whether the standards are met shall be historically consistent with criteria for determining honorable service. No factors shall be established which require automatic change, or denial of change, in a discharge.</P>

            <P>A discharge is deemed to be proper except that:</P>
            <P>(a) A discharge may be improper if an error of fact, law, procedure, or discretion was associated with the discharge at the time of issuance which prejudiced the rights of the applicant.</P>
            <P>(b) A discharge may be improper if there has been a change in policy by the Coast Guard made expressly retroactive to the type of discharge under consideration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Equity standard of review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A discharge is presumed to be equitable and will not be changed under this section unless the applicant submits evidence sufficient to establish, to the satisfaction of the DRB that:</P>
            <P>(1) The policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of that type, provided that current policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded a party in such proceedings, and there is substantial doubt that the applicant would have received the same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures had been available to the applicant at the time of the discharge proceedings under consideration; or</P>
            <P>(2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with standards of discipline in the Coast Guard; or</P>
            <P>(3) The applicant's military record and other evidence presented to the DRB, viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in § 51.8 and the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, do not fairly justify the type of discharge received.</P>
            <P>(b) If the applicant was discharged with a characterized discharge before June 15, 1983, a change from the characterized discharge to an uncharacterized discharge will not be considered under the provisions of (a)(1) of this section unless specifically requested by the applicant. A determination that a discharge is inequitable according to the provisions of (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall entitle the applicant to a discharge of a type to which the applicant was entitled at the time the original discharge was issued.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Relevant considerations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In determining the equity and propriety of a former member's discharge, the DRB shall consider all relevant evidence presented by the applicant. The DRB review will include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:</P>
            <P>(a) The quality of the applicant's service. In determining the quality of the applicant's service, the DRB may consider the applicant's dates and periods of service; rate or rank achieved; marks and evaluations received; awards, decorations and letters of commendation; acts of merit; combat service and wounds received; promotions and demotions; prior military service and type of discharge; records of unauthorized absence; records of non-judicial punishment; convictions by court-martial; records of conviction by civil authorities while a member of the Coast Guard; and any other relevant information respecting the applicant which is brought to the board's attention.</P>

            <P>(b) The applicant's capability to serve. In determining the applicant's <PRTPAGE P="124"/>capability to serve, the DRB considers such factors as the applicant's age and education; qualification for reenlistment; capability to adjust to military service; and family or personal problems.</P>
            <P>(c) Any evidence of arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory actions by individuals in authority over the applicant.</P>
            <P>(d) Any other information respecting the applicant considered by the DRB to be relevant and material to the review of the applicant's discharge.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Discharge review procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Preliminary.</E> Prior to a review, applicants or their representatives may obtain copies of military records by submitting a Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9799 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, MO. 72132. The request to the NPRC should be submitted prior to submitting the application for review, so that relevant information from the record can be included with the application.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Initiation of review.</E> Review may be initiated by an applicant or by the DRB. The applicant may apply for DRB review of discharge by submitting DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or Separation from the Armed Forces of the United States, along with any other statements, affidavits or documentation desired by the applicant. The application must be received by the DRB within fifteen (15) years of the date of the discharge. The application form can be obtained, along with explanatory matter, from Commandant (CG-12), Attn: Personnel Management Directorate, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7907, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7907, any regional VA office, or by writing to the Armed Forces Review/Correction Board Reading Room, Pentagon Concourse, Washington, DC 20310.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice.</E> (1) The DRB will provide notification advising the former member of—</P>
            <P>(i) Receipt of the applicant's request;</P>
            <P>(ii) The right to appear before the board in person or by counsel; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The date of review.</P>
            <FP>If the former member is deceased, written notice of DRB review will be sent to the surviving spouse, next of kin or legal representative of the former member. If the review is initiated by the DRB, notification will be sent to the last known address of the former member.</FP>
            <P>(2) Prior to the initiation of the decision process, the DRB will notify the former member of the date by which requests to examine the documents to be considered by the board must be received. This notice will also state the date by which a request for a hearing must be made and the deadline for filing responses to the board.</P>
            <P>(3) An applicant who requests a hearing will be notified of the time and place of the hearing. All expenses incurred by the applicant in DRB proceedings and hearings are the sole responsibility of the applicant and are not obligations of the U.S. Coast Guard or the Department of Transportation. If the applicant fails to appear, except as provided in § 51.9(f), the DRB will review the discharge and reach a decision based upon the evidence of record.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Withdrawal of application.</E> An applicant may withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review. An application which is withdrawn will not stay the running of the 15 year statutory limitation imposed on the authority of the DRB to review the discharge.</P>
            <P>(e) The DRB will consider the records and other data submitted by the applicant. The DRB may consider other probative evidence provided that all materials relied on by the DRB, except classified documents, are made available to the applicant and applicant's representative prior to the hearing date (or review date if no hearing is requested). The DRB shall not consider a classified document in the review of a discharge unless a summary of, or extract from, the document (deleting all reference to sources of information and other matters, the disclosure of which would, in the opinion of the classifying authority, be detrimental to the security interests of the United States) is made available to the applicant.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Postponement of review or hearing.</E> At any time before the date of scheduled review or hearing, an applicant <PRTPAGE P="125"/>may be granted a continuance, provided the applicant or the applicant's counsel makes a written request for additional time to the DRB which shows good cause to justify the postponement.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Hearing procedures.</E> The following procedures apply to DRB hearings:</P>
            <P>(1) DRB hearings are not public. Presence at hearings is limited to persons authorized by the Commandant or expressly requested by the applicant, subject to reasonable limitations based upon available space.</P>
            <P>(2) The Federal Rules of Evidence are not applicable to DRB proceedings. The presiding officer rules on matters of procedure and ensures that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are adhered to in the taking of evidence.</P>
            <P>(3) An applicant is permitted to make a sworn or unsworn statement. Witness testimony will only be taken under oath or affirmation. An applicant or witness who makes a statement may be questioned by the DRB.</P>
            <P>(4) An applicant may make oral or written argument personally or through his or her representative.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Reconsideration.</E> The decision of the DRB may not be reconsidered unless—</P>
            <P>(1) The only previous consideration of the case was on the motion of the DRB;</P>
            <P>(2) Changes in discharge policy occur; or</P>
            <P>(3) New, substantial, relevant evidence, not available to the applicant at the time of the original review, is submitted to the DRB.</P>

            <P>(a) The Inspector General, Department of Homeland Security shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Expeditiously determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation of an allegation that a personnel action has been taken, withheld, or threatened in reprisal for making or preparing to make a protected communication.

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Coast Guard administers the U.S. Aids to Navigation System. The system consists of Federal aids to navigation operated by the Coast Guard, aids to navigation operated by the other armed services, and private aids to navigation operated by other persons.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) This part describes the general characteristics of the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, and the details, policies and procedures employed by the Coast Guard in establishing, maintaining, operating, changing or discontinuing Federal aids to navigation. Regulations concerning the marking of wrecks, structures, and other obstructions are found in 33 CFR part 64. Regulations concerning private aids are found in 33 CFR part 66. Regulations concerning the marking of artificial islands and structures which are erected on or over the seabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States or its possessions are found in 33 CFR part 67. Regulations concerning the marking of bridges are found in 33 CFR part 118. Regulations concerning aids to navigation at deepwater ports are found in subchapter NN of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The regulations found in 33 CFR subpart 66.10 expire on December 31, 2003, at which time the provisions of this part will apply.</P>
              <P>(c) The Coast Guard maintains systems of marine aids to navigation consisting of visual, audible, and electronic signals which are designed to assist the prudent mariner in the process of navigation. The aids to navigation system is not intended to identify every shoal or obstruction to navigation which exists in the navigable waters of the United States, but rather provides for reasonable marking of marine features as resources permit. The primary objective of the aids to navigation system is to mark navigable channels and waterways, obstructions adjacent to these waterways, and obstructions in areas of general navigation which may not be anticipated. Other waters, even if navigable, are generally not marked.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The navigable waters of the United States and non-navigable State waters after December 31, 2003, are marked to assist navigation using the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, a system consistent with the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Maritime Buoyage System. The IALA Maritime Buoyage System is followed by most of the world's maritime nations and will improve maritime safety by encouraging conformity in buoyage systems worldwide. IALA buoyage is divided into two regions made up of Region A and Region B. All navigable waters of the United States follow IALA Region B, except U.S. possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 10 degrees north latitude, which follow IALA Region A. Lateral aids to navigation in Region A vary from those described throughout this Subpart. Non-lateral aids to navigation are the same as those used in Region B. See § 62.25. Appropriate nautical charts and publications should be consulted to determine whether the Region A or Region B marking schemes are in effect for a given area.</P>
              <P>(b) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with nautical charts. Nautical charts portray the physical features of the marine environment, including soundings and other submarine features, landmarks, and other aids necessary for the proper navigation of a vessel. This crucial information cannot be obtained from other sources, even ones such as topographic maps, aeronautical charts, or atlases. The exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear to the mariner unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the chart illustrates the relationship of the individual aid to navigation to channel limits, obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the total aids to navigation system.</P>

              <P>(c) The navigator should maintain and consult suitable publications and instruments for navigation depending on the vessel's requirements. This shipboard equipment is separate from the aids to navigation system, but is often <PRTPAGE P="143"/>essential to its use. The following publications are available from the U.S. Government to assist the navigator:</P>

              <P>(1) The Light List, published by the Coast Guard and available for viewing on the Coast Guard Navigation Center Web site at <E T="03">http://www.navcen.uscg.gov</E> lists federal and private aids to navigation. It includes all major Federal aids to navigation and those private aids to navigation that have been deemed to be important to general navigation, and includes a physical description of these aids and their locations.</P>

              <P>(2) The United States Coast Pilot, published by the National Ocean Service and available from NOAA Certified Printer Partners listed at <E T="03">http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/NOAAChartViewer.html.</E> Free on-line versions and weekly updates supplement the information shown on nautical charts, and are available directly from NOAA at <E T="03">http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/cpdownload.htm.</E> Subjects such as local navigation regulations, channel and anchorage peculiarities, dangers, climatalogical data, routes, and port facilities are covered.</P>

              <P>(3) Local Notices to Mariners are published by local Coast Guard District Commanders. Persons may view Local Notices to Mariners on the Coast Guard Navigation Center Web site at <E T="03">http://www.navcen.uscg.gov.</E> Changes to aids to navigation, reported dangers, scheduled construction or other disruptions, chart corrections and similar useful marine information is made available through this publication.</P>

              <P>(4) The Notice to Mariners is a national publication, similar to the Local Notice to Mariners, published by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The notices may be viewed on the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's Web site at <E T="03">http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal.</E> This publication provides oceangoing vessels significant information on national and international navigation and safety.</P>
              <P>(5) The mariner should also listen to Coast Guard Broadcast Notices to Mariners. These broadcasts update the Local Notice to Mariners with more timely information. Mariners should monitor VHF-FM channel 16 to locate Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts.</P>
              <P>(d) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is primarily a lateral system which employs a simple arrangement of colors, shapes, numbers, and light characteristics to mark the limits of navigable routes. This lateral system is supplemented by nonlateral aids to navigation where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) Generally, lateral aids to navigation indicate on which side of a vessel an aid to navigation should be passed when the vessel is proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Normally, the Conventional Direction of Buoyage is the direction in which a vessel enters navigable channels from seaward and proceeds towards the head of navigation. In the absence of a route leading from seaward, the Conventional Direction of Buoyage generally follows a clockwise direction around land masses. For example, proceeding southerly along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Texas along the Gulf Coast, and northerly along the Pacific Coast are considered as proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. In some instances, this direction must be arbitrarily assigned. Where doubt exists, the mariner should consult charts and other nautical publications.</P>
              <P>(f) Although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonable degree of reliability, the rigors of the marine environment and various equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.</P>
              <P>(g) The Coast Guard makes reasonable efforts to inform the navigator of known discrepancies, and to correct them within a reasonable period of time, depending upon resources available. Occasionally, a temporary aid to navigation, which provides different but similar service, is deployed until permanent repairs can be made to the original aid. Notification of such temporary changes is made through the notice to mariners system.</P>

              <P>(h) Mariners should exercise caution when using private aids to navigation because private aids are often established to serve the needs of specific users rather than general navigation and their purpose may not be obvious to casual users; and, discrepancies to <PRTPAGE P="144"/>private aids are often detected, reported, and corrected less promptly than discrepancies to Coast Guard aids to navigation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Beacons and buoys.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Aids to navigation are placed on shore or on marine sites to assist a navigator to determine his position or safe course. They may mark limits of navigable channels, or warn of dangers or obstructions to navigation. The primary components of the U.S. Aids to Navigation System are beacons and buoys.</P>
              <P>(b) Beacons are aids to navigation structures which are permanently fixed to the earth's surface. They range from large lighthouses to small, single-pile structures and may be located on land or in the water. Lighted beacons are called lights; unlighted beacons are called daybeacons.</P>
              <P>(1) Beacons exhibit a daymark. For small structures these are colored geometric shapes which make an aid to navigation readily visible and easily identifiable against background conditions. Generally, the daymark conveys to the mariner, during daylight hours, the same significance as does the aid's light or reflector at night. The daymark of large lighthouses and towers, however, consists of the structure itself. As a result, these daymarks do not infer lateral significance.</P>
              <P>(2) Vessels should not pass beacons close aboard due to the danger of collision with rip-rap or structure foundations, or the obstruction or danger that the aid marks.</P>
              <P>(c) Buoys are floating aids to navigation used extensively throughout U.S. waters. They are moored to the seabed by sinkers with chain or other moorings of various lengths.</P>
              <P>(1) The daymark of a buoy is the color and shape of the buoy and, if so equipped, of the topmark.</P>
              <P>(i) Can buoys have a cylindrical shape.</P>
              <P>(ii) Nun buoys have a tapered, conical shape.</P>
              <P>(iii) Pillar buoys have a wide cylindrical base supporting a narrower superstructure. They may be surmounted by colored shapes called topmarks.</P>
              <P>(iv) Spherical buoys have a round shape.</P>
              <P>(2) Mariners attempting to pass a buoy close aboard risk collision with a yawing buoy, the buoy's mooring, or with the obstruction which the buoy marks.</P>
              <P>(3) Mariners should not rely on buoys alone for determining their positions due to factors limiting their reliability. Prudent mariners will use bearings or angles from beacons or other landmarks, soundings, and various methods of electronic navigation. Buoys vary in reliability because:</P>
              <P>(i) Buoy positions represented on nautical charts are approximate positions only, due to practical limitations in positioning and maintaining buoys and their sinkers in precise geographical locations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Buoy moorings vary in length. The mooring lengths define a “watch circle”, and buoys can be expected to move within this circle. Actual watch circles do not coincide with the dots or circles representing them on charts.</P>
              <P>(iii) Buoy positions are normally verified during periodic maintenance visits. Between visits, environmental conditions, including atmospheric and sea conditions, and seabed slope and composition, may shift buoys off their charted positions. Also buoys may be dragged off station, sunk, or capsized by a collision with a vessel.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Lateral marks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Lateral marks define the port and starboard sides of a route to be followed. They may be either beacons or buoys.</P>

              <P>(b) Sidemarks are lateral marks which advise the mariner to stay to one side of the mark. Their most frequent use is to mark the sides of channels; however, they may be used individually to mark obstructions outside of clearly defined channels. Sidemarks are not always placed directly on a channel edge and may be positioned outside the channel as indicated on charts and nautical publications.<PRTPAGE P="145"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Port hand marks indicate the left side of channels when proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have green square daymarks, while buoys are green can or pillar buoys.</P>
              <P>(2) Starboard hand marks indicate the right side of channels when proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have red triangular daymarks, while buoys are red nun or pillar buoys.</P>
              <P>(c) Preferred channel marks indicate channel junctions or bifurcations and may also mark wrecks or obstructions which the mariner, after consulting a chart to ascertain the location of the obstruction relative to the aid, may pass on either side. Preferred channel marks have red and green horizontal bands with the color of the topmost band indicating the preferred channel. If the topmost band is green, the mark serves as a port hand mark for vessels following the preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and as a starboard hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have square daymarks, while buoys would be can or pillar buoys. If the topmost band is red, the mark serves as a starboard hand mark for vessels following the preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and a port hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have triangular daymarks, while buoys would be nun or pillar buoys.</P>
              <P>(d) The above color schemes apply to IALA Region B. Marks located in the IALA Region A exhibit reversed color significance: port hand marks will be red when following the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and starboard hand marks will be green. The meaning of daymark and buoy shapes is identical in both regions.</P>
              <P>(e) Certain marks on the Intracoastal Waterway may exhibit reversed lateral significance. See § 62.49.</P>

              <P>(b) The black and white buoy's meaning is “do not pass between the buoy and the shore”. The number of white and black stripes is discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the width of the black stripes. Prior to December 31, 2003, this aid shall not be used on a waterway which has a red and white striped obstruction marker <PRTPAGE P="146"/>defined in § 66.10-15(e)(3) of this chapter, unless all obstruction markers are replaced.</P>

              <P>(a) Information and Regulatory Marks are used to alert the mariner to various warnings or regulatory matters. These marks have orange geometric shapes against a white background. The meanings associated with the orange shapes are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A vertical open-faced diamond signifies danger.</P>
              <P>(2) A vertical diamond shape having a cross centered within indicates that vessels are excluded from the marked area.</P>
              <P>(3) A circular shape indicates that certain operating restrictions are in effect within the marked area.</P>
              <P>(4) A square or rectangular shape will contain directions or instructions lettered within the shape.</P>
              <P>(b) When a buoy is used as an information or regulatory mark it shall be white with two horizontal orange bands placed completely around the buoy circumference. One band shall be near the top of the buoy body, with a second band placed just above the waterline of the buoy so that both bands are clearly visible.</P>

The appropriate nautical chart must be consulted when using ranges to determine whether the range marks the centerline of the navigable channel and also to ascertain what section of the range may be safety traversed. Ranges are generally, but not always, lighted, and display rectangular daymarks of various colors.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Numbers and letters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All solid red and solid green aids are numbered, with red aids bearing even numbers and green aids bearing odd numbers. The numbers for each increase in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Numbers are kept in approximately sequence on both sides of the channel by omitting numbers where necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) Only sidemarks are numbered. However, aids other than those mentioned above may be lettered to assist in their identification, or to indicate their purpose. Sidemarks may carry letters in addition to numbers to identify the first aid to navigation in a waterway, or when new aids to navigation are added to channels with previously completed numerical sequences. Letters on sidemarks will follow alphabetical order from seaward and proceeding toward the Conventional Direction of Buoyage and will be added to numbers as suffixes.</P>
              <P>(c) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material to increase their visibility in darkness. The colors of this material may convey the same significance as the aid except that letters and numbers may be white.</P>
              <P>(d) Exceptions to the provisions of this section will be found on the Western Rivers System. See § 62.51.</P>

              <P>(e) The guidelines for the display of numbers and letters on aids to navigation are identical for both Region A and Region B; red aids to navigation <PRTPAGE P="147"/>display even numbers, and green aids display odd numbers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Light characteristics.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Lights on aids to navigation are differentiated by color and rhythm. Lighthouses and range lights may display distinctive light characteristics to facilitate recognition. No special significance should be attached to the color or rhythm of such lights. Other lighted aids to navigation employ light characteristics to convey additional information.</P>
              <P>(b) When proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, aids to navigation, if lighted, display light characteristics as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Green lights mark port (left) sides of channels and locations of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping these lights on the port (left) hand of a vessel. Green lights are also used on Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is green.</P>
              <P>(2) Red lights mark starboard (right) sides of channels and locations of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping these lights on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel. Red lights are also used on Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is red.</P>
              <P>(3) Certain lights marking the Intracoastal Waterway may display reversed lateral significance. See § 62.49.</P>
              <P>(c) Yellow lights have no lateral significance. Except on the Western Rivers, see § 62.51, white lights have no lateral significance. The purpose of aids exhibiting white or yellow lights may be determined by their shape, color, letters or numbers, and the light rhythm employed.</P>
              <P>(d) Light rhythms, except as noted in § 62.51 for the Western Rivers, are employed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Aids with lateral significance display regularly flashing or regularly occulting light rhythms. Ordinarily, flashing lights (frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute) will be used.</P>
              <P>(2) Preferred Channel Marks display a composite group flashing light rhythm (groups of two flashes followed by one flash).</P>
              <P>(3) Safe Water Marks display a white Morse Code “A” rhythm (short-long flash).</P>
              <P>(4) Isolated Danger Marks display a white group flashing two.</P>
              <P>(5) Special Marks display yellow lights with fixed or slow flashing rhythm preferred.</P>
              <P>(6) Mooring Buoys and Information and Regulatory Marks display white lights of various rhythms.</P>
              <P>(7) For situations where lights require a distinct cautionary significance, as at sharp turns, sudden channel constrictions, wrecks, or obstructions, a quick flashing light rhythm (60 flashes per minute) may be used.</P>
              <P>(e) Occasionally lights use sectors to mark shoals or warn mariners of other dangers. Lights so equipped show one color from most directions and a different color or colors over definite arcs of the horizon as indicated on the appropriate nautical chart. These sectors provide approximate bearing information since the observer should note a change of color as the boundary between the sectors is crossed. As sector bearings are not precise, they should be considered a warning only and not used to determine exact bearing to the light.</P>
              <P>(f) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material to increase their visibility in darkness. Green or red reflective material is used only on marks which, if lighted, would exhibit a light of that color. Yellow reflective material is used on special marks and on Intracoastal Waterway marks. No significance is attached to white reflective material.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sound signals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Often sound signals are located on or adjacent to aids to navigation. When visual signals are obscured, sound signals warn mariners of the proximity of danger.</P>
              <P>(1) Sound signals are distinguished by their tone and phase characteristics.</P>

              <P>(i) Tones are determined by the devices producing the sound (i.e., diaphones, diaphragm horns, reed horns, sirens, whistles, bells and gongs).<PRTPAGE P="148"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Phase characteristics are defined by the signal's sound pattern, i.e., the number of blasts and silent periods per minute and their durations. Sound signals emanating from fixed structures generally produce a specific number of blasts and silent periods each minute when operating. Buoy sound signals are generally actuated by the motion of the sea and therefore do not emit a regular signal characteristic.</P>
              <P>(2) Where no live watch is maintained, sound signals are normally operated continuously. However, some are equipped with fog detectors which activate sound signals when visibility falls below a predetermined limit.</P>
              <P>(b) Mariners should not rely solely on sound signals to determine their positions for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) Distance cannot be accurately determined by sound intensity.</P>
              <P>(2) Occasionally sound signals may not be heard in areas close to their location.</P>
              <P>(3) Signals may not sound in cases where fog exists close to, but not at, the location of the sound signal.</P>
              <P>(4) As buoy signals are generally activated by sea motion, they may produce no signals when seas are calm.</P>
              <P>(5) As previously noted, buoy positions are not always reliable. Therefore their sound signals cannot be assumed to be emanating from a fixed position.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Intracoastal Waterway identification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In addition to the conventional signals, aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waters.</P>
              <P>(1) Yellow triangles indicate that aids to navigation so marked should be passed keeping them on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel, regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.</P>
              <P>(2) Yellow squares indicate that aids to navigation so marked should be passed keeping them on the port (left) hand of a vessel, regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.</P>
              <P>(3) A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.</P>
              <P>(b) The above guidelines apply for vessels traversing the Intracoastal Waterway in a southerly direction on the Atlantic Coast, in a westerly direction on the Okeechobee Waterway, or in a westerly direction along the Gulf Coast.</P>

              <P>(a) A variation of the standard U.S. aids to navigation system described above is employed on the Mississippi River and tributaries above Baton Rouge, LA and on certain other rivers which flow toward the Gulf of Mexico.</P>
              <P>(b) The Western Rivers System varies from the standard U.S. system as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Buoys are not numbered.</P>
              <P>(2) Numbers on beacons do not have odd/even lateral significance but, rather, indicate mileage from a fixed point (normally the river mouth).</P>
              <P>(3) Diamond-shaped non-lateral dayboards, checkered red-and-white or green-and-white, similar to those used in the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, as appropriate, are used as crossing dayboards where the river channel crosses from one bank to the other.</P>
              <P>(4) Lights on green buoys and on beacons with green daymarks show a single flash which may be green or white.</P>
              <P>(5) Lights on red buoys and on beacons with red daymarks show a double flash [Group Flashing (2)] which may be red or white.</P>

              <P>(a) Aids to Navigation (AtoN) may be enhanced by the use of an automatic identification system (AIS). AIS is a maritime navigation safety communications protocol standardized by the International Telecommunication Union and adopted by the International Maritime Organization for the broadcast or exchange of navigation information between vessels, aircraft, and shore stations. AIS AtoN can autonomously and at fixed intervals <PRTPAGE P="149"/>broadcast the name, position, dimensions, type, characteristics and status from or concerning an aid to navigation.</P>
              <P>(b) AIS AtoN can be either real (physically fitted to the AtoN), synthetic (physically fitted somewhere other than to the AtoN) or virtual (physically nonexistent, but capable of being portrayed on AIS-capable displays).</P>

              <P>(c) AIS AtoN can also be used to broadcast both laterally (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Port Hand Mark) and non-laterally significant marine safety information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> environmental data, tidal information, and navigation warnings).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Racons.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Aids to navigation may be enhanced by the use of radar beacons (racons). Racons, when triggered by a radar signal, will transmit a coded reply to the interrogating radar. This reply serves to identify the aid station by exhibiting a series of dots and dashes which appear on the radar display in a line emanating radially from just beyond the echo of the aid station. Although racons may be used on both laterally significant and non-laterally significant aids alike, the racon signal itself is for identification purposes only, and therefore carries no lateral significance.</P>
              <P>(b) Racons are also used as bridge marks to mark the best point of passage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedure for reporting defects and discrepancies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Mariners should notify the nearest Coast Guard facility immediately of any observed aids to navigation defects or discrepancies.</P>
              <P>(b) The Coast Guard cannot monitor the many thousands of aids in the U.S. Aids to Navigation System simultaneously and continuously. As a result, it is not possible to maintain every aid operating properly and on its charted position at all times. Marine safety will be enhanced if persons finding aids missing, sunk, capsized, damaged, off station, or showing characteristics other than those advertised in the Light List, or other publication, promptly inform the Coast Guard. When making the report to the Coast Guard the mariner should consult the Light List to ensure the correct geographical information is used due to the similarity of names and geographical areas.</P>
              <P>(c) Procedures for reporting defects and discrepancies:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Radio messages</E> should be prefixed “Coast Guard” and transmitted directly to a Government shore radio station listed in Chapter three of Radio Navigation Aids Publication, 117, for relay to the relevant District Commander.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Telephone, e-mail, or facsimile messages may also be used to advise the nearest Coast Guard unit of defects or discrepancies in aids to navigation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State waters for private aids to navigation; designations; revisions, and revocations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A State Administrator who desires to regulate State maritime aids to navigation in the navigable waters of the United States not marked by the Federal Government, shall request the Commandant to designate the specific bodies of water involved as State waters for private aids to navigation.</P>
              <P>(b) The request shall be forwarded to the District Commander in whose district the bodies of water are located. The request shall give the name and description of the waterway; the extent of use being made of the waterway for marine navigation, in general terms; an appropriate chart or sketch of the area; and a general outline of the nature and extent of the State aids to navigation which the Administrator plans to establish in the waterway.</P>
              <P>(c) The District Commander shall review the request and consult with the State Administrator concerning the terms of an initial agreement to be entered into under provisions of § 66.05-20. When they have arrived at terms of an agreement satisfactory to both, the District Commander shall forward the request to the Commandant with recommendations and the terms of agreement mutually settled upon. If they cannot reach such agreement, the District Commander shall forward the request with recommendations and a statement of the points agreed upon and the points remaining at issue.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of the request, the Commandant will determine whether or not approval of the request is in the public interest and will inform the State Administrator and the District Commander of the Coast Guard's decision. If the request is approved, the designation by the Commandant of the waters in question as State waters for private aids to navigation will be also defined and described in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) The Commandant may, upon his or her own initiative or upon request, revoke or revise any designations of State waters for private aids to navigation previously made by him or her. Written notice shall be given the State Administrator of the action contemplated by the Commandant. The State Administrator will be afforded a period of not less than 30 days from the date of the notice in which to inform the Commandant of the State's views in the matter before final action is completed to revoke or revise such designation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Coast Guard-State agreements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The District Commander in whose District a waterway is located may enter into agreements with State Administrators permitting a State to regulate aids to navigation, including regulatory markers, in State waters for private aids to navigation, as, in the opinion of the District Commander, the State is able to do in a manner to improve the safety of navigation. When a waterway is located within the area of jurisdiction of more than one Coast Guard District, the District Commander in whose District the State capital is located shall execute the agreement in behalf of the Coast Guard. All such agreements shall reserve to the District Commander the right to inspect the State aids to navigation without prior notice to the State. They shall stipulate that State aids to navigation will conform to the Uniform State Waterway marking System or to the U.S. Aids to Navigation System and that the State Administrator will modify or remove State aids to navigation without expense to the United States when so directed by the District Commander, subject to the right of appeal on the part of the State Administrator to the Commandant.</P>
              <P>(b) A Coast Guard-State agreement shall become effective when both parties have signed the agreements. In lieu of the procedure prescribed in § 66.01-5, the agreement shall constitute blanket approval by the Commandant, of the State aids to navigation, including regulatory markers, established or to be established in State waters for private aids to navigation designated or to be designated by the Commandant.</P>

              <P>(c) In addition to the matters set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, Coast Guard-State agreements shall cover the following points, together <PRTPAGE P="159"/>with such other matters as the parties find it desirable to include:</P>
              <P>(1) A description, in sufficient detail for publication in Notices to Mariners, of all aids to navigations under State jurisdiction in navigable waters of the United States in existence prior to the effective date of the agreement which have not been previously approved under procedures of § 66.01-5.</P>
              <P>(2) Procedures for use by the State administrator to notify the District Commander of changes made in State aids to navigation, as required by § 66.05-25.</P>
              <P>(3) If prior to December 21, 2003, specification of the marking system to be used, whether the U.S. Aids to Navigation System or the Uniform State Waterway Marking System.</P>
              <P>(4) Specification of standards as to minimum size and shape of markers, the use of identifying letters, the use of reflectors or retroreflective materials, and any other similar standards so as to enable Coast Guard inspectors to determine compliance with Statewide standards.</P>

              <P>(b) On a well defined channel including a river or other relatively narrow natural or improved waterway, an aid to navigation shall normally be a solid colored buoy. A buoy which marks the <PRTPAGE P="161"/>left side of the channel viewed looking upstream or toward the head of navigation shall be colored all black. A buoy which marks the right side of the channel viewed looking upstream or toward the head of navigation shall be colored all red. On a well defined channel, solid colored buoys shall be established in pairs, one on each side of the navigable channel which they mark, and opposite each other to inform the user that the channel lies between the buoys and that the user should pass between the buoys.</P>
              <P>(c) On an irregularly defined channel, solid colored buoys may be used singly in staggered fashion on alternate sides of the channel provided they are spaced at sufficiently close intervals to inform the user that the channel lies between the buoys and that the user should pass between the buoys.</P>
              <P>(d) Where there is no well-defined channel or when a body of water is obstructed by objects whose nature or location is such that the obstruction can be approached by a vessel from more than one direction, supplemental aids to navigation having cardinal meaning (i.e., pertaining to the cardinal points of the compass, north, east, south, and west) may be used. The use of an aid to navigation having cardinal meaning is discretionary provided that the use of such a marker is limited to wholly State owned waters and the State waters for private aids to navigation as defined and described in this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Aids to navigation conforming to the cardinal system shall consist of three distinctly colored buoys.</P>
              <P>(1) A white buoy with a red top may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that the operator must pass to the south or west of the buoy.</P>
              <P>(2) A white buoy with a black top may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that the operator must pass to the north or east of the buoy.</P>
              <P>(3) In addition, a buoy showing alternate vertical red and white stripes may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction to navigation extends from the nearest shore to the buoy and that the operator must not pass between the buoy and shore. The number of white and red stripes is discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the width of the red stripes.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When will structures be assigned to a Class?</E> The District Commander will assign structures to Class A, B, or C as part of processing an application for a permit to establish and operate lights and sound signals.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">In general, where will the different classes of structures be located?</E> Specific criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may create exceptions, but, in general, structures the farthest from shore are likely to be assigned to Class A and required to have obstruction lights and sound signals that can be detected from the farthest distance. Structures closest to shore are likely to be assigned to Class C and, while subject to requirements to ensure that they are also detectable from a safe distance away, will be required to have the least powerful obstruction lights or sound signals. The location and standards for Class B structures will generally be in between Class A and C structures.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What criteria will be used to classify structures?</E> When assigning a structure to a class, the District Commander will take into consideration whether a line of demarcation has been prescribed, and matters concerning, but not necessarily limited to, the dimensions of the structure and the depth of water in which it is located, the proximity of the structure to vessel routes, the nature and amount of vessel traffic, and the effect of background lighting.</P>
              <P>(1) If a line of demarcation has been prescribed, the District Commander will assign those structures seaward of the line of demarcation to Class A. He or she will assign all structures shoreward of the line of demarcation to either Class B or Class C, unless the District Commander determines under § 67.05-25 that the structure should be assigned to Class A because of the structure's proximity to a navigable channel, fairway or line of demarcation.</P>
              <P>(2) If a line of demarcation has not been prescribed, the District Commander will assign a structure to Class A, B, or C as he or she deems appropriate.</P>

              <P>(c) Structures having a horizontal dimension of over 50 feet on any one side, or in diameter, shall be required to have an obstruction light on each corner, or 90° apart in the case of circular structures, or as prescribed by the District Commander, each light to have a 360° lens.</P>
              <P>(d) Where the overall dimensions of a structure require the installation of two or more obstruction lights, the lights shall all be mounted on the same horizontal plane within the limitations of height specified in § 67.20-5, § 67.25-5, or § 67.30-5, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(e) Lesser structures and piles, pile clusters or flare templates, etc., will not normally be required to be marked by obstruction lights, when they are located within 100 yards of a Class “A”, “B” or “C” structure marked by established obstruction lights, but they shall be marked with red or white retro-reflective material, installed as prescribed by the District Commander.</P>
              <P>(f) All obstruction lights shall be installed in a manner which will permit at least one of them to be carried in sight of the mariner, regardless of the angle of approach, until the mariner is within 50 feet of the structure, visibility permitting.</P>

Persons constructing structures must notify the District Commander by either telegram or overnight mail on the day they begin construction. Within this notice, they must inform him or her of the lights and sound signals they will use during construction. When construction has been completed, the maintainer shall notify the District Commander to that effect by letter, stating whether or not the authorized obstruction lights and/or sound signals are in operation. Final notification by letter shall be given when the lights used for general illumination, to facilitate the construction or operation of the structure, have been discontinued and the authorized obstruction lights placed in operation.</P>

The primary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the seaward of which Class “A” requirements are imposed. The secondary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the shoreward of which Class “C” requirements are imposed. In those areas where no secondary line of demarcation is prescribed, the structures shoreward of the primary line of demarcation are considered to be Class “C” structures. Class “B” requirements are imposed on the structures in the areas between the two lines of demarcation.</P>

              <P>(2) All buoys used during seismographic operations shall be painted with international orange and white horizontal bands. The buoys shall be of light construction in order that they will not present a hazard to marine commerce.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Spoil marking.</E> (1) All submerged spoil resulting from the dredging of channels, laying of pipelines, or any other operation, which constitutes an obstruction to navigation, shall be properly marked. The spoil banks should be examined at frequent intervals in order that the changing conditions may be kept under control. As markers are no longer required due to settling of banks, the Coast Guard will authorize their removal upon application.</P>
              <P>(2) All openings in such submerged spoil shall be marked by daybeacons on each side of the openings. When spoil is located on each side of a channel or pipe line, each bank will be considered separately. The daybeacons shall be equipped with arrows designating the safe water through the opening. These daybeacons may also be used as channel markers for the dredged channels providing they are also equipped with arrows designating the spoil bank openings.</P>
              <P>(3) When spoil banks constituting an obstruction to navigation abut an established traveled waterway, the outboard spoil bank markers shall be equipped with quick flashing lights described in Subpart 67.30 of this part, except that the color shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 62.25 of Part 62 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applications.</E> All applications for private aids to navigation and all correspondence dealing with private aids to navigation and obstruction lighting must be addressed to Commander (oan), Eighth Coast Guard District, Hale Boggs Federal Building, 501 Magazine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130-3396.</P>

          <EXTRACT>

            <P>a. Article III of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisons at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), done at London, October 20, 1972, as rectified by Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, provides that a party may notify the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO, formerly Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization or IMCO) that it extends the application of the Convention to territory for which it is responsible for international relations. Since it is the intention of the United States that the 72 COLREGS apply to all U.S. territories and possessions to the same extent that the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1960 (60 COLREGS) (16 USC 794, TIAS 5813) previously applied, the United States has given notice to the Secretary-General that the provisions of the 1972 COLREGS are applicable on July 15, 1977, to the following territories and possessions for which the United States is responsible for international relations:

            <P>Because earlier formulations of the COLREGS were not elaborated as treaties, they came into force by the almost simultaneous enactment of domestic legislation by the majority of maritime nations. The COLREGS were judicially considered as being customary international law, that is to say international law based upon the consensus of maritime nations rather than upon an express instrument. Because 72 COLREGS was elaborated as a treaty, and under usual treaty practice only parties are bound, there may be a period of time after the 72 COLREGS come into force during which the ships of a nation not party to 72 COLREGS might not be considered as being bound to comply with the convention. While it is most likely that the 72 COLREGS will rapidly achieve the status of customary international law, thereby obviating any concern on the part of the mariner as to whether a particular nation is a party, it does not necessarily follow that the courts in all nations will apply 72 COLREGS to the vessels of a non-party nation. In the absence of changes in their domestic law there may be certain nations that will feel compelled to continue 60 COLREGS in force, despite the coming into force of 72 COLREGS.</P>

            <P>The following nations are Contracting Parties for which 72 COLREGS will apply upon the Convention's entry into force:

            <P>Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of 72 COLREGS without interfering with their special function may instead meet alternative requirements. The Chief of the Prevention Division in each Coast Guard District Office makes this determination and requires that alternative compliance be as close as possible with the 72 COLREGS. These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements in §§ 81.5 and 81.18 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control No. 1625-0019.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application (Rule 1).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) These Rules apply to all vessels upon the inland waters of the United States, and to vessels of the United States on the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes to the extent that there is no conflict with Canadian law. The regulations in this subchapter (subchapter E, 33 CFR parts 83 through 90) have preemptive effect over State or local regulation within the same field.</P>
              <P>(b)(i) These Rules constitute special rules made by an appropriate authority within the meaning of Rule 1(b) of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, including annexes currently in force for the United States (“International Regulations”).</P>
              <P>(ii) All vessels complying with the construction and equipment requirements of the International Regulations are considered to be in compliance with these Rules.</P>

              <P>(c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Secretary of the Navy with respect to additional station or signal lights and shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or by the Secretary with respect to additional station or signal lights and shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights and shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorized elsewhere <PRTPAGE P="204"/>under these Rules. Notice of such special rules shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and, after the effective date specified in such notice, they shall have effect as if they were a part of these Rules.</P>
              <P>(d) Traffic separation schemes may be established for the purpose of these Rules. Vessel traffic service regulations may be in effect in certain areas.</P>
              <P>(e) Whenever the Secretary determines that a vessel or class of vessels of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, the vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, as the Secretary shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules. The Secretary may issue a certificate of alternative compliance for a vessel or class of vessels specifying the closest possible compliance with these Rules. The Secretary of the Navy shall make these determinations and issue certificates of alternative compliance for vessels of the Navy.</P>
              <P>(f) The Secretary may accept a certificate of alternative compliance issued by a contracting party to the International Regulations if it determines that the alternative compliance standards of the contracting party are substantially the same as those of the United States.</P>
              <P>(g) The operator of each self-propelled vessel 12 meters or more in length shall carry, on board and maintain for ready reference, a copy of these Rules.</P>

                <P>(b) Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.</P>
                <P>(c) If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.</P>
                <P>(d) Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.</P>

                <P>(d) A vessel must not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel must use the signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) (§ 83.34(d)) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.</P>
                <P>(e)(i) In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking, the power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c) (§ 83.34(c)) and take steps to permit safe passing. The power-driven vessel being overtaken, if in agreement, shall sound the same signal and may, if specifically agreed to, take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she shall sound the signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) (§ 83.34(d)).</P>

              <P>(a) When power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other, each vessel underway, when maneuvering as authorized or required by these Rules:</P>
              <P>(i) Shall indicate that maneuver by the following signals on her whistle:</P>
              <P>(1) One short blast to mean “I intend to leave you on my port side”;</P>
              <P>(2) Two short blasts to mean “I intend to leave you on my starboard side”; and</P>
              <P>(3) Three short blasts to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon hearing the one or two blast signal of the other shall, if in agreement, sound the same whistle signal and take the steps necessary to effect a safe passing. If, however, from any cause, the vessel doubts the safety of the proposed maneuver, she shall sound the signal specified in paragraph (d) of this Rule and each vessel shall take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passing agreement is made.</P>
              <P>(b) A vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule by light signals:</P>
              <P>(i) These signals shall have the following significance:</P>
              <P>(1) One flash to mean “I intend to leave you on my port side”;</P>

              <P>(iii) The light used for this signal shall, if fitted, be one all-round white or yellow light, visible at a minimum range of 2 miles, synchronized with the whistle, and shall comply with the provisions of Annex I to these Rules (33 CFR part 84).</P>
              <P>(c) When in sight of one another:</P>
              <P>(i) A power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle:</P>
              <P>(1) One short blast to mean “I intend to overtake you on your starboard side”;</P>
              <P>(2) Two short blasts to mean “I intend to overtake you on your port side”; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The power-driven vessel about to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound a similar sound signal. If in <PRTPAGE P="218"/>doubt she shall sound the signal prescribed in paragraph (d) of this Rule.</P>
              <P>(d) When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and, from any cause, either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. Such signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes.</P>
              <P>(e) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. This signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.</P>
              <P>(f) If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, one whistle only shall be used for giving maneuvering and warning signals.</P>
              <P>(g) When a power-driven vessel is leaving a dock or berth, she shall sound one prolonged blast.</P>

              <P>(h) A vessel that reaches agreement with another vessel in a head-on, crossing, or overtaking situation, as for example, by using the radiotelephone as prescribed by the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act (85 Stat. 164; 33 U.S.C. 1201 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), is not obliged to sound the whistle signals prescribed by this Rule, but may do so. If agreement is not reached, then whistle signals shall be exchanged in a timely manner and shall prevail.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Frequencies and range of audibility.</E> The fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 70-700 Hz. The range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the range 180-700 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of 20 meters or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of less than 20 meters in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limits of fundamental frequencies.</E> To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits:</P>
            <P>(i) 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 meters or more in length.</P>
            <P>(ii) 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 meters but less than 200 meters in length.</P>
            <P>(iii) 250-700 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 meters in length.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sound signal intensity and range of audibility.</E> A whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 meter from it, a sound pressure level in at least one <FR>1/3</FR>rd-octave band within the range of frequencies 180-700 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of 20 meters or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of less than 20 meters in length, of not less than the appropriate figure given in Table 86.01(c) of this section. The range of audibility in Table 86.01(c) is the approximate range at which a whistle may be heard on its forward axis with 90% probability in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centered on 250 Hz and 63 dB in the octave band centered on 500 Hz). It is shown for information purposes only. In practice, the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends critically on weather conditions; the values given can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient noise level at the listening post the range may be reduced.<PRTPAGE P="225"/>

              <SUBJECT>What is involved to complete a safety management audit and when is it required to be completed?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A safety management audit is any of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) An initial audit which is carried out before a Document of Compliance certificate or a Safety Management Certificate is issued;</P>
              <P>(2) A renewal audit which is carried out before the renewal of a Document of Compliance certificate or a Safety Management Certificate;</P>
              <P>(3) Periodic audits including—</P>
              <P>(i) An annual verification audit, as described in § 96.330(f) of this part, and</P>
              <P>(ii) An intermediate verification audit, as described in § 96.340(e)(2) of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) A satisfactory audit means that the auditor(s) agrees that the requirements of this part are met, based on review and verification of the procedures and documents that make up the safety management system.</P>
              <P>(c) Actions required during safety management audits for a company and their U.S. vessel(s) are—</P>
              <P>(1) Review and verify the procedures and documents that make up a safety management system, as defined in subpart B of this part.</P>

              <P>(2) Make sure the audit complies with this subpart and is consistent with IMO Resolution A.788(19), Guidelines on Implementation of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code by Administrations.<PRTPAGE P="240"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Make sure the audit is carried out by a team of Coast Guard auditors or auditors assigned by a recognized organization authorized to complete such actions by subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Safety management audits for a company and their U.S. vessel(s) are required—</P>
              <P>(1) Before issuing or renewing a Document of Compliance certificate, and to keep a Document of Compliance certificate valid, as described in §§ 96.330 and 96.340 of this part.</P>

              <P>(2) Before issuing or renewing a Safety Management Certificate, and to maintain the validity of a Safety Management Certificate, as described in § 96.340 of this part.
              </P>
              <FP>However, any safety management audit for the purpose of verifying a vessel's safety management system will not be scheduled or conducted for a company's U.S. vessel unless the company first has undergone a safety management audit of the company's safety management system, and has received its Document of Compliance certificate.</FP>
              <P>(e) Requests for all safety management audits for a company and its U.S. vessel(s) must be communicated—</P>
              <P>(1) By a responsible person directly to a recognized organization authorized by the U.S.</P>
              <P>(2) By a responsible person within the time limits for an annual verification audit, described in § 96.330(f) of this part, and for an intermediate verification audit, described in § 96.340(e)(2) of this part. If he or she does not make a request for a safety management annual or verification audit for a valid Document of Compliance certificate issued to a company or a valid Safety Management Certificate issued to a vessel, this is cause for the Coast Guard to revoke the certificate as described in §§ 96.330 and 96.340 of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) If a non-conformity with a safety management system is found during an audit, it must be reported in writing by the auditor:</P>
              <P>(1) For a company's safety management system audit, to the company's owner; and</P>
              <P>(2) For a vessel's safety management system audit, to the company's owner and vessel's Master.</P>

              <P>This section applies to the marine events listed in Table 1 of this section. The regulations in this section will be enforced for the duration of each event, on or about the dates indicated in Table 1 of this section. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the effective period of the regulations in this section with respect to each event, the geographical description of each regulated area, and details concerning the nature of the event and the number of participants and type(s) of vessels involved will be provided to the local maritime community through the Local Notice to Mariners and/or Broadcast Notice to Mariners well in advance of the events. If the event does not have a date listed, then the exact dates and times of the enforcement will be announced through a Notice of Enforcement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Mariners should consult the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or their LNM to remain apprised of minor schedule or event changes. First Coast Guard District LNM can be found at: <E T="03">http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/.</E> The Sector Boston Marine Events schedule can also be viewed electronically at <E T="03">http://www.homeport.uscg.mil.</E> Although listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, sponsors of events listed in Table 1 of this section are still required to submit a marine event permit application in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.</P>
              <P>(a) The Coast Guard may patrol each event area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander (PATCOM).

              <SUBJECT>Great Lakes annual marine events.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Permanent special local regulations are hereby established for the marine events listed in Table 1. These regulations will be effective annually, for the duration of each event, on or about the dates indicated in Table 1. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the effective period of the regulations with respect to each event, the geographical description of each regulated area, and details concerning the nature of the event and the number of participants and type(s) of vessels involved will be published in local notices to mariners. To be placed on the mailing list for such notices, contact: Commander(oan), Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 E. Ninth St., Cleveland, OH 44199-2060. <E T="03">Sponsors of events listed in Table 1 must still submit an application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(a) The Coast Guard will patrol the regatta area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The Patrol Commander may be contacted on Channel 16 (156.8 MHZ) by the call sign “Coast Guard Patrol Commander.” Vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander and when so directed by that officer. Vessels will be operated at a no wake speed to reduce the wake to a minimum, and in a manner which will not endanger participants in the event or any other craft. The rules contained in the above two sentences shall not apply to participants in the event or vessels of the patrol operating in the performance of their assigned duties.</P>
              <P>(b) The Patrol Commander may direct the anchoring, mooring, or movement of any boat or vessel within the regatta area. A succession of sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the area under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander shall serve as a signal to stop. Vessels so signaled shall stop and shall comply with the orders of the Patrol Commander. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.</P>
              <P>(c) The Patrol Commander may establish vessel size and speed limitations and operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(d) The Patrol Commander may restrict vessel operation within the regatta area to vessels having particular operating characteristics.</P>
              <P>(e) The Patrol Commander may terminate the marine event or the operation of any vessel at any time it is deemed necessary for the protection of life and property.</P>
              <P>(f) Patrol Commander means a Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer who has been designated by the Captain of the Port to monitor a regatta area, permit entry into the regatta area, give legally enforceable orders to persons or vessels within the regatta area, and take other actions authorized by the Captain of the Port.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Special local regulations are established for the events listed in Table 1 of this section. Notice of implementation of these special local regulations will be made by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> 30 days prior to the event for those events without specific dates or by Notice to Mariners 20 Days prior to the event for those events listing a period for which a firm date is identifiable. In all cases, further information on exact dates, times, and other details concerning the number and type of participants and an exact geographical description of the areas are published by the Eleventh Coast Guard District in the Local Notice to Mariners at least 20 days prior to each event. Local Notices to Mariners are available for viewing on the Coast Guard Navigation Center Web site at <E T="03">http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=lnmDistrict&amp;region=11</E>. <E T="04">Note:</E> Sponsors of events listed in Table 1 of this section must submit an application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15 to the cognizant Coast Guard Sector Commander no less than 60 days before the start of the proposed event. Sponsors are informed that ample lead time is required to inform all Federal, state, local agencies, and/or other interested parties and to provide the sponsor the best support to ensure the safety of life and property.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Special local regulations.</E> All persons and vessels not registered with the sponsor as participants or as official patrol vessels are considered spectators. The “official patrol” consists of any Coast Guard; other Federal, state, or local law enforcement; and any public or sponsor-provided vessels assigned or approved by the cognizant Coast Guard Sector Commander to patrol each event.</P>
              <P>(1) No spectator shall anchor, block, loiter, nor impede the through transit of participants or official patrol vessels in the regulated areas during all applicable effective dates and times unless cleared to do so by or through an official patrol vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) When hailed and/or signaled by an official patrol vessel, any spectator located within a regulated area during all applicable effective dates and times shall come to an immediate stop.</P>

              <P>(3) The Patrol Commander (PATCOM) is empowered to control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area or to restrict vessels from entering the regulated area. The Patrol Commander shall be designated by the cognizant Coast Guard Sector Commander; will be a U.S. Coast Guard commissioned officer, warrant officer, or petty officer to act as the Sector Commander's official representative; and will be located aboard the lead official patrol vessel. As the Sector Commander's representative, the PATCOM may terminate the event any time it is deemed necessary for the protection of life and property. PATCOM may be reached on VHF-FM Channel 13 (156.65MHz) or 16 (156.8MHz) when required, by the call sign “PATCOM.”<PRTPAGE P="334"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The Patrol Commander may, upon request, allow the transit of commercial vessels through regulated areas when it is safe to do so.</P>
              <P>(5) The Coast Guard may be assisted by other Federal, state, or local agencies.</P>

              <P>(a) This section will only be enforced during times announced by the Captain of the Port. The event, which is one week or less in duration, generally occurs during the last week of July or the first two weeks of August. The Captain of the Port will provide notice of the enforcement of this special local regulation by Notice of Enforcement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Additional information may be available through Broadcast Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners.</P>
              <P>(b) The area where the Coast Guard will restrict general navigation by this regulation during the hours it is in effect is: The waters of Lake Washington bounded by the Interstate 90 (Mercer Island /Lacey V. Murrow) Bridge, the western shore of Lake Washington, and the east/west line drawn tangent to Bailey Peninsula and along the shoreline of Mercer Island.</P>
              <P>(c) The area described in paragraph (b) of this section has been divided into two zones. The zones are separated by a line perpendicular from the I-90 Bridge to the northwest corner of the East log boom and a line extending from the southeast corner of the East log boom to the southeast corner of the hydroplane race course and then to the northerly tip of Ohlers Island in Andrews Bay. The western zone is designated Zone I, the eastern zone, Zone II. (Refer to NOAA Chart 18447).</P>
              <P>(d) The Coast Guard will maintain a patrol consisting of Coast Guard vessels, assisted by Auxiliary Coast Guard vessels, in Zone II. The Coast Guard patrol of this area is under the direction of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander (the “Patrol Commander”). The Patrol Commander is empowered to control the movement of vessels on the racecourse and in the adjoining waters during the periods this regulation is in effect. The Patrol Commander may be assisted by other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.</P>
              <P>(e) Only authorized vessels may be allowed to enter Zone I during the hours this regulation is in effect. Vessels in the vicinity of Zone I shall maneuver and anchor as directed by Coast Guard Officers or Petty Officers.</P>
              <P>(f) During the times in which the regulation is in effect, swimming, wading, or otherwise entering the water in Zone I by any person is prohibited while hydroplane boats are on the racecourse. At other times in Zone I, any person entering the water from the shoreline shall remain west of the swim line, denoted by buoys, and any person entering the water from the log boom shall remain within ten (10) feet of the log boom.</P>

              <P>(g) During the times in which the regulation is in effect, any person swimming or otherwise entering the <PRTPAGE P="339"/>water in Zone II shall remain within ten (10) feet of a vessel.</P>
              <P>(h) During the times this regulation is in effect, rafting to a log boom will be limited to groups of three vessels.</P>
              <P>(i) During the times this regulation is in effect, up to six (6) vessels may raft together in Zone II if none of the vessels are secured to a log boom.</P>
              <P>(j) During the times this regulation is in effect, only vessels authorized by the Patrol Commander, other law enforcement agencies or event sponsors shall be permitted to tow other watercraft or inflatable devices.</P>
              <P>(k) Vessels proceeding in either Zone I or Zone II during the hours this regulation is in effect shall do so only at speeds which will create minimum wake, seven (07) miles per hour or less. This maximum speed may be reduced at the discretion of the Patrol Commander.</P>
              <P>(l) Upon completion of the daily racing activities, all vessels leaving either Zone I or Zone II shall proceed at speeds of seven (07) miles per hour or less. The maximum speed may be reduced at the discretion of the Patrol Commander.</P>
              <P>(m) A succession of sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the areas under the direction of the Patrol Commander shall serve as signal to stop. Vessels signaled shall stop and shall comply with the orders of the patrol vessel; failure to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both. The Coast Guard may be assisted by other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as official Seafair event craft.</P>

              <P>This section applies to the marine events listed in Table 1 of this section. The regulations in this section will be enforced for the duration of each event, on or about the dates indicated in Table 1 of this section. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the effective period of the regulations in this section with respect to each event, the geographical description of each regulated area, and details concerning the nature of the event and the number of participants and type(s) of vessels involved will be provided to the local maritime community through the Local Notice to Mariners, Broadcast Notice to Mariners, or both, well in advance of the events. If the event does not have a date listed, then the exact dates and times of the enforcement will be announced through a Notice of Enforcement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Mariners should consult the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or their LNM to remain apprised of minor schedule or event changes. Thirteenth Coast Guard District LNM can be found at: <E T="03">http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/.</E> The application requirements of § 100.15 apply to all marine events listed in the Table of this section.</P>
              <P>(a) The Coast Guard may patrol each event area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander (PATCOM). PATCOM may be contacted on Channel 16 VHF-FM (156.8 MHz) by the call sign “PATCOM.” Official patrol vessels may consist of any Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessels assigned or approved by the Captain of the Port, Sector Columbia River.</P>
              <P>(b) PATCOM may control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area. When hailed or signaled by an official patrol vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the lawful directions issued. Failure to comply with a lawful direction may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.</P>
              <P>(c) PATCOM may delay or terminate any marine event in this subpart at any time it is deemed necessary to ensure the safety of life or property. Such action may be justified as a result of weather, traffic density, spectator operation or participant behavior.</P>
              <P>(d) Vessels may not transit the regulated areas without PATCOM approval. Vessels permitted to transit must operate at a no wake speed, in a manner which will not endanger participants or other crafts in the event.</P>

              <P>(e) Spectators or other vessels shall not anchor, block, loiter, or impede the transit of event participants or official patrol vessels in the regulated areas <PRTPAGE P="340"/>during the effective dates and times, or dates and times as modified through LNM, unless authorized by an official patrol vessel.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Location.</E> The following regulated area is established as a special local regulation: Breakers Point (eastern edge of Pago Pago Harbor entrance) thence southeast to 14°18′47″ S., 170°38′54.5″ W. thence southwest to 14°19′03″ S., 170° 39′14″ W., thence northwest to Tulutulu Point and then following the coastline encompassing Pago Pago Harbor. This regulated area extends from the surface of the water to the ocean floor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective period.</E> These annual events occur on four separate dates to include: April 17; and three days to include Friday, Saturday or a holiday weekday, in November between the week of Veteran's Day and the Thanksgiving weekend, lasting between 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. The Captain of the Port Honolulu will establish specific enforcement dates that will be announced in advance by Notice of Enforcement, Local Notice to Mariners, Broadcast Notice to Mariners, and prior event outreach, including local advertisement and on-scene designated <PRTPAGE P="344"/>representatives prior to and during the event.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Regulations.</E> (1) All persons and vessels not registered with the sponsor as participants or support/enforcement vessels are considered spectators.

              <P>(a) The purpose of this subchapter is:</P>
              <P>(1) To implement portions of the maritime security regime required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, as codified in 46 U.S.C. Chapter 701;</P>
              <P>(2) To align, where appropriate, the requirements of domestic maritime security regulations with the international maritime security standards in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS Chapter XI-2) and the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities, parts A and B, adopted on 12 December 2002; and</P>
              <P>(3) To ensure security arrangements are as compatible as possible for vessels trading internationally.</P>
              <P>(b) For those maritime elements of the national transportation system where international standards do not directly apply, the requirements in this subchapter emphasize cooperation and coordination with local port community stakeholders, and are based on existing domestic standards, as well as established industry security practices.</P>
              <P>(c) The assessments and plans required by this subchapter are intended for use in implementing security measures at various MARSEC Levels. The specific security measures and their implementation are planning criteria based on a set of assumptions made during the development of the security assessment and plan. These assumptions may not exist during an actual transportation security incident.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Maritime Security (MARSEC) Directives.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) When the Coast Guard determines that additional security measures are necessary to respond to a threat assessment or to a specific threat against the maritime elements of the national transportation system, the Coast Guard may issue a MARSEC Directive setting forth mandatory measures. Only the Commandant or his/her delegee may issue MARSEC Directives under this section. Prior to issuing a MARSEC Directive, the Commandant or his/her delegee will consult with those Federal agencies having an interest in the subject matter of that MARSEC Directive. All MARSEC Directives issued under this section shall be marked as sensitive security information (SSI) in accordance with 49 CFR part 1520.</P>

              <P>(2) When a MARSEC Directive is issued, the Coast Guard will immediately publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and affected owners and operators will need to go to their local COTP or cognizant District Commander to acquire a copy of the MARSEC Directive. COTPs and District Commanders will require owners or operators to prove that they are a person required by 49 CFR 1520.5(a) to restrict disclosure of and access to sensitive security information, and that under 49 CFR 1520.5(b), they have a need to know sensitive security information.</P>
              <P>(b) Each owner or operator of a vessel or facility to whom a MARSEC Directive applies is required to comply with the relevant instructions contained in a MARSEC Directive issued under this section within the time prescribed by that MARSEC Directive.</P>
              <P>(c) Each owner or operator of a vessel or facility required to have a security plan under parts 104, 105 or 106 of this subchapter that receives a MARSEC Directive must:</P>
              <P>(1) Within the time prescribed in the MARSEC Directive, acknowledge receipt of the MARSEC Directive to their local COTP or, if a facility regulated under part 106 of this subchapter, to their cognizant District Commander; and</P>

              <P>(2) Within the time prescribed in the MARSEC Directive, specify the method <PRTPAGE P="357"/>by which the measures in the MARSEC Directive have been implemented (or will be implemented, if the MARSEC Directive is not yet effective).</P>
              <P>(d) In the event that the owner or operator of a vessel or facility required to have a security plan under part 104, 105, or 106 of this subchapter is unable to implement the measures in the MARSEC Directive, the owner or operator must submit proposed equivalent security measures and the basis for submitting the equivalent security measures to the COTP or, if a facility regulated under part 106 of this subchapter, to their cognizant District Commander, for approval.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator must submit the proposed equivalent security measures within the time prescribed in the MARSEC Directive.

              <P>(1) Vessels of the United States less than 100 meters (328 feet) in length (and all associated auxiliary vessels) and the owners, agents, masters, officers, persons in charge, and members of the crew of such vessels, that depart U.S. territorial waters and thereafter enter Cuban territorial waters, regardless of whether such entry is made after an intervening entry into, passage through, or departure from any other foreign territory or territorial waters;</P>
              <P>(2) Vessels of the United States less than 100 meters (328 feet) in length (and all associated auxiliary vessels) and the owners, agents, masters, officers, persons in charge, and members of the crew of such vessels that are located at or get underway from a berth, pier, mooring, or anchorage in U.S. territorial waters, or depart U.S. territorial waters with the intent to enter Cuban territorial waters; and</P>
              <P>(3) Any person who knowingly fails to comply with this subpart or order given under this subpart, or knowingly obstructs or interferes with the exercise of any power conferred by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart does not apply to: Foreign vessels, as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(12), public vessels, as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(24) operated for non-commercial purposes, or vessels of the United States entering Cuban territorial waters under force majeure.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regulations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each person or vessel to which this subpart applies may not get underway or depart from U.S. territorial waters without a written permit from the Commander, Seventh Coast Guard District, or the District Commander's designee. Permits may be obtained pursuant to the process established in § 107.220. The owner, agent, master, or person in charge of the vessel must maintain the written permit for the vessel on board the vessel.</P>
              <P>(b) Each person or vessel to which this subpart applies must obey any oral or written order issued by a Coast Guard Area or District Commander, or their designees, who may issue oral or written orders to control the anchorage or movement of such vessels and persons. Designees include Captains of the Port, and commissioned, warrant and petty officers of the Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(c) No person or vessel to which this subpart applies may obstruct or interfere with the exercise of any power conferred by this subpart.</P>

              <P>(d) Coast Guard commissioned, warrant and petty officers may go or remain on board a vessel subject to this subpart, may place guards on the subject vessel, may remove all persons not specifically authorized by the Coast Guard to go or remain on board the subject vessel, and may take full or partial possession or control of any such vessel or part thereof, or person on board. Such actions to be taken are in the discretion of the Coast Guard Area or District Commander, or their <PRTPAGE P="444"/>designees, as deemed necessary to ensure compliance with this subpart and any order given pursuant thereto.</P>
              <P>(e) Where there is a reasonable, articulable basis to believe a vessel to which this subpart applies intends to enter Cuban territorial waters, any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer may require the owners, agents, masters, officers, or persons in charge, or any member of the crew of any such vessel to provide verbal assurance that the vessel will not enter Cuban territorial waters as a condition for a vessel to get underway from a berth, pier, mooring, or anchorage in U.S. territorial waters, or to depart from U.S. territorial waters. A Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer may require the owners, agents, masters, officers, or persons in charge of the vessel to identify all persons on board the vessel and provide verbal assurances that all persons on board have received actual notice of these regulations. The failure of an owner, agent, master, officer, or person in charge, or any member of the crew of any vessel (including all auxiliary vessels) to which this subpart applies to provide requested verbal assurances shall not be used as the sole basis for seizing the vessel for forfeiture under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) The provisions of this subpart are in addition to any powers conferred by law upon Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officers, and not in limitation of any powers conferred by law or regulation upon such officers, or any other officers of the United States.</P>

            <P>(a) Section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 4, 1915 (33 U.S.C. 471), authorizes the establishment of anchorage grounds for vessels in navigable waters of the United States whenever it is apparent that these are required by the maritime or commercial interests of the United States for safe navigation. The statute also authorizes the adoption of suitable rules and regulations regarding the establishment of anchorage grounds, which are enforced by the Coast Guard. The authority conferred by this statute was transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 902(j) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-241, 120 Stat. 516), and delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1. The Commandant redelegated the authority to establish anchorage grounds to each Coast Guard District Commander as provided in 33 CFR 1.05-1(e)(1)(i).</P>
            <P>(b) District Commanders will, whenever matters relating to the anchorage of vessels are under consideration, ascertain the view of the District and Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, and the proper representatives of other departments likely to be interested, including the Commandant of the Naval District concerned and the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station at localities where quarantine anchorages are involved, in order that they may arrange for suitable representation at such hearings. The views of the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station relating to the proposed location and boundaries of the quarantine anchorage will be accepted insofar as practicable and consistent with the establishment of other anchorage areas. (An Act of Congress approved July 1, 1944, as amended (42 U.S.C. 267), authorizes the Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to designate the boundaries of the quarantine grounds and quarantine anchorages for vessels which are reserved for use at each United States quarantine station.) A notice of public hearing concerning changes to the Anchorage Regulations will be issued by the District Commander and will be mailed to all known interested parties. After providing an opportunity for public participation, the District Commander will, if circumstances so warrant, issue changes to the Anchorage Regulations, or in appropriate cases forward recommendations for such changes to the Commandant.</P>
            <P>(c) As soon as publication has been noted in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the District Commander will publish changes to the Anchorage Regulations in the Local Notice to Mariners.</P>

            <P>An Act of Congress of April 22, 1940, provides for the designation of special anchorage areas wherein vessels not more than sixty-five feet in length, when at anchor, will not be required to carry or exhibit anchorage lights. Such designation is to be made after investigation, by rule, regulation, or order, the procedure for which will be similar to that followed for anchorage grounds under section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 4, 1915, as referred to in § 109.05. The areas so designated should be well removed from the fairways and located where general navigation will not endanger or be endangered by unlighted vessels. The authority to designate special anchorage areas was transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 902(j) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-241, 120 Stat 516), and delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1.

Except where notice or hearing is required by statute, this requirement does not apply to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice, or in any situation in which the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of the reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.</P>

              <P>(4) A vessel upon being notified to move into the anchorage limits or to shift its position on anchorage grounds must get under way at once or signal for a tug, and must change position as directed with reasonable promptness.</P>
              <P>(5) Whenever the maritime or commercial interests of the United States so require, any officer of the Coast Guard is hereby empowered to shift the position of any vessel anchored within the anchorage areas, of any vessel anchored outside the anchorage areas, and of any vessel which is so moored or anchored as to impede or obstruct vessel movements in any channel.</P>

              <P>(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties of the law for obstructing <PRTPAGE P="496"/>navigation or for obstructing or interfering with range lights, or for not complying with the navigation laws in regard to lights, fog signals, or for otherwise violating the law.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">General regulations.</E>(1) These anchorages are designated for general purposes, but are intended primarily for use by commercial vessels of 300 gross tons and greater and all tank vessels including tank barges. Except in emergencies, commercial vessels of 300 gross tons and greater and all tank vessels, including tank barges, anchoring in the Captain of the Port Long Island Sound Zone inside the line of demarcation shall anchor in the anchorage grounds described above.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to anchoring in the anchorage area, all vessels shall notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port via VHF-FM Channel 16.</P>

              <P>(3) In anchorages where lightering and bunkering operations are authorized, the Captain of the Port must be <PRTPAGE P="497"/>notified at least four hours in advance of a vessel conducting lightering or bunkering operations, as required by 156.118 of this title. In addition, all lightering and bunkering operations must be done in accordance with 156.120 of this title.</P>
              <P>(4) Within an anchorage, navigation is prohibited within 500 yards of an anchored vessel that is conducting bunkering or lightering operations. In accordance with the “Regulated Navigation Area: Long Island Sound Marine Inspection and Captain of the Port Zone,” 33 CFR 165.153(d)(7), navigation also is prohibited within 100 yards of a vessel engaged in commercial service.</P>
              <P>(5) Any vessel conducting lightering or bunkering operations shall display by day a red flag at its mast head or at least 10 feet above the upper deck if the vessel has no mast, and by night the flag must be illuminated by spotlight. These signals shall be in addition to day signals, lights, and whistle signals required by rules 30 (33 U.S.C. 2030) and 35 (33 U.S.C. 2035) of the Inland Navigation Rules when at anchor in a general anchorage area.</P>
              <P>(6) Except as otherwise provided, a vessel may not occupy an anchorage for more than 30 days, unless the vessel obtains written permission from the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(7) If a request is made for the long-term lay up of a vessel, the Captain of the Port may establish special conditions with which the vessel must comply in order for such a request to be approved.</P>
              <P>(8) The Captain of the Port may prescribe specific conditions for vessels anchoring within the anchorage grounds described in this section, pursuant to 33 CFR 109.05. These conditions may include, but are not limited to: The number and location of anchors; scope of chain; readiness of the engineering plant and equipment; use of tugs; and requirements for maintaining communication guards on selected radio frequencies.</P>
              <P>(9) No vessel in such condition that it is likely to sink or otherwise become a menace or obstruction to navigation or anchorage of other vessels shall occupy an anchorage, except in cases where unforeseen circumstances create conditions of imminent peril to personnel, and then only for such period as may be authorized by the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(10) All vessels anchored within the designated anchorage grounds shall comply with the regulations found in 33 CFR 164.19 and shall maintain a continuous bridge watch by a licensed deck officer proficient in English, monitoring VHF-FM Channel 16. This individual shall confirm that the ship's crew performs frequent checks of the vessel's position to ensure the vessel is not dragging anchor. A second VHF-FM radio monitoring Channel 13 is strongly recommended.</P>
              <P>(11) Anchors shall be placed well within the anchorage grounds so that no portion of the hull or rigging will at any time extend outside of the anchorage area.</P>
              <P>(12) The Coast Guard Captain of the Port may close the anchorage area and direct vessels to depart the anchorage during periods of adverse weather or at other times as deemed necessary in the interest of port safety and security.</P>
              <P>(13) Any vessel anchored in these grounds must be capable of getting underway if ordered by the Captain of the Port and must be able to do so within two (2) hours of notification by the Captain of the Port. If a vessel will not be able to get underway within two (2) hours of notification, permission must be requested from the Captain of the Port to remain in the anchorage. No vessel shall anchor in a “dead ship” status (propulsion or control unavailable for normal operations) without prior approval of the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(14) Fixed moorings, piles or stakes are prohibited.</P>

When an emergent condition exists due to congestion in the prescribed anchorage areas in the Delaware River, the Captain of the Port may authorize the anchorage of vessels in locations other than the prescribed areas. Vessels so anchored must not be anchored within the channel limits. Any vessel anchored outside of the prescribed anchorage limits must move to a prescribed anchorage area when space becomes available.</P>
              <P>(2) No vessel shall occupy any prescribed anchorage for a longer period than 48 hours without a permit from the Captain of the Port. Vessels expecting to be at anchor for more than 48 hours shall obtain a permit from the Captain of the Port for that purpose. No vessel in such condition that it is likely to sink or otherwise become a menace or obstruction to navigation or anchorage of other vessels shall occupy an anchorage except in an emergency, and then only for such period as may be permitted by the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(3) Whenever, in the opinion of the Captain of the Port such action may be necessary, he may require any or all vessels in any designated anchorage area to moor with two or more anchors.</P>
              <P>(4) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(5) Anchors shall be placed well within the anchorage areas, so that no portion of the hull or rigging will at any time extend outside of the anchorage area.</P>

              <P>(7) Upon approval of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, the Captain of the Port may permit wrecking plant or other vessels legally engaged in recovering sunken property, or in laying or repairing pipe lines or cables, or plant engaged in dredging operations, to anchor in channels. Such permission is not necessary for plant engaged upon works of river and harbor improvement under the supervision of the District Engineer, but the District Engineer will notify the Captain of the Port in advance of all such proposed work.</P>

Permission to anchor will be granted on a “first-come, first-served” basis. The Captain of the Port, Philadelphia, will allow only one vessel at a time to be at anchor in Anchorage 7, and no vessel may remain within Anchorage 7 for more than 12 hours. Any vessel arriving from or departing to sea that requires an examination by the public health service, customs or immigration authorities will be directed to an anchorage for the required inspection by <PRTPAGE P="511"/>the Captain of the Port on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(ii) For Anchorage 6 off Deepwater Point, as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, and Anchorage 9 as described in paragraph (a)(10) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Any vessel 700 feet or greater in length requesting anchorage shall obtain permission from the Captain of the Port, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at least 24 hours in advance.</P>

              <P>(D) The Master, owner or operator of a vessel at anchor shall ensure that any tug required by this section is of sufficient horsepower to assist with necessary maneuvers to keep the vessel clear of the navigation channel.</P>
              <P>(iii) As used in this section, Captain of the Port means the Commander of Sector Delaware Bay or any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer who has been authorized by the Captain of the Port to act on his behalf. The Captain of the Port may be contacted by telephone at (215) 271-4807 or via VHF marine band radio, channel 16.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Regulations for vessels carrying and handling explosives.</E> (1) All vessels carrying explosives as defined in and subject to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 171 through 177, or on which such explosives are to be loaded, shall obtain a permit from the Captain of the Port, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The maximum amount of explosives for which a permit is required in 49 CFR Parts 171 through 177, which may be carried or loaded at any time by a vessel shall not exceed 800 tons, except in cases of great emergency or by special permit from the Captain of the Port. This written permit shall be obtained from the Captain of the Port before vessels carrying explosives or on which explosives are to be loaded within the weight limit specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may anchor in any anchorge. Permits will not be issued for Anchorage 2 under any circumstances. Such permit may be revoked at any time. All vessels used in connection with loading, or unloading explosives shall carry written permits from the Captain of the Port, and shall show such permit whenever required by him or his representative.</P>
              <P>(2) Vessels handling explosives shall be anchored so as to be at least 2,200 feet from any other vessel, but the number of vessels which may anchor in an anchorage at any one time shall be at the discretion of the Captain of the Port. This provision is not intended to prohibit barges or lighters from tying up alongside the vessels for the transfer of cargo.</P>
              <P>(3) Whenever a vessel or barge not mechanically self-propelled anchors while carrying explosives or while awaiting the loading of explosives, the Captain of the Port may require the attendance of a tug upon such vessel or barge when in his judgment such action is necessary.</P>
              <P>(4) Fishing and navigation are prohibited within an anchorage whenever occupied by an anchored vessel displaying a red flag.</P>
              <P>(5) The District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may authorize, in writing, a vessel carrying explosives for use on river and harbor works or on other work under Department of the Army permit, to anchor in or near the vicinity of such work. The Captain of the Port will prescribe the conditions under which explosives shall be stored and handled in such cases.</P>
              <P>(6) Vessels carrying explosives or on which explosives are to be loaded, within the weight limit specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall comply with the general regulations in paragraph (b) of this section when applicable.</P>
              <P>(7) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any vessel or the owner or person-in-charge of any vessel, and all others concerned, of the duties and responsibilities imposed upon them to comply with the regulations governing the handling, loading or discharging of explosives entitled “Subchapter C—Hazardous Materials Regulations” (49 CFR Parts 171 through 177).</P>

Vessels must be anchored in such a way as not to interfere with the free navigation of channels in the port, including Cooper, Ashley, Wando Rivers, and Town Creek, nor to obstruct the approach to any pier or entrance to any slip, nor to impede the movement of any vessel or craft.</P>
              <P>(2) Vessels using the anchorages opposite the eastern waterfront of Charleston shall place their anchors as near as possible in the center of the anchorage. Vessels not using a designated commercial anchorage shall not place their anchors within the main ship channels, nor shall be so anchored as to swing within 400 feet of any wharf or pier on the eastern waterfront of Charleston. Vessels may be so anchored as to swing into the main ship channels only if they are so placed with reference to the customary winds, tides, and currents of the harbor, as to swing only during slack water, and that during this period there shall remain in the waters adjacent to the channel an area of sufficient depth as to permit the safe passage of loaded vessels.</P>
              <P>(3) No vessel may anchor within the designated anchorages for more than 72 hours without the prior approval of the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(4) No vessel may anchor unless it maintains a bridge watch, guards and answers Channel 16 FM, and maintains an accurate position plot.</P>
              <P>(5) If any anchored vessel is so close to another that a collision is probable, each vessel must communicate with the other vessel and the Captain of the Port on Channel 16 FM and shall act to eliminate the close proximity situation.</P>
              <P>(6) No vessel may anchor unless it maintains the capability to get underway within 4 hours.</P>
              <P>(7) No vessel may anchor in a “dead ship” status (propulsion or control unavailable for normal operations) without the prior approval of the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(8) Dragging of anchors in or across main ship channels and cable areas is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(9) Vessels which, through force of great emergency, are anchored contrary to the foregoing regulations in this section shall be shifted to new berths in accordance with such regulations at the earliest opportunity.</P>
              <P>(10) A vessel, upon notification from the Captain of the Port to shift its position in anchorage grounds must get underway at once or signal for a tug, and must change position as directed with reasonable promptness.</P>
              <P>(11) No vessel may conduct lightering operations in an anchorage without permission from the Captain of the Port.</P>

All anchorages outside (seaward) of the federal breakwater will be assigned by the Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service (VTIS). The master, pilot, or person in charge of a vessel must notify the appropriate pilot station (for anchorages inside the federal breakwater) or the VTIS (for anchorages outside the federal breakwater) of their intention to anchor, upon anchoring, and at least fifteen minutes prior to departing an anchorage. All anchorage assignments will be made as described in this part unless modified by the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(ii) Radio communications for port entities governing anchorages are as follows: Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service, call sign “LA-Long Beach Traffic,” Channel 14 VHF-FM; Los Angeles Port Pilots, Channel 73 VHF-FM; Long Beach Port Pilots, Channel 74 VHF-FM.</P>
              <P>(iii) The exact boundary separating the Port of Long Beach from the Port of Los Angeles is published in local Port Tariffs. For purposes of this rule, Long Beach waters are those east, and Los Angeles waters are those west, of the following locations:</P>
              <P>(A) Inner Harbor: The Henry Ford (Badger Avenue) Bridge.</P>
              <P>(B) Middle Harbor: The Pier 400 Transportation Corridor.</P>

              <P>(B) No vessel may anchor anywhere else within Los Angeles or Long Beach harbors for more than 10 consecutive days unless extended anchorage permission is obtained from the Captain of the Port. In determining whether extended anchorage permission will be granted, consideration will be given, but not necessarily limited to: The current and anticipated demands for anchorage space within the harbor, the requested duration, the condition of the vessel, and the reason for the request.</P>
              <P>(ii) No vessel while carrying, loading, or unloading division 1.1 or 1.2 materials as defined in 49 CFR 173.50, or Cargoes of Particular Hazard (COPH) as defined in 33 CFR 126.10, or Certain Dangerous Cargoes (CDC) as defined in 33 CFR 160.202, may anchor without first obtaining a permit issued by the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(iii) Vessels requiring use of an explosives anchorage should contact the Captain of the Port at least 24 hours prior to the anticipated need for the explosives anchorage to allow for proper activation of that anchorage.</P>
              <P>(iv) Except with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, or, in the case of an emergency, with approval of the Captain of the Port immediately subsequent to anchoring, no commercial vessel greater than 1600 gross tons may anchor in Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor unless it maintains the capability to get underway within 30 minutes. Any vessel unable to meet this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of the Port and make arrangements for an adequate number of tugs to respond to the vessel within 30 minutes notice.</P>
              <P>(v) In anchorages where lightering is authorized, the Captain of the Port must be notified at least 4 hours in advance of a vessel conducting lightering operations (see 33 CFR 156.118).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other General Requirements.</E> (i) When at anchor, all commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall, at all times, have a licensed or credentialed deck officer on watch and maintain a continuous radio listening watch unless subject to one of the exemptions in this paragraph. The radio watch must be on CH-13 VHF-FM when anchored inside the federal breakwater, and on CH-14 VHF-FM or on CH-16 VHF-FM when anchored outside the federal breakwater, except for unmanned barges; vessels which have less than 100 gallons of oil or fuel onboard regardless of how the fuel is carried; and other vessels receiving advance approval from the Captain of the Port.</P>
              <P>(ii) When sustained wind speeds exceed 40 knots, all anchored commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall ensure their propulsion plant is placed in immediate standby and a second anchor is made ready to let go. Vessels unable to comply with this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of the Port. In such case, the Captain of the Port may require the vessel to have one or more tugs standing by to render immediate assistance.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Prohibitions.</E> Within Los Angeles Harbor, Long Beach Harbor, and the Los Angeles-Long Beach Precautionary Area, except for emergency reasons, or with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, vessels are prohibited from anchoring outside of designated anchorage areas. In the event a vessel anchors outside a designated anchorage area for emergency reasons, the master, pilot, or person in charge of the vessel shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Position the vessel so as to minimize the danger to other vessels and facilities;</P>
              <P>(ii) Immediately notify the Captain of the Port by the most expeditious means of the vessel's location and the reason(s) for the emergency anchoring; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Move the vessel as soon as the emergency condition prompting anchoring outside a designated area abates, or as soon as ordered to move by the Captain of the Port, whichever occurs sooner.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Exemption from rules.</E> The Captain of the Port may, upon request, or whenever he/she deems appropriate, authorize a deviation from any rule in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The anchorage grounds.</E> Locations of anchorage grounds are as described in this section. Specific requirements for individual anchorages are contained in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. All coordinates referenced use datum: NAD 83.<PRTPAGE P="538"/>

            <SUBJECT>General policies on issuance of permits and drawbridge operation regulations.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The several bridge laws referenced in the Authority for part 114, are intended to prevent any interference with navigable waters of the United States whether by bridges, dams, dikes or other obstructions to navigation except by express permission of the United States. The decision as to whether a bridge permit or a drawbridge operation regulation will be <PRTPAGE P="561"/>issued or promulgated must rest primarily upon the effect of the proposed action on navigation to assure that the action provides for the reasonable needs of navigation after full consideration of the effect of the proposed action on the human environment. The Coast Guard is not responsible for any other permits that the applicant may need from other federal, state, or local agencies and issuance of a bridge permit does not affect flood control projects or other governmental programs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Necessary primary authority.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For bridges constructed by State or municipal agencies, the primary authority will be presumed without proof. If the law of the State requires a license for or approval of the bridge from a constituted State agency, a copy of such license or approval will be required and may be accepted as evidence of the primary authority. If there is no State regulation of bridges in navigable waters, the necessary primary authority may be that granted in the charter of a corporation, or the authority inherent in the ownership of the land on which the structure is placed. The applicant will in such cases be required to furnish an excerpt from the charter, or a statement of ownership. Special care will be taken that Federal approval is not granted when there is doubt of the right of the applicant to construct and utilize the bridge.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application for bridge permits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> An application for authorization to construct a bridge across navigable waters of the United States must include the name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; the waterway and location of the bridge; a citation to the applicable act of Congress; when appropriate, a citation to the State legislation authorizing the bridge; a map of the location and plans of the bridge showing the features which affect navigation; and papers to establish the identity of the applicant.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prior authority necessary.</E> Except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, a bridge cannot lawfully be constructed across any navigable waterway of the United States until the location and plans have been approved by the Coast Guard.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prior authority not necessary.</E> Coast Guard approval of the location and plans for construction or modification of a bridge or causeway is not required for any bridge or causeway over waters which are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and which are not used and are not susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce, whether or not such waters were used or were susceptible to use, at some previous time, to transport commerce (historic use). This provision does not apply to bridges which connect the United States with any foreign country.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Signature.</E> In case of signature by an agent or by an official of a corporation, a duly authenticated copy of the authority for the action must accompany the application.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Identification.</E> If the applicant is a corporation, it must furnish certified copies of the following papers, all properly authenticated: The charter or articles of incorporation; the minutes of organization; an excerpt from the minutes showing the names of the present officers of the corporation.<PRTPAGE P="564"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Where State laws vest in State or county officers, such as boards of supervisors and county courts, the power to authorize the construction of bridges, they must furnish with their application certified excerpts from their proceedings showing their action authorizing the proposed structure.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Plans.</E> One reproducible set of plans must be submitted with the application, on which the location of the work and the essential features covered by the application will be identified. Each drawing must have a title block located in the lower right-hand corner identifying the applicant/agent and bridge owner; the waterway; the milepoint on the waterway of the bridge location; the city, county, and state of the bridge location; the name of the bridge; the date of the plans; the sheet number; and the total number of sheets in the set.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Size of sheets.</E> The drawings will be on letter size sheets. As few sheets will be used as necessary to show clearly what is proposed.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Special instructions.</E> (1) Vertical and horizontal distances will be shown using bar scales. The north and south line will be indicated by a meridian arrow. Soundings and elevations will be shown in feet and refer to the established Government datum plane at the locality.</P>
            <P>(2) The direction of the current or, for tidal waters, the direction of the ebb and flow, will be indicated by arrow(s), and will be shown close to the proposed location of the bridge, and at both ends of the waterway shown on the map of location.</P>
            <P>(3) The plans will show in figures the least clear height of the lowest part of the superstructure over navigation openings, with reference to the planes of mean high water and mean low water if the bridge is to cross tidal water. If the waters are nontidal, the least clear height will be shown with reference to the planes of extreme high water and mean low water. If records of river heights are available, the 2 percent flowline (the plane above which flood waters have not remained more than 2 percent of the time) will be indicated. Reference will also be made to other datum planes if appropriate for the waterway in question.</P>
            <P>(4) If harbor lines have been established at the site of the bridge, their position will be shown on the plans.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Structural details.</E> Only those should be shown which are needed to illustrate the effect of the proposed structure on navigation. If the bridge is to be equipped with a draw, the latter will be shown in two positions: Closed and open. In those cases, the vertical and horizontal clearances shall be indicated in both the closed and open positions.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">To whom application should be presented.</E> The application and the papers and plans accompanying it should be submitted to the District Commander having jurisdiction over the area in which the bridge site is located.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for handling applications for bridge permits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following procedures will be observed in the handling of applications for permits to construct, modify, or replace bridges over navigable waters.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">District Commander's review of application and plans.</E> When an application is received, the District Commander verifies the authority for construction of the bridge, reviews the application and plans for sufficiency, ascertains the views of local authorities and other interested parties, and ensures that the application complies with relevant environmental laws, regulations, and orders. If the application contains any defects that would prevent issuance of a permit (as for example, if the proposed bridge provided insufficient clearance), the applicant is notified that the permit cannot be granted and given reasons for this determination. The applicant may then request that the application be considered by the Commandant. If the applicant makes such a request, or if the application is not found defective, the District Commander notifies the public that it has been received and continues <PRTPAGE P="565"/>its processing. A copy of this notification will be sent to the state, interstate agency or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responsible for acting on requests for water quality certification for the project. If the state, interstate agency, or the EPA fails to issue or deny the water quality certification within 30 days after receiving the copy of this notification, the requirements for a water quality certification are waived. If the appropriate agency notifies the District Commander that the applicant has not filed a request for water quality certification, or requests additional time to review an application, additional time will be granted.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Public meeting.</E> (1) Public meetings will be held when there are substantial issues concerning the effect that the proposed bridge will have on the reasonable needs of navigation.</P>

            <P>(2) Notice of the public meeting will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Notice of the meeting is also mailed to State, county, and municipal authorities and all other known interested parties. It is also posted at the post office nearest the site and public places in the vicinity.</P>
            <P>(3) Meetings are public and conducted in an informal manner. A designated Coast Guard official presides. The submission of written statements is invited and encouraged. Anyone desiring to do so may speak. Statements, written or oral, are not under oath, and cross-examination is not permitted. No fixed order has been established for the presentation of evidence or argument although proponents are generally heard first, followed by opponents with full opportunity afforded for rebuttals.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Report and recommendations.</E> After the close of the comment period and any public meeting, a detailed statement of findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on all available information (including Coast Guard records and experience) is prepared. The following factors may be discussed in this report:</P>
            <P>(1) Comparison of proposed bridge with existing bridges over the waterway; attitude of local authorities; summary of objections raised by the public, and District Commander's comments or responses; probable effect on navigation, present and prospective.</P>
            <P>(2) Description of the navigation on the waterway past the site of the proposed bridge, the number and type of vessels, the number of vessel trips, and the principal method of handling traffic, whether in single vessels or in tows.</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the District Commander approves, or recommends approval of the plans. If they are found objectionable, the reasons for this finding will be stated. If there are objectionable features in the plans which may be corrected, the applicant is given an opportunity to revise them. If approval is given or recommended, all conditions to which the permit should be subject will be stated.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Action on permit application.</E> (1) The District Commander may issue the permit if authorized under § 1.01-60(b) of this chapter; otherwise, a report with the application shall be submitted to the Commandant for final action.</P>
            <P>(2) When an application is approved, the issuing official signs the permit and transmits it to the applicant.</P>
            <P>(3) When an application is not approved, the applicant is notified and provided with reasons for the disapproval and suggestions for modifications that would justify reconsideration, if appropriate.</P>
            <P>(4) If an application is disapproved by the District Commander, the applicant may appeal this decision to the Commandant under § 114.50 of this chapter. The Commandant's determination shall constitute final agency action.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Permit amendments.</E> Applications for amendments to permits will be processed in the same manner as permit applications. The District Commander may approve amendments to any permits which that official is authorized to issue under § 1.01-60(b) of <PRTPAGE P="566"/>this chapter. All other amendments must be approved by the Commandant.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Advance approval of bridges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The General Bridge Act of 1946 requires the approval of the location and plans of bridges prior to start of construction (33 U.S.C. 525). The Commandant has given his advance approval to the location and plans of bridges to be constructed across reaches of waterways navigable in law, but not actually navigated other than by logs, log rafts, rowboats, canoes and small motorboats. In such cases the clearances provided for high water stages will be considered adequate to meet the reasonable needs of navigation. The Coast Guard recommends notice to the District Bridge Manager to ensure that the District has determined that advance approval provision is applicable to the waterway reach over which the bridge is to be constructed.</P>
            <P>(b) The term “small motorboats” shall be interpreted in the light of the things and conditions with which it is associated. The term means rowboats, canoes and other similar craft with outboard motors. It does not include sailing or cabin cruiser craft.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All bridges are obstructions to navigation and are tolerated only as long as they serve the needs of land transportation while allowing for the reasonable needs of navigation.</P>
            <P>(b) This part describes the general procedures by which the U.S. Coast Guard determines a bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and issues an Order to Alter under the authority of the following statutes, as appropriate: Section 18 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 502; Section 4 of the Bridge Act of 1906, 33 U.S.C. 494; or the Truman-Hobbs Act of 1940, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 511-524.</P>
            <P>(c) A bridge constructed across a navigable water of the United States shall not unreasonably obstruct the free navigation of the water over which it was constructed, either due to insufficient height or width of the navigation span, or because of difficulty in passing through the draw opening. If any bridge unreasonably obstructs navigation, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will order the alteration of that bridge. Alterations may include structural changes, replacement, or removal of the bridge.</P>

            <P>(d) Whenever the Coast Guard has good reason to believe that a bridge across any of the navigable waters of the United States is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Coast Guard will give notice to the owner of the bridge and other interested parties, <PRTPAGE P="567"/>and hold a public meeting at which the interested parties will have a full opportunity to be heard and to provide information on the question of whether alterations to the bridge are necessary and, if so, the extent of alterations needed.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Coast Guard determines that alterations to a bridge are necessary, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will issue to the bridge owner an Order to Alter containing details of the alterations necessary to render navigation through or under the bridge reasonably free, easy, and unobstructed.</P>

            <P>(1) In the case of a railroad or publicly owned highway bridge, an Order to Alter is issued to the bridge owner under the provisions of the Truman-Hobbs Act (33 U.S.C. 511 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). In ordering these alterations, the Coast Guard will give due regard to the necessities of free and unobstructed navigation and of rail and highway traffic. For alterations to bridges governed by the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Coast Guard must approve general plans, specifications, and contracts for the alteration project, as well as approving the apportionment of the total cost of the alterations between the United States and the bridge owner.</P>
            <P>(2) For all other bridges, the Order to Alter will contain the required alterations for the bridge and will prescribe a reasonable time in which to accomplish the required alterations. The bridge owner is responsible for the entire cost of the required alterations.</P>

            <P>(a) Upon receipt of a written complaint, the District Commander will review the complaint to determine if, in the District Commander's opinion, the complaint is justified and whether a Preliminary Investigation is warranted.</P>
            <P>(1) The District Commander's opinion as to whether or not the complaint warrants a Preliminary Investigation will be formed through informal discussions with the complainant, users of the affected waterway, the owner of the bridge, and other interested parties.</P>
            <P>(2) In forming an opinion, the District Commander may also review the district files, records of accidents, and details of any additional written complaints associated with the bridge in question.</P>
            <P>(b) In the absence of any written complaint, the District Commander may decide, based on a bridge's accident history or other criteria, to conduct a Preliminary Investigation.</P>
            <P>(c) The District Commander will inform the complainant and the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs of the determination of any Preliminary Review. If the District Commander decides that the bridge in question is not an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the complainant will be provided with a brief summary of the information on which the District Commander based the decision and will be informed of the appeal process described in § 116.55. There will be no further investigation, unless additional information warrants a continuance or reopening of the case.</P>

            <P>(b) The Preliminary Investigation Report will include a description of the nature and extent of the obstruction, the alterations to the bridge believed necessary to meet the reasonable needs of existing and future navigation, the type and volume of waterway traffic, <PRTPAGE P="568"/>and a calculation of the benefits to navigation which would result from the proposed bridge alterations.</P>
            <P>(c) The Chief, Office of Bridge Programs will review the Preliminary Investigation Report and make a Preliminary Decision whether or not to undertake a Detailed Investigation and a Public Meeting.</P>
            <P>(d) If after reviewing the Preliminary Investigation Report, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs decides that further investigation is not warranted, the complainant will be notified of the decision.

            <P>(a) When the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs determines that a Detailed Investigation should be conducted, the District Commander will initiate an investigation that addresses all of the pertinent data regarding the bridge, including information obtained at a public meeting held under § 116.25. As part of the investigation, the District Commander will develop a comprehensive report, termed the “Detailed Investigation Report”, which will discuss: the obstructive character of the bridge in question; the impact of that bridge upon navigation; navigational benefits derived; whether an alteration is needed to meet the needs of navigation; and, if alteration is recommended, what type.</P>
            <P>(b) The District Commander will forward the completed Detailed Investigation Report to the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs for review together with a recommendation of whether the bridge should be declared an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and, if so, whether an Order to Alter should be issued.</P>

            <P>(a) Any time the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs determines that a Detailed Investigation is warranted, or when Congress declares a bridge unreasonably obstructive, the District Commander will hold a public meeting near the location of the bridge to provide the bridge owner, waterway users, and other interested parties the opportunity to offer evidence and be heard, orally or in writing, as to whether any alterations are necessary to provide reasonably free, safe, and unobstructed passage for waterborne traffic. The District Commander will issue a public notice announcing the public meeting stating the time, date, and place of the meeting.</P>
            <P>(b) When a bridge is statutorily determined to be an unreasonable obstruction, the scope of the meeting will be to determine what navigation clearances are needed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Chief, Office of Bridge Programs Review and Evaluation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Upon receiving a Detailed Investigation Report from a District Commander, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs will review all the information and make a final determination of whether or not the bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and, if so, whether to issue an Order to Alter. This determination will be accompanied by a supporting written Decision Analysis which will include a Benefit/Cost Analysis, including calculation of a Benefit/Cost Ratio.</P>

            <P>(b) The Benefit/Cost ratio is calculated by dividing the annualized navigation benefit of the proposed bridge alteration by the annualized <PRTPAGE P="569"/>government share of the cost of the alteration.</P>
            <P>(c) Except for a bridge which is statutorily determined to be an unreasonable obstruction, an Order to Alter will not be issued under the Truman-Hobbs Act unless the ratio is at least 1:1.</P>
            <P>(d) If a bridge is statutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct navigation, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs will prepare a Decision Analysis to document and provide details of the required vertical and horizontal clearances and the reasons alterations are necessary.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs decides to recommend that the Commandant issue an Order to Alter, or a bridge is statutorily determined to unreasonably obstruct navigation, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs will issue a letter to the bridge owner (“The 60-Day Letter”) at least 60 days before the Commandant issues an Order to Alter. This letter will contain the reasons an alteration is necessary, the proposed alteration, and, in the case of a Truman-Hobbs bridge, an estimate of the total project cost and the bridge owner's share.</P>
            <P>(f) If the bridge owner does not agree with the terms proposed in the 60-Day Letter, the owner may request a reevaluation of the terms. The request for a reevaluation must be in writing, and identify the terms for which reevaluation is requested. The request may provide additional information not previously presented.</P>
            <P>(g) Upon receipt of the bridge owner's response, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs will reevaluate the situation based on the additional information submitted by the bridge owner. If after the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs reviews the determination, there is no change, the Commandant may issue an Order to Alter as set out in § 116.35. The Administrator, Office of Bridge Programs determination based on the reevaluation will constitute final agency action.</P>

            <P>(a) If the bridge owner agrees with the contents of the 60-Day Letter, if no reply is received by 60 days after the issuance of the letter, or if after reevaluation a bridge is determined to be an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Commandant will issue an Order to Alter.</P>
            <P>(1) If a bridge is eligible for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Order to Alter will specify the navigational clearances to be accomplished in order to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.</P>
            <P>(2) An Order to Alter for a bridge that is not eligible for Truman-Hobbs funding will specify the navigational clearances that are required to meet the reasonable needs of navigation and will prescribe a reasonable time in which to accomplish them.</P>
            <P>(b) If appropriate, the Order to Alter will be accompanied by a letter of special conditions setting forth safeguards needed to protect the environment or to provide for any special needs of navigation.</P>
            <P>(c) If a proposed alteration to a bridge has desirable, non-navigational benefits, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs may require an equitable contribution from any interested person, firm, association, corporation, municipality, county, or state benefiting from the alteration as a prerequisite to the making of an Order to Alter for that alteration.</P>
            <P>(d) Failure to comply with any Order to Alter issued under the provisions of this part will subject the owner or controller of the bridge to the penalties prescribed in 33 U.S.C. 495, 502, 519, or any other applicable provision.</P>

The plans and specifications, at a minimum, must provide for the clearances identified in the Order to Alter. The plans and specifications may also include any other additional alteration to the bridge that the owner considers desirable to meet the requirements of railroad or highway traffic. During the alteration process, balanced consideration shall be given to the needs of rail, highway, and marine traffic.</P>
            <P>(b) The Chief, Office of Bridge Programs will approve or reject the plans and specifications submitted by the bridge owner, in whole or in part, and may require the submission of new or additional plans and specifications.</P>
            <P>(c) When Chief, Office of Bridge Programs has approved the submitted plans and specifications, they are final and binding upon all parties, unless later changes are approved by the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs.

            <P>(a) Once the plans and specifications for a bridge eligible for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act have been approved, the bridge owner must take bids for the alteration of the bridge consistent with the approved plans and specifications. Those bids must then be submitted to the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs for approval.</P>
            <P>(b) After the bridge owner submits the guaranty of cost required by 33 U.S.C. 515, the Chief, Office of Bridge Programs authorizes the owner to award the contract.</P>
            <P>(c) Partial payments of the government's costs are authorized as the work progresses to the extent that funds have been appropriated.</P>

            <P>(a) In determining the apportionment of costs, the bridge owner must bear such part of the cost attributable to the direct and special benefits which will accrue to the bridge owner as a result of alteration to the bridge, including expected savings in repairs and maintenance, expected increased carrying capacity, costs attributable to the requirements of highway and railroad traffic, and actual capital costs of the used service life. The United States will bear the balance of the costs, including that part attributable to the necessities of navigation.</P>
            <P>(b) “Direct and special benefits” ordinarily will include items desired by the owner but which have no counterpart or are of higher quality than similar items in the bridge prior to alteration. Examples include improved signal and fender systems, pro rata share of dismantling costs, and improvements included, but not required, in the interests of navigation.</P>

            <P>(c) During the development of the Apportionment of Costs, the bridge owner will be provided with an opportunity to be heard. Proportionate shares of cost to be borne by the United States and the bridge owner are developed in substantially the following form:

              <P>(a) This part prescribes the general and special drawbridge operating regulations that apply to the drawbridges across the navigable waters of the United States and its territories. The authority to regulate drawbridges across the navigable waters of the United States is vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security.</P>
              <P>(b) Subpart A contains the general operation requirements that apply to all drawbridges.</P>
              <P>(c) Subpart B contains specific requirements for operation of individual drawbridges. These requirements are in addition to or vary from the general requirements in Subpart A. Specific sections in subpart B that vary from a general requirement in Subpart A supersede the general requirement. All other general requirements in Subpart A, that are not at variance, apply to the drawbridges and removable span bridges listed in Subpart B.</P>

                <P>(a) Across the Arkansas Waterway, the draw of the Rob Roy Drawbridge, mile 67.4, at Pine Bluff, Arkansas is maintained in the closed to navigation position and is remotely operated. Any vessel which requires an opening of the draw of this bridge shall establish contact by radiotelephone with the remote drawbridge operator on VHF-FM Channel 12 in Omaha, Nebraska. To establish contact, the vessel shall key the VHF-FM radio microphone four times in five seconds and listen for an acknowledgement tone. The remote drawbridge operator will then establish normal verbal radio communication on VHF-FM Channel 12 and advise the vessel whether the requested span can be immediately opened and will maintain constant radio contact with the vessel until the requested span has opened and vessel passage has been completed. The bridge is equipped with a Photoelectric Boat Detection System to prevent the span from lowering if there is an obstruction under the span. If the drawbridge cannot be opened immediately, the remote drawbridge operator will notify the calling vessel and provide an estimated time for a drawspan opening.</P>
                <P>(b) Across the Arkansas Waterway, the draw of the Baring Cross Railroad Drawbridge, mile 119.6 at Little Rock, Arkansas, is maintained in the closed position and is remotely operated.

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Normal flow procedures.</E> Any vessel which requires an opening of the draw of this bridge shall establish contact by radiotelephone with the remote drawbridge operator on VHF-FM Channel 13 in Omaha, Nebraska. To establish contact, the vessel shall key the VHF-FM radio microphone four times in five seconds and listen for an acknowledgement tone. The remote drawbridge operator will then establish normal verbal radio communication on VHF-FM Channel 13 and advise the vessel whether the requested span can be immediately opened and will maintain constant radio contact with the vessel until the requested span has opened and vessel passage has been completed. The bridge is equipped with a Photoelectric Boat Detection System to prevent the span from lowering if there is an obstruction under the span.

                <P>(2) <E T="03">High velocity flow procedures.</E> The area from mile 118.2 to mile 125.4 is a regulated navigation area as described in § 165.817. During periods of high velocity flow rate of 70,000 cubic feet per second or greater at the Murray Lock and Dam, mile 125.4, downbound vessels which require that the draw of this bridge be opened for unimpeded passage shall contact the remote drawbridge operator as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section either before departing Murray Lock and Dam or before departing the mooring cells at mile 121.5 to ensure that the drawspan is opened well in advance of arrival at the bridge. The remote drawbridge operator shall immediately respond to the vessel's contact, ensure the drawspan is open for passage, and ensure that it remains in the open to navigation position until the downbound vessel has safely passed through. If it cannot be opened immediately for unimpeded passage in accordance with § 165.817, the remote drawbridge operator will notify the downbound vessel and provide an estimated time for a drawspan opening. Upbound vessels shall request openings in accordance with the normal flow procedures as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The remote drawbridge operator shall keep these approaching vessels informed of the position of the drawspan at all times until safe passage is completed.</P>

                <P>(c) Across the Arkansas Waterway, the draw of the Van Buren Railroad Drawbridge, mile 300.8 at Van Buren, Arkansas, is maintained in the open position except as follows:<PRTPAGE P="585"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) When a train approaches the bridge, amber lights attached to the bridge begin to flash and an audible signal on the bridge sounds. At the end of 10 minutes, the amber light continues to flash; however, the audible signal stops and the draw lowers and locks if the photoelectric boat detection system detects no obstruction under the span. If there is an obstruction, the draw opens to its full height until the obstruction is cleared.</P>
                <P>(2) After the train clears the bridge, the draw opens to its full height, the amber flashing light stops, and the mid channel lights change from red to green, indicating the navigation channel is open for the passage of vessels.</P>

                <P>(a) The draw of the automated Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad bridge, mile 88.8 at Beardstown, Illinois, operates as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, displaying a green light to indicate that vessels may pass.<PRTPAGE P="610"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) When a vessel is approaching and the draw is in the open position, contact shall be established by radiotelephone with the remote operator to assure that the draw remains open until passage is complete.</P>
                <P>(3) When a vessel is approaching and the draw is in the closed position, contact shall be established by radiotelephone with the remote operator. If the draw cannot be opened immediately, alternate flashing red lights are displayed. If the draw can be opened immediately, flashing amber lights are displayed.</P>
                <P>(4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open position, the operator shall activate alternate flashing red lights on top of the draw, sound four short blasts, and scan the river on radar to determine whether any vessel is approaching the bridge. The remote operator shall also broadcast that the draw is closing. If a vessel or vessels are approaching the bridge within one mile, as determined by radar scanning, response to radio broadcast, or electronic detector, the flashing red lights shall be changed to flashing amber and the operator shall keep the draw in the fully open position until the vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge. If no vessel is approaching the bridge or is beneath the draw, the draw may be lowered and locked in place.</P>
                <P>(5) After the train has cleared the bridge, the draw shall be raised to its full height and locked in place, the red flashing lights stopped, and the draw lights changed from red to green.</P>
                <P>(b) The draw of the Chessie Railroad Bridge, mile 254.1, at Seneca, Illinois, operates as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, displaying green mid-channel lights to indicate the span is fully open.</P>
                <P>(2) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open position, the train will stop, train operator shall walk out on the bridge and scan the river for approaching vessels.</P>
                <P>(3) If a vessel is approaching the bridge, the draw will remain open. The vessel shall contact the train operator on VHF-FM channel 16 and the train operator shall keep the draw in the fully open position until the vessel has cleared the bridge.</P>
                <P>(4) If no vessels are observed, the train operator initiates a five minute warning period on VHF-FM radio channel 16 before closing the bridge. The train operator will broadcast the following message: “The Chessie Railroad Bridge at Mile 254.1, Illinois River, will close to navigation in five minutes.” The announcement is repeated every minute counting down the time remaining until closure.</P>
                <P>(5) At the end of the five minute warning period, and if no vessels are approaching the bridge, the train operator shall sound the siren for 10 seconds, activate the alternate flashing red lights on top of the draw, then lower and lock the draw in place. Red lights shall continue to flash to indicate the draw is closed to navigation.</P>
                <P>(6) After the train has cleared the bridge, the draw shall be raised to its full height and locked in place, the red flashing lights stopped, and the draw lights changed from red to green.</P>
                <P>(c) The draws of the McDonough Street Bridge, mile 287.3; Jefferson Street bridge, mile 287.9; Cass Street bridge, mile 288.1; Jackson Street bridge, mile 288.4; and Ruby Street bridge, mile 288.7; all of Joliet, shall open on signal, except that they need not open from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through Saturday.</P>
                <P>(d) The drawspan of the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway bridge, mile 290.1 at Lockport, Illinois, is operated by remote operator located at the Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern offices in Homewood, Illinois as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The drawspan is normally maintained in the fully open to navigation position displaying green center span navigation lights to indicate that the drawspan is fully open.</P>
                <P>(2) The bridge is equipped with the following:</P>
                <P>(i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;</P>
                <P>(ii) A radar antenna on top of the drawspan capable of scanning the river, one mile upstream and one mile downstream;</P>

                <P>(iii) Infrared boat detectors under the drawspan, to allow the remote bridge <PRTPAGE P="611"/>operator to detect vessels under the drawspan;</P>
                <P>(iv) Electronic motion detectors under the drawspan to allow the remote bridge operator to detect vessel movement under the drawspan;</P>
                <P>(v) A siren for sound signals; and</P>
                <P>(vi) Red and green center span navigation lights.</P>
                <P>(3) The remote bridge operator shall maintain a 24 hour VHF marine radio watch for mariners to establish contact as they approach the bridge to ensure that the drawspan is open or that it remains open until passage of river traffic is complete.</P>
                <P>(4) When rail traffic approaches the bridge, and the drawspan is in the open position, the remote bridge operator initiates a one minute warning period before closing the drawspan. During this warning period, the remote operator shall broadcast at least twice, via marine radio, that: “The drawspan of the EJ&amp;E Railroad bridge will be lowered in one minute.” A siren on the bridge sounds for 20 seconds, to warn anyone on or under the bridge that the drawspan will be lowered.</P>
                <P>(5) If a vessel is approaching the bridge upbound or, departing the Lockport Lock and Dam at mile 291.1, downbound, with intentions of passing through the drawspan, they shall respond to the remote bridge operators' marine radio broadcast, or initiate radio contact, indicating their proximity to the bridge and requesting an opening of the drawspan or that the drawspan remain open until the vessel passes. If any approaching vessel is detected or if a radiotelephone response is received, the remote operator shall not close the drawspan until the vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge.</P>
                <P>(6) At the end of the one minute warning period, if no river traffic is approaching or under the drawspan, the remote bridge operator may begin lowering the drawspan. Navigation lights located at the center of the drawspan change from green to red when the drawspan is not in the fully open to navigation position. The drawspan takes approximately 90 seconds to lower.</P>
                <P>(7) If the presence of a vessel or other obstruction is discovered approaching or under the drawspan, during the lowering sequence, before the drawspan is fully lowered and locked, the drawspan shall be stopped and raised to the fully open position. When the vessel or obstruction has cleared the drawspan, the remote operator shall confirm that the channel is clear and reinitiate the one minute warning cycle before lowering the drawspan.</P>
                <P>(8) If no marine traffic is present the drawspan may be lowered and seated. When the drawspan is lowered and locked in the closed to navigation position, the remote bridge operator periodically broadcasts, via marine radio, that: “The drawspan of the EJ&amp;E Railroad bridge is closed to navigation.”</P>
                <P>(9) Failure of the radar system, radio telephone system, infrared boat detectors or electronic motion sensors shall prevent lowering the drawspan from the remote location.</P>
                <P>(10) when rail traffic has cleared the bridge, the remote bridge operator shall raise the drawspan to the fully open to navigation position. When the drawspan is raised and in the fully open to navigation position, the remote bridge operator broadcasts, at least twice, via marine radio, that: “The drawspan of the EJ&amp;E Railroad bridge is open to navigation.” The center drawspan navigation lights change from red to green when the drawspan is fully open to navigation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Lake Pontchartrain.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The south draw of the S11 bridge near New Orleans shall open on signal if at least 48 hours notice is given. In case of emergency, the draw shall open within 12 hours and shall be kept in condition for immediate operation until the emergency is over.</P>
                <P>(b) The draw of the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge across Lake Pontchartrain, mile 4.80 near Slidell, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana shall be maintained as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The draw shall be maintained in the fully open-to-navigation position for vessels at all times, except during periods when it is closed for the passage of rail traffic or to perform periodic maintenance authorized in accordance with subpart A of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) The draw shall be remotely operated by the drawtender at Norfolk Southern's drawbridge in Decatur, Alabama. The estimated duration that the bridge will remain closed for the passage of rail traffic is 10 to 15 minutes per operation.</P>
                <P>(3) When a train approaches the bridge, the drawtender will initiate the bridge closing warning signal, consisting of radio calls via VHF-FM-channels 13 and 16 and activation of flashing red warning lights at each end of the span. The radio calls will be broadcast at five (5) minutes prior to bridge closing and at two (2) minutes prior to bridge closing. Photoelectric (infrared) boat detectors will monitor the waterway beneath the bridge for the presence of vessels.</P>
                <P>(4) The drawtender will continuously monitor waterway traffic in the area using closed-circuit cameras mounted on the bridge. The draw will only be closed if the drawtender's visual inspection indicates that the channel is clear and there are no vessels transiting in the area. The drawtender will maintain constant surveillance of the navigation channel to ensure that no conflict with maritime traffic exists. Additionally, the draw will not be closed if the S11 bascule bridge that is located immediately west of the railroad bridge is in the open-to-navigation position. If two or more closed-circuit cameras are inoperable or if there is inclement weather, the draw will only be operated by a drawtender located on site at the bridge.</P>
                <P>(5) At the end of the two-minute warning period, if no vessels have been detected by the drawtender, the draw closing sequence will automatically proceed.</P>
                <P>(6) Upon passage of the train, the draw will be returned to the fully open-to-navigation position to allow marine traffic to pass. The warning lights will continue to flash red until the draw has returned to the fully open-to-navigation position at which time they will deactivate.</P>
                <P>(7) After the passage of each train, the draw must be returned to its fully open-to-navigation position.</P>
                <P>(8) To request openings of the draw when the bascule span is in the closed-to-navigation position, mariners may contact Norfolk Southern Railway via VHF-FM channel 13 or by telephone at the number displayed on the signs posted at the bridge.</P>
                <P>(9) The draw will be operated locally if:</P>
                <P>(i) Communication is lost between the drawbridge and the drawtender in Decatur, Alabama;</P>
                <P>(ii) More than two closed-circuit cameras are not working;</P>
                <P>(iii) The marine radio is inoperable;</P>
                <P>(iv) Weather conditions warrant; or</P>
                <P>(v) Ordered by the Coast Guard.</P>

                <P>(c) The draw of the Greater New Orleans Expressway Commission Causeway shall open on signal if at least three hours notice is given; except that, the draw need not be opened for the passage of vessels Monday through Friday except Federal holidays from 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and from 3 p.m. until 7 p.m. The draw will open on signal for any <PRTPAGE P="618"/>vessel in distress or vessel waiting immediately following the closures listed above.</P>

                <P>The draw of the Canadian National/Illinois Central Railroad automated bridge, mile 6.7, at Manchac, operates as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) The draw is not constantly manned and the bridge will normally be maintained in the open position, providing 56 feet vertical clearance above mean high tide to the raised tip of the bascule span for one-half the channel, and unlimited vertical clearance for the other half.</P>
                <P>(b) Railroad track circuits will detect an approaching train and initiate bridge closing warning broadcasts over marine radio and over the Public Address (PA) system six (6) minutes in advance of the train's arrival. Navigation channel warning lights will be lit, and photoelectric (infrared) boat detectors will monitor the waterway beneath the bridge for the presence of vessels. The waterway approaches to the bridge will be monitored by closed circuit TV (CCTV) cameras.</P>
                <P>(c) Activation of the warning broadcasts also activates a marine radio monitor in the Mays Yard (New Orleans switch yard). The yardmaster will continuously monitor marine radio broadcasts on the normal and emergency marine radio channels throughout the warning period and at all times the bridge is closed. The yardmaster will communicate with waterway users via the marine radio, if necessary.</P>
                <P>(d) At the end of warning period, if no vessels have been detected by the boat detectors, and no interruptions have been performed by the yardmaster based on his monitoring of the marine radio and the CCTV, the bridge lowering sequence will automatically proceed.</P>
                <P>(e) Upon passage of the train, the bridge will automatically open. Railroad track circuits will initiate the automatic bridge opening and closing sequences. (Estimated duration that the bridge will remain closed for passage of rail traffic is 10 to 12 minutes.) The bridge will also be manually operable from two locked trackside control locations (key releases) on the approach spans, one on each side of the movable span.</P>
                <P>(f) The yardmaster will be provided with a remote EMERGENCY STOP button which, if pressed, will stop the bridge operation, interrupt the lowering sequence, and immediately return the bridge to the open position. The yardmaster will utilize this control feature in the event a vessel operator issues an urgent radio call to keep the waterway open for immediate passage of the vessel.</P>

                <P>The SR1A bridge, mile 0.0 at Hampton, operates as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) The draw shall open on signal from April 1 through October 31 for the passage of vessels during daylight hours from three hours before to three hours after each high tide. “Daylight hours” means one-half hour before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset. High tide occurs one-half hour later than the time of high tide for Portland, Maine, as published in the tide tables published by private entities using data provided by the National Ocean Service. At all other times, the draw shall open on signal if at least three hours notice is given.</P>
                <P>(b) The owners of the bridge shall provide and keep in good legible condition two board gages painted white with black figures not less than six inches high to indicate the vertical clearance under the closed draw at all stages of the tide. The gages shall be so placed on the bridge that they are plainly visible to operators of vessels approaching the bridge either up or downstream.</P>

                <P>(c) Vessels which can pass under the closed draw with a clearance of one foot or more shall not signal for the opening of the draw. In case a vessel gives the prescribed signal and the drawtender is uncertain as to whether the vessel can safely pass, the drawtender shall open the draw. If the drawtender finds that there would have been a clearance of one foot or more had the draw remained closed, the matter shall be reported immediately to the District Commander, giving the name of the vessel, the time of opening <PRTPAGE P="639"/>the draw, the clearance under the bridge as indicated by the gage at the time of opening the draw, and the approximate vertical clearance required by the vessel.</P>

                <P>(a) The draw of the Arthur Kill (AK) Railroad Bridge shall be maintained in the full open position for navigation at all times, except during periods when it is closed for the passage of rail traffic.</P>
                <P>(b) The bridge owner/operator shall maintain a dedicated telephone hot line for vessel operators to call the bridge in advance to coordinate anticipated bridge closures. The telephone hot line number shall be posted on signs at the bridge clearly visible from both the up and downstream sides of the bridge.</P>
                <P>(c) Tide constrained deep draft vessels shall notify the bridge operator, daily, of their expected times of vessel transits through the bridge, by calling the designated telephone hot line.</P>
                <P>(d) The bridge shall not be closed for the passage of rail traffic during any predicted high tide period if a tide constrained deep draft vessel has provided the bridge operator with an advance notice of their intent to transit through the bridge. For the purposes of this regulation, the predicted high tide period shall be considered to be from two hours before each predicted high tide to a half-hour after each predicted high tide taken at the Battery, New York.</P>
                <P>(e) The bridge operator shall issue a manual broadcast notice to mariners of the intent to close the bridge for a period of up to 30 minutes for the passage of rail traffic, on VHF-FM channels 13 and 16 (minimum range of 15 miles) 90 minutes before and again at 75 minutes before each bridge closure.</P>
                <P>(f) Beginning at 60 minutes prior to each bridge closure, automated or manual broadcast notice to mariners must be repeated at 15 minute intervals and again at 10 and 5 minutes prior to each bridge closure and once again as the bridge begins to close, at which point the appropriate sound signal will be given.</P>
                <P>(g) Two 15 minute bridge closures may be provided each day for the passage of multiple rail traffic movements across the bridge. Each 15 minute bridge closure shall be separated by at least a 30 minute period when the bridge is returned to and remains in the full open position. Notification of the two 15 minute closures shall follow the same procedures outlined in paragraphs (e) and (f) above.</P>
                <P>(h) A vessel operator may request up to a 30 minute delay for any bridge closure in order to allow vessel traffic to meet tide or current requirements; however, the request to delay the bridge closure must be made within 30 minutes following the initial broadcast for the bridge closure. Requests received after the initial 30 minute broadcast will not be granted.</P>

                <P>(i) In the event of a bridge operational failure, the bridge operator shall immediately notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port New York. The bridge owner/operator must provide and dispatch a bridge repair crew to be on scene at the bridge no later than 45 minutes after the bridge fails to operate. A repair crew must remain on scene during the operational failure until the bridge has been fully restored <PRTPAGE P="640"/>to normal operations or until the bridge is raised and locked in the fully open position.</P>
                <P>(j) When the bridge is not tended locally it must be operated from a remote location. A sufficient number of closed circuit TV cameras, approved by the Coast Guard, shall be operated and maintained at the bridge site to enable the remotely located bridge tender to have full view of both river traffic and the bridge.</P>
                <P>(k) VHF-FM channels 13 and 16 shall be maintained and monitored to facilitate communication in both the remote and local control locations. The bridge shall also be equipped with directional microphones and horns to receive and deliver signals to vessels.</P>
                <P>(l) Whenever the remote control system equipment is disabled or fails to operate for any reason, the bridge operator shall immediately notify the Captain of the Port New York. The bridge shall be physically tended and operated by local control as soon as possible, but no more than 45 minutes after malfunction or disability of the remote system.</P>
                <P>(m) Mechanical bypass and override capability of the remote operation system shall be provided and maintained at all times.</P>

                <P>(a) The draw shall be unmanned and when a vessel with AIS equipment onboard approaches the two-mile post, the dispatcher will receive a prompt to open the bridge, if required, because a vessel is approaching. The vessel may continue to transit the waterway, but must tune their radiotelephone to VHF-FM channel 13 and receive passing instructions from the railroad dispatcher. The dispatcher must contact the vessel promptly to provide passing instruction to insure the continued safe transit of the vessel. Vessels without AIS equipment or vessels with AIS who would prefer to call via telephone, may call the railroad dispatcher at 800-262-4691 to arrange passing instructions.</P>
                <P>(b) When any vessel approaches the one-mile post, the railroad dispatcher should have either cleared the vessel through the bridge or given an indication that a train is in the block and the vessel will be cleared as soon as practicable. If the vessel has not yet spoken with the railroad dispatcher, the vessel should immediately call the railroad dispatcher via telephone at 800-262-4691.</P>

                <P>(4) A sufficient number of infrared cameras shall be maintained in good working order at all times with a clear unobstructed view of the channel under the bridge, and the up and down stream approaches to the bridge. A signal horn and message boards located both up and down stream, necessary to warn marine traffic that the bridge will be closing, shall also be maintained in good working order at all times. In the event that any of the cameras, navigation lights, horn, or message board become disabled, personnel shall be deployed to the bridge to be on scene within two hours from the known time of the equipment failure.</P>
                <P>(5) The draw may operate remotely as follows: Once it is determined that the draw must be opened or closed, the train dispatcher shall observe the waterway both up and down stream via the infrared cameras to verify that the channel is clear of all approaching vessel traffic. All approaching vessel traffic shall be allowed to pass before the bridge may be closed. Once it is determined that no vessel traffic is approaching the dispatcher shall sound the warning horn and activate the up and down stream message boards indicating that the bridge will be closing. After at least a one minute delay the draw may then be closed and the swing span navigation lights shall display as red to indicate the bridge is in the closed position. Once the train clears the bridge the draw shall be returned to the full open position and the swing span lights shall display as green to indicate the draw is in the full open position.</P>
                <P>(6) In the event that the dispatcher cannot verify that the channel is clear of all vessel traffic and the bridge cannot be safely closed, an on-scene train crewmember shall observe the waterway for any vessel traffic and then communicate with the train dispatch office either by radio or telephone to request the bridge be safely closed. Personnel shall then be deployed to the bridge to arrive within two hours to inspect and repair the bridge remote operation equipment.</P>
                <P>(7) The bridge shall be operated manually from the tender's house located at the bridge until all necessary repairs are completed to the remote operation equipment.</P>

The bridge will only be closed if the off-site remote operator's visual inspection shows that the channel is clear and there are no vessels transiting in the area.</P>

                <P>(5) While the bridge is moving from the full open position to the full closed position, the off-site remote operator will maintain constant surveillance of the navigation channel to ensure that no conflict with maritime traffic exists. In the event of failure or obstruction, the off-site remote operator will stop and return the bridge to the full open position to vessels. In the event of a failure or obstruction, a bridge tender must be called by the off-site remote operator and must be on-site <PRTPAGE P="676"/>within 30 minutes of the call to operate the bridge.</P>
                <P>(6) During closing of the span, the channel traffic lights will change from flashing green to flashing red, the horn will sound twice, and an audio voice warning device will announce bridge movement, then two repeat blasts of the horn will sound until the bridge is seated and locked down. When the bridge is seated and locked down to vessels, the channel traffic lights will flash red.</P>
                <P>(7) During the open span movement, the channel traffic lights will flash red, the horn will sound twice, followed by a pause, and then five repeat blasts of the horn will sound until the bridge is in the full open position to vessels. In the full open position to vessels, the bridge channel traffic lights will turn from flashing red to flashing green then an audio warning device will announce bridge movement by stating “Security, security, security, the Norfolk Southern #7 Railroad Bridge at mile 5.8 is open for river traffic”.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Elizabeth River—Eastern Branch.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The draw of the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge (NS #V2.8), mile 2.7 at Norfolk, shall operate as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The draw shall remain in the open position for navigation. The draw shall only be closed for train crossings or periodic maintenance authorized in accordance with subpart A of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) The bridge shall be operated by the controller at the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge (NS #5), mile 1.1, over the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Norfolk, VA. The controller shall monitor vessel traffic with closed circuit cameras and infrared sensors covering the swing radius. Operational information will be provided 24 hours a day on marine channel 13 and via telephone (757) 446-5320.</P>
                <P>(3) The bridge shall not be operated from the remote location in the following events: Failure or obstruction of the infrared sensors, closed-circuit cameras or marine-radio communications, or anytime controller's visibility is inhibited. In these situations, a bridge tender with Norfolk Southern must be called to operate the bridge on-site.</P>
                <P>(4) Before the bridge closes for any reason, the remote operator will monitor waterway traffic in the area. The bridge shall only be closed if the off-site remote operator's visual inspection shows that the channel is clear and there are no vessels transiting in the area. While the bridge is moving, the operator shall maintain constant surveillance of the navigation channel.</P>
                <P>(5) Before closing the draw, the channel traffic lights will change from flashing green to flashing red, the horn will sound five short blasts, and an audio voice warning stating, “Attention, Attention. Norfolk Southern's Railroad Bridge over the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River at milepost 2.7 will be closing to river traffic.” Five short blasts of the horn will continue until the bridge is seated and locked down to vessels, the channel traffic lights will continue to flash red.</P>

                <P>(6) When the rail traffic has cleared, the horn will sound one prolonged blast followed by one short blast to indicate that the draw is opening to vessel traffic. During the opening swing movement, the channel traffic lights will flash red until the bridge returns to the fully open position. In the full open position to vessels, the bridge channel lights will flash green followed by an announcement stating, “Security, security, security. Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge at mile 2.7 is open for river traffic.” Vessels shall stay clear of both channels as to not interfere <PRTPAGE P="678"/>with infrared detectors, until green lights are displayed on the swing span.</P>
                <P>(b) The draw of the Berkley Bridge, mile 0.4 in Norfolk:</P>
                <P>(1) Shall remain closed one hour prior to the published start of a scheduled marine event regulated under § 100.501 of this chapter, and shall remain closed until one hour following the completion of the event unless the Patrol Commander designated under § 100.501 of this chapter allows the bridge to open for commercial vessel traffic.</P>
                <P>(2) Shall open on signal at any time for vessels carrying, in bulk, cargoes regulated by 46 CFR subchapters D or O, or Certain Dangerous Cargoes as defined in 33 CFR 160.202.</P>
                <P>(3) For all other vessels, the draw shall open on signal at any time, except from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. During these times, the draw shall:</P>
                <P>(i) Open for commercial vessels with a draft of 18 feet or more, provided at least 6 hours notice was given to the Berkley Bridge Traffic Control room at (757) 494-2490.</P>
                <P>(ii) Open on signal at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.</P>
                <P>(4) If the bridge is not opened during a particular scheduled opening per paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and a vessel has made prior arrangements for a delayed opening, the draw tender may provide a single opening up to 30 minutes past that scheduled opening time for that signaling vessel, except at 2:30 p.m. The draw tender may provide a single opening up to 20 minutes past the 2:30 p.m. scheduled opening time for a signaling vessel that made prior arrangements for a delayed opening. A vessel may make prior arrangements for a delayed opening by contacting the Berkley Bridge Traffic Control room at (757) 494-2490.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Columbia River.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The term <E T="03">drawtender,</E> as used in this section means the operator of the drawspan, whether that person may be a train crew member, maintenance person, or an officially designated drawtender.</P>
                <P>(b) The draw of the semi-automated Union Pacific railroad bridge (Kalan Bridge), mile 323.4, near Kennewick, Washington, is normally maintained in the fully open position with no drawtender in attendance. A radar beacon (RACON) is located at the center of the drawspan. The RACON operates only when the drawspan is fully open, by responding with the Morse letter “K” to X-band radar signals. When necessary to close the drawspan for the passage of a train or for maintenance, a drawtender shall be dispatched to operate the draw from either of the remote control stations located at the ends of the bridge. Operation of the bridge shall be as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The drawtender shall broadcast a radio message over Channel 16-VHF to all vessels in the vicinity that the Kalan Bridge will be closing in two minutes. If after two minutes no response is received, the drawtender shall broadcast a message over Channel 13-VHF that the Kalan Bridge is closing. Both messages shall be broadcast twice.</P>
                <P>(2) Prior to activating the closing sequence the drawtender shall visually inspect the waterway for marine traffic approaching the bridge. The closing sequence shall not be activated until after marine traffic has cleared the bridge.</P>
                <P>(3) When the closing sequence is activated, the following functions occur automatically: The RACON is deactivated, red strobe lights on the lift towers and on the channel piers start flashing, a downward pointing arrow consisting of amber colored lights is displayed from the center of the drawspan and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF advising that the Kalan Bridge is closed to river traffic. The radio message is repeated every five minutes, the red lights continue to flash and the downward pointing arrow is displayed, until the lift span returns to the up and locked position. At the end of the ten minutes, a horn sounds for 30 seconds, the span begins closing and the centerspan navigation lights turn from green to red. The horn sounds for 30 seconds at 10 minute intervals, until the lift span returns to the up and locked position.</P>
                <P>(4) If for any reason during the closing sequence a danger is posed to marine traffic, the closing sequence shall be stopped and the bridge reopened until the threat of danger has passed.</P>
                <P>(5) If the bridge is to be temporarily closed for maintenance or for purposes other than the passage of a train, the drawtender shall continually monitor Channels 13 and 16 for calls from approaching vessels, and respond to inquiries from vessels about the closure.</P>
                <P>(6) After a train has cleared the bridge, the following functions occur automatically: The drawspan returns to the fully open and locked position, the RACON is reactivated, the arrow display and the red strobe lights are extinguished, the red centerspan navigation lights return to green and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF that the Kalan Bridge is open for marine traffic.</P>

                <P>(7) Bridge status information may be obtained by calling the commercial <PRTPAGE P="680"/>telephone number posted at the drawspan of the bridge.</P>
                <P>(c) The draw of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad bridge at mile 328.0, between Pasco and Kennewick, shall open on signal from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. At all other times the draw shall open on signal if at least 2 hour's notice is given through the General Yardmaster, Pasco, Washington.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Vertical clearance gauges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When necessary for reasons of safety of navigation, the District Commander may require or authorize the installation of clearance gauges. Except as specified in § 117.47(b) of this chapter for certain drawbridges, clearance gauges must meet the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) Clearance gauges must indicate the vertical distance between “low steel” of the bridge channel span (in the closed to navigation position for drawbridges) and the level of the water, measured to the bottom of the foot marks, read from top to bottom. Each gauge must be installed on the end of the right channel pier or pier protection structure facing approaching vessels and extend to a reasonable height above high water so as to be meaningful to the viewer. Other or additional locations may be prescribed by the District Commander if particular conditions or circumstances warrant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction.</E> Each gauge must be permanently fixed to the bridge pier or pier protection structure and made of a durable material of sufficient strength to provide resistance to weather, tide, and current. Gauges may be painted directly on the bridge channel pier or pier protection structure if the surface is suitable and has sufficient width to accommodate the foot marks (graduations) and numerals.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Numerals.</E> (1) Each gauge must be marked by black numerals and foot marks on a white background. Paint, if used, must be of good exterior quality, resistant to excessive chalking or bleeding. Manufactured numerals and background material may be used.</P>
            <P>(2) The size, type, and spacing of numerals must conform to the Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs and the following table. The nominal day visibility distance is the distance at which the clearance information needs to be ascertained by approaching vessel operators. The District Commander determines this distance for each bridge.</P>
