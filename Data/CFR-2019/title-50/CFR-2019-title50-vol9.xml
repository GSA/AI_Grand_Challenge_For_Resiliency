      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) This part 18 applies solely to marine mammals and marine mammal products as defined in § 18.3. For regulations under the Act with respect to cetacea (whales and porpoises), pinnipedia, other than walrus (seals and sea lions), see 50 CFR part 216.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions in this part are in addition to, and are not in lieu of, other regulations of this subchapter B which may require a permit or prescribe additional restrictions or conditions for the importation, exportation, and interstate transportation of wildlife.

                <E T="03">Act</E> means the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 1027, 16 U.S.C. 1361-1407; Pub. L. 92-522.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Alaskan Native</E> means a person defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. section 1603(b) (85 Stat. 588)) as a citizen of the United States who is of one-fourth degree or more Alaska Indian (including Tsimshian Indians enrolled or not enrolled in the Metlaktla Indian Community), Eskimo, or Aleut blood, or combination thereof. The term includes any Native, as so defined, either or both of whose adoptive parents are not Natives. It also includes, in the absence of proof of a minimum blood quantum, any citizen of the United States who is regarded as an Alaska Native by the Native village or town of which he claims to be a member and whose father or mother is (or, if deceased, was) regarded as Native by any Native village or Native town. Any citizen enrolled by the Secretary pursuant to section 5 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act shall be conclusively presumed to be an Alaskan Native for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing</E> means items made by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo that (a) are composed wholly or in some significant respect of natural materials and (b) are significantly altered from their natural form and are produced, decorated, or fashioned in the exercise of traditional native handicrafts without the use of pantographs, multiple carvers, or similar mass-copying devices. Improved methods of production utilizing modern implements such as sewing machines or modern techniques at a tannery registered pursuant to § 18.23(c) may be used so long as no large-scale mass-production industry results. Traditional native handicrafts include, but are not limited to, weaving, carving, stitching, sewing, lacing, beading, drawing, and painting. The formation of traditional native groups, such as cooperatives, is permitted so long as no large-scale mass production results.<PRTPAGE P="7"/>

              <SUBJECT>Regulations governing small takes of marine mammals incidental to specified activities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose of regulations.</E> The regulations in this section implement Section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), which provides a mechanism for allowing, upon request, during periods of not more than five consecutive years each, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of regulations.</E> The taking of small numbers of marine mammals under section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act may be allowed only if the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service (1) finds, based on the best scientific evidence available, that the total taking during the specified time period will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock for subsistence uses; (2) prescribes regulations setting forth permissible methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance; and (3) prescribes regulations pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.

              <P>(iv) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the marine mammal populations and the likelihood of restoration of the affected habitat;</P>
              <P>(v) The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the habitat on the marine mammal population involved;</P>
              <P>(vi) The availability and feasibility (economic and technological) of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the affected species or stocks, their habitat, and, where relevant, on their availability for subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance. (The applicant and those conducting the specified activity and the affected subsistence users are encouraged to develop mutually agreeable mitigating measures that will meet the needs of subsistence users.);</P>
              <P>(vii) Suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring and reporting which will result in increased knowledge of the species through an analysis of the level of taking or impacts and suggested means of minimizing burdens by coordinating such reporting requirements with other schemes already applicable to persons conducting such activity; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating research opportunities, plans and activities relating to reducing such incidental taking from such specified activities, and evaluating its effects.</P>

              <P>(2) The Director shall determine the adequacy and completeness of a request, and if found to be adequate, will invite information, suggestions, and comments on the preliminary finding of negligible impact and on the proposed specific regulations through notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> newspapers of general circulation, and appropriate electronic media in the coastal areas that may be affected by such activity. All information and suggestions will be considered by the Fish and Wildlife Service in developing final findings and effective specific regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) The Director shall evaluate each request to determine, based on the best available scientific evidence, whether the total taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses. If the Director finds that mitigating measures would render the impact of the specified activity negligible when it would not otherwise satisfy that requirement, the Director may make a finding of negligible impact subject to such mitigating measures being successfully implemented. Any preliminary findings of “negligible impact” and “no unmitigable adverse impact” shall be proposed for public comment along with the proposed specific regulations.</P>

              <P>(4) If the Director cannot make a finding that the total taking will have a negligible impact in the species or stock or will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses, the Director shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the negative finding along with the basis for denying the request.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Specific regulations.</E> (1) Specific regulations will be established for each allowed activity which set forth (i) permissible methods of taking, (ii) means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses, and (iii) requirements for monitoring and reporting.</P>
              <P>(2) Regulations will be established based on the best available scientific information. As new information is developed, through monitoring, reporting, or research, the regulations may be modified, in whole or part, after notice and opportunity for public review.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Letters of Authorization.</E> (1) A Letter of Authorization, which may be issued only to U.S. citizens, is required to conduct activities pursuant to any specific regulations established. Requests for Letters of Authorization shall be submitted to the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department <PRTPAGE P="17"/>of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. The information to be submitted in a request may be obtained by writing the Director. Once specific regulations are effective, the Service will to the maximum extent possible, process subsequent applications for Letters of Authorization within 30 days after receipt of the application by the Service.</P>
              <P>(2) Issuance of a Letter of Authorization will be based on a determination that the level of taking will be consistent with the findings made for the total taking allowable under the specific regulations.</P>

              <P>(3) Notice of issuance of all Letters of Authorization will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 30 days of issuance.</P>
              <P>(4) Letters of Authorization will specify the period of validity and any additional terms and conditions appropriate for the specific request.</P>
              <P>(5) Letters of Authorization shall be withdrawn or suspended, either on an individual or class basis, as appropriate, if, after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Director determines: (i) The regulations prescribed are not being substantially complied with, or (ii) the taking allowed is having, or may have, more than a negligible impact on the species or stock, or where relevant, an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock for subsistence uses.</P>
              <P>(6) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in paragraph (f)(5) of this section shall not apply if the Director determines that an emergency exists which poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 18.34</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Guidelines for use in safely deterring polar bears.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) These guidelines are intended for use in safely deterring polar bears in the wild. They provide acceptable types of deterrence actions that any person, or their employee, or their agent, can use to deter a polar bear from damaging private property; or that any person can use to deter a polar bear from endangering personal safety; or that a government employee can use to deter a polar bear from damaging public property, and not cause the serious injury or death of a polar bear. Anyone acting in such a manner and conducting activities that comply with the guidelines in this subpart does not need authorization under the MMPA to conduct such deterrence. Furthermore, actions consistent with these guidelines do not violate the take prohibitions of the MMPA or this part. A Federal, State or local government official or employee may take a polar bear in the course of his duties as an official or employee, as long as such taking is accomplished in accordance with § 18.22 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) There are two types of deterrence measures that a person, or their employee, or their agent could follow to nonlethally deter a polar bear. Each type of measure includes a suite of appropriate actions that the public may use.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Passive deterrence measures.</E> Passive deterrence measures are those that prevent polar bears from gaining access to property or people. These measures provide for human safety and do not increase the risk of serious injury or death of a polar bear. They include:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Rigid fencing.</E> Rigid fencing and other fixed barriers such as gates and fence skirting can be used around buildings or areas to limit bears from accessing community or industrial sites and buildings. Fencing areas 5 acres (~2 ha) and smaller can be used to limit human-bear interactions. Industry standard chain-link fencing material can be used. Chain-link fencing can be placed around buildings on pilings as fence skirting to limit access of bears underneath the buildings.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Bear exclusion cages.</E> Bear exclusion cages provide a protective shelter for people in areas frequented by bears. Cages erected at building entry and exit points exclude polar bears from the immediate area and allow safe entry and exit for persons gaining access to, or leaving, a building should a polar bear be in the vicinity. Additionally, they provide an opportunity for people exiting a building to conduct a visual scan upon exit. Such a scan is especially important in areas where buildings are constructed above ground level due to permafrost because bears may be resting underneath. These cages can be used at homes or industrial facilities to deter bears as well. Cages can be used in remote areas where bear use is not known, and along bear travel corridors, e.g., within 0.5 mile from coastline, to deter bears from facilities. Cages must be no smaller than 4 ft (width) by 4 ft (length) by 8 ft (height). Bars must be no smaller than 1 inch wide. Distance between bars must be no more than 4 inches clear on stairways and landings or when otherwise attached to a habitable structure; they may be no more than 5 inches clear for use in cages not attached to any habitable structure. A 4-inch distance between the bars would be sufficient to prevent a bear from reaching through, while providing visible space between bars. The ceiling of the cage must be enclosed.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Bear-resistant garbage containers.</E> Bear-resistant garbage containers prevent bears from accessing garbage as a food source and limit polar bears from becoming food-conditioned or habituated to people and facilities. The absence of habituation further reduces the potential for bear-human interactions. Bear-resistant garbage cans and garbage bins are manufactured by various companies and in various sizes. Commercially designed residential <PRTPAGE P="24"/>bear-resistant containers (32-130 gallons) can be used. Two- to 6-cubic yard containers can be specifically designed by commercial vendors as bear-proof containers or have industry-standard lid locks to prohibit bear entry, depending on the need and location. For remote seasonal camps, garbage can be temporarily stored in steel drums secured with locking rings and a gasket, and removed from the site when transportation is available. Larger garbage containers, such as dumpsters or “roll-offs” (20 to 40 cubic yards), can limit bear-human interactions when the containers have bear-proof lids. Lids must be constructed of heavy steel tubing or similarly constructed with heavy expanded metal.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preventive deterrence measures.</E> Preventive deterrence measures are those that can dissuade a polar bear from initiating an interaction with property or people. These measures provide for safe human use and do not increase the risk of serious injury or death of a polar bear. These are:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Acoustic devices.</E> Acoustic deterrent devices may be used to create an auditory disturbance causing polar bears to move away from the affected area. The reasonable use of loud noises, e.g., vehicle engines, automobile sirens or horns, and air-horns, where such auditory stimuli could startle a bear and disrupt its approach to property or people, is authorized. This authorization is limited to deterrent devices with a sound strength of no greater than 140 dB SPL to be deployed for no more than a 30-second continuous time interval. The use of commercially available air horns or other audible products used as perimeter alarms, which create sounds that fall below this upper limit, is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Vehicle or boat deterrence.</E> Patrolling the periphery of a compound or encampment using a vehicle, such as a truck or all-terrain vehicle (e.g., a snowmobile or a four wheeler), and deterring, but not chasing, polar bears with engine noise, or by blocking their approach without making a physical contact with the animal, is an acceptable preventive deterrence. Similarly patrolling an area in a small boat using similar methods is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(c) The deterrence guidelines are passive or preventive in nature. Any action to deter polar bears that goes beyond these specific measures could result in a taking and, unless otherwise exempted under the MMPA, would require separate authorization. The Service acknowledges that there will be numerous new techniques developed, or new applications of existing techniques, for deterring bears. The Service will work to establish a system for evaluating new bear deterrence applications and techniques and will update this set of guidelines with examples of future approved methods. Deterrence actions (other than the measures described in these guidelines) that do not result in serious injury or death to a polar bear remain permissible for persons identified in section 101(a)(4)(A) of the MMPA. Prior to conducting activities beyond those specifically described in these guidelines, persons should contact the Service's Alaska Regional Office's Marine Mammal Program for further guidance (for the location of the Alaska Regional Office see 50 CFR 2.2(g)).</P>

              <P>(a) Sections 101(a)(2), 101(a)(3)(A), and 101(b) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2), 1371(a)(3)(A), and 1371(b)) and these regulations authorize the Director, U.S. <PRTPAGE P="25"/>Fish and Wildlife Service, to: (1) Impose regulations governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations; (2) waive the moratorium and adopt regulations with respect to the taking and importing of animals from each species of marine mammals under his jurisdiction; and (3) prescribe regulations governing the taking of depleted marine mammals by any Indian, Aleut or Eskimo, respectively. In prescribing regulations to carry out the provisions of said sections, the act refers the Director to section 103 (16 U.S.C. 1373). In accordance with section 103(d), regulations must be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing on such regulations and, in the case of a waiver, on the determination by the Director to waive the moratorium pursuant to section 101(a)(3)(A) (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(3)(A)).</P>

              <P>Regulations in this subpart apply to the nonlethal incidental, but not intentional, take of small numbers of polar bear and Pacific walrus by U.S. citizens while engaged in oil and gas exploration, development, production, and/or other substantially similar activities in the Beaufort Sea and adjacent northern coast of Alaska. “U.S. citizens” is defined in 50 CFR 18.27(c). The term “small numbers” is also defined in 50 CFR 18.27(c), however, we do not rely on that definition here as it conflates “small numbers” with “negligible impacts.” Regulations in this subpart rely on a small numbers determination where we estimated the likely number of takes of polar bears and Pacific walruses during the specified activities, and evaluated if that take is small relative to the size of the population or stock.</P>

              <P>(a) An applicant must be a U.S. citizen as defined in § 18.27(c).</P>

              <P>(b) If an applicant proposes to conduct oil and gas industry exploration, development, production, and/or other substantially similar activity in the Beaufort Sea ITR region described in § 18.122 that may cause the taking of Pacific walruses and/or polar bears and wants nonlethal incidental take authorization under the regulations in this subpart J, the applicant must apply for an LOA. The applicant must submit the request for authorization to the Service's Alaska Region Marine Mammals Management Office (see § 2.2 for address) at least 90 days prior to the start of the activity.<PRTPAGE P="33"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) The request for an LOA must include the following information and must comply with the requirements set forth in § 18.128:</P>

              <P>(1) A plan of operations that describes in detail the activity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> type of project, methods, and types and numbers of equipment and personnel, etc.), the dates and duration of the activity, and the specific locations of and areas affected by the activity.</P>
              <P>(2) A site-specific marine mammal monitoring and mitigation plan to monitor and mitigate the effects of the activity on Pacific walruses and polar bears.</P>
              <P>(3) A site-specific Pacific walrus and polar bear safety, awareness, and interaction plan. The plan for each activity and location will detail the policies and procedures that will provide for the safety and awareness of personnel, avoid interactions with Pacific walruses and polar bears, and minimize impacts to these animals.</P>

              <P>(4) A Plan of Cooperation (POC) to mitigate potential conflicts between the activity and subsistence hunting, where relevant. Applicants must provide documentation of communication with potentially affected subsistence communities along the Beaufort Sea coast (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Kaktovik, Nuiqsut, and Barrow) and appropriate subsistence user organizations (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the Eskimo Walrus Commission or North Slope Borough) to discuss the location, timing, and methods of activities and identify and mitigate any potential conflicts with subsistence walrus and polar bear hunting activities. Applicants must specifically inquire of relevant communities and organizations if the activity will interfere with the availability of Pacific walruses and/or polar bears for the subsistence use of those groups. Applications for Letters of Authorization must include documentation of all consultations with potentially affected user groups. Documentation must include a summary of any concerns identified by community members and hunter organizations, and the applicant's responses to identified concerns.</P>

              <P>(a) We will evaluate each request for an LOA based on the specific activity and the specific geographic location. We will determine whether the level of activity identified in the request exceeds that analyzed by us in considering the number of animals likely to be taken and evaluating whether there will be a negligible impact on the species or an adverse impact on the availability of the species for subsistence uses. If the level of activity is greater, we will reevaluate our findings to determine if those findings continue to be appropriate based on the greater level of activity that the applicant has requested. Depending on the results of the evaluation, we may grant the authorization, add further conditions, or deny the authorization.</P>
              <P>(b) In accordance with § 18.27(f)(5), we will make decisions concerning withdrawals of an LOA, either on an individual or class basis, only after notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>
              <P>(c) The requirement for notice and public comment in paragraph (b) of this section will not apply should we determine that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of polar bears or Pacific walruses.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for all Letters of Authorization (LOAs).</E> Holders of an LOA must implement policies and procedures to conduct activities in a manner that minimizes to the greatest extent practicable adverse impacts on Pacific walruses and/or polar bears, their habitat, and the availability of these marine mammals for subsistence uses. Adaptive management practices, such as temporal or spatial activity restrictions in response to the presence of marine mammals in a particular place or time or the occurrence of Pacific walruses and/or polar bears engaged in a biologically significant activity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> resting, feeding, denning, or nursing, among others) must be used to avoid interactions with and minimize impacts to these animals and their availability for subsistence uses.</P>
              <P>(1) All holders of an LOA must:</P>
              <P>(i) Cooperate with the Service's Marine Mammals Management Office and other designated Federal, State, and local agencies to monitor and mitigate the impacts of oil and gas industry activities on Pacific walruses and polar bears.</P>
              <P>(ii) Designate trained and qualified personnel to monitor for the presence of Pacific walruses and polar bears, initiate mitigation measures, and monitor, record, and report the effects of oil and gas industry activities on Pacific walruses and/or polar bears.</P>
              <P>(iii) Have an approved Pacific walrus and polar bear safety, awareness, and interaction plan on file with the Service's Marine Mammals Management Office and onsite, and provide polar bear awareness training to certain personnel. Interaction plans must include:</P>

              <P>(A) The type of activity and where and when the activity will occur (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a summary of the plan of operation);</P>
              <P>(B) A food, waste, and other “bear attractants” management plan;</P>

              <P>(2) All applicants for an LOA must contact affected subsistence communities and hunter organizations to discuss potential conflicts caused by the activities and provide the Service documentation of communications as described in § 18.124.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for onshore activities.</E> Holders of an LOA must undertake the following activities to limit disturbance around known polar bear dens:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Attempt to locate polar bear dens.</E> Holders of an LOA seeking to carry out onshore activities in known or suspected polar bear denning habitat during the denning season (November-April) must make efforts to locate occupied polar bear dens within and near areas of operation, utilizing appropriate tools, such as forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imagery and/or polar bear scent-trained dogs. All observed or suspected polar bear dens must be reported to the Service prior to the initiation of activities.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Observe the exclusion zone around known polar bear dens.</E> Operators must observe a 1.6-km (1-mi) operational exclusion zone around all known polar bear dens during the denning season (November-April, or until the female and cubs leave the areas). Should previously unknown occupied dens be discovered within 1 mi of activities, work must cease and the Service contacted for guidance. The Service will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate action. Potential actions may range from cessation or modification of work to conducting additional monitoring, and the holder of the authorization must comply with any additional measures specified.<PRTPAGE P="35"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Use the den habitat map developed by the USGS.</E> A map of potential coastal polar bear denning habitat can be found at: <E T="03">http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/biology/polar_bears/denning.html.</E> This measure ensures that the location of potential polar bear dens is considered when conducting activities in the coastal areas of the Beaufort Sea.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Polar bear den restrictions.</E> Restrict the timing of the activity to limit disturbance around dens.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for operational and support vessels.</E> (1) Operational and support vessels must be staffed with dedicated marine mammal observers to alert crew of the presence of walruses and polar bears and initiate adaptive mitigation responses.</P>
              <P>(2) At all times, vessels must maintain the maximum distance possible from concentrations of walruses or polar bears. Under no circumstances, other than an emergency, should any vessel approach within an 805-m (0.5-mi) radius of walruses or polar bears observed on land or ice.</P>
              <P>(3) Vessel operators must take every precaution to avoid harassment of concentrations of feeding walruses when a vessel is operating near these animals. Vessels should reduce speed and maintain a minimum 805-m (0.5-mi) operational exclusion zone around feeding walrus groups. Vessels may not be operated in such a way as to separate members of a group of walruses from other members of the group. When weather conditions require, such as when visibility drops, vessels should adjust speed accordingly to avoid the likelihood of injury to walruses.</P>
              <P>(4) Vessels bound for the Beaufort Sea ITR Region may not transit through the Chukchi Sea prior to July 1. This operating condition is intended to allow walruses the opportunity to move through the Bering Strait and disperse from the confines of the spring lead system into the Chukchi Sea with minimal disturbance. It is also intended to minimize vessel impacts upon the availability of walruses for Alaska Native subsistence hunters. Exemption waivers to this operating condition may be issued by the Service on a case-by-case basis, based upon a review of seasonal ice conditions and available information on walrus and polar bear distributions in the area of interest.</P>
              <P>(5) All vessels must avoid areas of active or anticipated walrus or polar bear subsistence hunting activity as determined through community consultations.</P>
              <P>(6) In association with marine activities, we may require trained marine mammal monitors on the site of the activity or on board drill ships, drill rigs, aircraft, icebreakers, or other support vessels or vehicles to monitor the impacts of Industry's activity on polar bear and Pacific walruses.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for aircraft.</E> (1) Operators of support aircraft should, at all times, conduct their activities at the maximum distance possible from concentrations of walruses or polar bears.</P>
              <P>(2) Under no circumstances, other than an emergency, should aircraft operate at an altitude lower than 457 m (1,500 ft) within 805 m (0.5 mi) of walruses or polar bears observed on ice or land. Helicopters may not hover or circle above such areas or within 805 m (0.5 mile) of such areas. When weather conditions do not allow a 457-m (1,500-ft) flying altitude, such as during severe storms or when cloud cover is low, aircraft may be operated below this altitude. However, when weather conditions necessitate operation of aircraft at altitudes below 457 m (1,500 ft), the operator must avoid areas of known walrus and polar bear concentrations and should take precautions to avoid flying directly over or within 805 m (0.5 mile) of these areas.</P>
              <P>(3) Plan all aircraft routes to minimize any potential conflict with active or anticipated walrus or polar bear hunting activity as determined through community consultations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for sound-producing offshore activities.</E> Any offshore activity expected to produce pulsed underwater sounds with received sound levels ≥160 dB re 1 µPa will be required to establish and monitor acoustically verified mitigation zones surrounding the sound source and implement adaptive mitigation measures as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Mitigation zones.</E> (i) A walrus monitoring zone is required where the received pulsed sound level would be ≥160 <PRTPAGE P="36"/>dB re 1 µPa. Walruses in this zone are assumed to experience Level B take.</P>
              <P>(ii) A walrus mitigation zone is required where the received pulsed sound level would be ≥180 dB re 1 µPa.</P>
              <P>(iii) A walrus or polar bear mitigation zone is required where the received pulsed sound level would be ≥190 dB re 1 µPa.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Ramp-up procedures.</E> For all sound sources, including sound source testing, the following sound ramp-up procedures must be used to allow walruses and polar bears to depart the mitigation zones:</P>

              <P>(A) Visually monitor the ≥180 dB re 1 µPa and ≥190 dB re 1 µPa mitigation zones and adjacent waters for walruses and polar bears for at least 30 minutes before initiating ramp-up procedures. If no walruses or polar bears are detected, ramp-up procedures may begin. Do not initiate ramp-up procedures when mitigation zones are not observable (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> at night, in fog, during storms or high sea states, etc.).</P>
              <P>(B) Initiate ramp-up procedures by activating a single, or least powerful, sound source, in terms of energy output and/or volume capacity.</P>
              <P>(C) Continue ramp-up by gradually increasing sound output over a period of at least 20 minutes, but no longer than 40 minutes, until the desired operating level of the sound source is obtained.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Power down.</E> Immediately power down a sound source when:</P>
              <P>(A) One or more walruses is observed or detected within the area delineated by the pulsed sound ≥180 dB re 1 µPa walrus mitigation zone; and</P>
              <P>(B) One or more walruses or polar bears are observed or detected within the area delineated by the pulsed sound ≥190 dB re 1 µPa walrus or polar bear mitigation zone.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Shut down.</E> (A) If the power down operation cannot reduce the received pulsed sound level to &lt;180 dB re 1 µPa (walrus) or &lt;190 dB re 1 µPa (walrus or polar bear), the operator must immediately shut down the sound source.</P>
              <P>(B) If observations are made or credible reports are received that one or more walruses or polar bears within the area of the sound source activity are believed to be in an injured or mortal state, or are indicating acute distress due to received sound, the sound source must be immediately shut down and the Service contacted. The sound source will not be restarted until review and approval has been given by the Service. The ramp-up procedures must be followed when restarting.</P>

                  <SU>1</SU> Based on acoustic criteria for otariid pinnipeds from the National Marine Fisheries Service. Sound source types are separated into impulsive (e.g., seismic, pipe driving, sub-bottom profiler) and non-impulsive (drilling, water jet) and require estimation of the distance to the peak received sound pressure level (peak) and 24-hr cumulative sound exposure level (SEL<E T="0732">CUM</E>).</TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> Designate trained and qualified PSOs or “observers” to monitor for the presence of sea otters in mitigation zones, initiate mitigation measures, and record and report the effects of project work on otters for all noise-generating work.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for sea otters in mitigation zones.</E> The following actions will be taken in response to otters in mitigation zones:</P>
              <P>(i) Sea otters that are under no visible distress within the SZ must be monitored continuously. Power down, shut down, or maneuver away from the sea otter if practicable to reduce sound received by the animal. Maintain 100-m (301-ft) separation distance whenever possible. Exposures in this zone are counted as one Level B take per animal per day.</P>
              <P>(ii) When sea otters are observed within or approaching the EZ, noise-generating work as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be immediately shut down or powered down to reduce the size of the zone sufficiently to exclude the animal from the zone. Vessel speed or course may be altered to achieve the same task. Exposures in this zone are counted as one Level A take per animal per day.</P>
              <P>(iii) When sea otters are observed in visible distress (for example, vocalizing, repeatedly spy-hopping, or fleeing), noise-generating work as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be immediately shut down or powered down to reduce the size of the zone sufficiently to exclude the animal from the zone.</P>
              <P>(iv) Following a shutdown, the noise-generating activity will not resume until the sea otter has cleared the EZ. The animal will be considered to have cleared the EZ if it is visually observed to have left the EZ or has not been seen within the EZ for 30 minutes or longer.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Ramp-up procedures.</E> Prior to noise-generating work, a “ramp-up” procedure must be used to increase the levels of underwater sound from noise-generating work at a gradual rate.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Seismic surveys:</E> A ramp-up will be used at the initial start of airgun operations and prior to restarting after any period greater than 10 minutes without airgun operations, including a power-down or shutdown event (described in paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section). During geophysical work, the number and total volume of airguns will be increased incrementally until the full volume is achieved. The rate of ramp-up will be no more than 6 dB per 5-minute period. Ramp-up will begin with the smallest gun in the array that is being used for all airgun array configurations. During the ramp-up, the <PRTPAGE P="43"/>applicable mitigation zones (based on type of airgun and sound levels produced) must be maintained. It will not be permissible to ramp up the full array from a complete shutdown in thick fog or at other times when the outer part of the EZ is not visible. Ramp-up of the airguns will not be initiated if a sea otter is sighted within the EZ at any time.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Pile/pipe driving:</E> A ramp-up of the hammering will precede each day's pipe/pile driving activities or if pipe/pile driving has ceased for more than 1 hour. The EZ will be determined clear of sea otters 30 minutes prior to a ramp-up to ensure no sea otters are within or entering the EZ. Initial hammering starts will not begin during periods of poor visibility (e.g., night, fog, wind) when the entire EZ is not visible. The ramp-up procedure for impact hammers involves initially starting with three soft strikes at 40 percent energy, followed by a 1-minute waiting period followed by two subsequent three-strike sets. For vibratory hammers, initial noise generation will be limited to 15 seconds at a reduced energy level, followed by a 1-minute waiting period. This cycle will be repeated two additional times. Monitoring will occur during all hammering sessions.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">All activities:</E> Any shutdown due to sea otters sighted within the EZ must be followed by a 30-minute all-clear period and then a standard full ramp-up. Any shutdown for other reasons resulting in the cessation of the sound source for a period greater than 30 minutes must also be followed by full ramp-up procedures. If otters are observed during a ramp-up effort or prior to startup, a PSO must record the observation and monitor the animal's position until it moves out of visual range. Noise-generating work may commence if, after a full and gradual effort to ramp up the underwater sound level, the otter is outside of the EZ and does not show signs of visible distress (for example, vocalizing, repeatedly spy-hopping, or fleeing).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Startup procedures.</E> (i) Visual monitoring must begin at least 30 minutes prior to, and continue throughout, ramp-up efforts.</P>
              <P>(ii) Visual monitoring must continue during all noise-generating work occurring in daylight hours.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Power-down procedures.</E> A power-down procedure involves reducing the volume of underwater sound generated to prevent an otter from entering the EZ.</P>
              <P>(i) Whenever a sea otter is detected outside the EZ and, based on its position and motion relative to the noise-generating work, appears likely to enter the EZ but has not yet done so, operators may reduce power to noise-generating equipment as an alternative to a shutdown.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever a sea otter is detected in the SZ, an operator may power down when practicable to reduce Level B take.</P>
              <P>(iii) During a power-down of seismic work, the number of airguns in use may be reduced, such that the EZ is reduced, making the sea otters unlikely to enter the EZ. A mitigation airgun (airgun of small volume such as the 10-in<SU>3</SU> gun) will be operated continuously during a power-down of seismic work.</P>
              <P>(iv) After a power-down, noise-generating work will not resume until the sea otter has cleared the applicable EZ. The animal will be considered to have cleared the applicable zone if it is visually observed to have left the EZ and has not been seen within the zone for 30 minutes.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Shutdown procedure.</E> A shutdown occurs when all noise-generating work is suspended.</P>
              <P>(i) Noise-generating work will be shut down completely if a sea otter enters the EZ.</P>
              <P>(ii) The shutdown procedure will be accomplished within several seconds of the determination that a sea otter is either in or about to enter the EZ or as soon as practicable considering worker safety and equipment integrity.</P>
              <P>(iii) Noise-generating work will not proceed until all sea otters have cleared the EZ and the PSOs on duty are confident that no sea otters remain within the EZ. An otter will be considered to have cleared the EZ if it is visually observed to have left the EZ or has not been seen within the zone for 30 minutes.</P>

              <P>(iv) Visual monitoring must continue for 30 minutes after use of the acoustic <PRTPAGE P="44"/>source ceases or the sun sets, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Emergency shutdown.</E> If observations are made or credible reports are received that one or more sea otters are within the area of noise-generating work and are indicating acute distress associated with the work, such as any injury due to seismic noise or persistent vocalizations indicating separation of mother from pup, the work will be immediately shut down and the Service contacted. Work will not be restarted until review and approval by the Service.</P>
              <P>(9) To ensure the proposed activities remain consistent with the estimated take of sea otters, operators may not conduct 3D seismic surveys where doing so will generate underwater noise levels that are likely to exceed acoustic exposure thresholds within areas of estimated sea otter densities greater than 0.026 otters per km. Maps of the areas will be provided to 3D seismic operators and may be adjusted based on SSV results. This does not apply to 2D seismic surveys.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mitigation for all in-water construction and demolition activity.</E> (1) The applicant must implement a minimum EZ of a 10-m radius around the in-water construction and demolition. If a sea otter comes within or approaches the EZ, such operations must cease. A larger EZ may be required for some activities, such as blasting, and will be specified in the LOA.</P>
              <P>(2) All work in intertidal areas shall be conducted during low tide when the site is dewatered to the maximum extent practicable.</P>
              <P>(3) The applicant must evaluate alternatives to pile-supported facilities. If no practicable alternative exists, the applicant must then evaluate the use of sound-attenuation devices such as pile caps and cushions, bubble curtains, and dewatered cofferdams during construction. The Service may require sound-attenuation devices or alternatives to pile-supported designs.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Measures for vessel-based activities.</E> (1) Vessel operators must take every precaution to avoid harassment of sea otters when a vessel is operating near these animals.</P>
              <P>(2) Vessels must remain at least 500 m from rafts of otters unless safety is a factor.</P>
              <P>(3) Vessels must reduce speed and maintain a distance of 100 m (328 ft) from all sea otters unless safety is a factor.</P>
              <P>(4) Vessels must not be operated in such a way as to separate members of a group of sea otters from other members of the group.</P>
              <P>(5) When weather conditions require, such as when visibility drops, vessels must adjust speed accordingly to avoid the likelihood of injury to sea otters.</P>
              <P>(6) Vessels in transit and support vessels must use established navigation channels or commonly recognized vessel traffic corridors, and must avoid alongshore travel in shallow water (&lt;20 m) whenever practicable.</P>
              <P>(7) All vessels must avoid areas of active or anticipated subsistence hunting for sea otters as determined through community consultations.</P>
              <P>(8) Vessel operators must be provided written guidance for avoiding collisions and minimizing disturbances to sea otters. Guidance will include measures identified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Mitigation measures for aircraft activities.</E> (1) Aircraft must maintain a minimum altitude of 305 m (1,000 ft) to avoid unnecessary harassment of sea otters, except during takeoff and landing, and when a lower flight altitude is necessary for safety due to weather or restricted visibility.</P>
              <P>(2) Aircraft must not be operated in such a way as to separate members of a group of sea otters from other members of the group.</P>
              <P>(3) All aircraft must avoid areas of active or anticipated subsistence hunting for sea otters as determined through community consultations.</P>
              <P>(4) Unmanned aerial systems or drones must not cause take by harassment of sea otters. Measures for avoidance of take may be required in an LOA, and may include maintaining a minimum altitude and horizontal distance no less than 100 m away from otters, conducting continuous visual monitoring by PSOs, and ceasing activities in response to sea otter behaviors indicating any reaction to drones.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Information collection requirements.</E> The collections of information contained in § 20.20 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and assigned clearance number 1018-0015. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information will be used to provide a sampling frame for the national Migratory Bird Harvest Survey. Response is required from licensed hunters to obtain the benefit of hunting migratory game birds. Public reporting burden for this information is estimated to average 2 minutes per response for 3,300,000 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Thus the total annual reporting and record-keeping burden for this collection is estimated to be 112,000 hours. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> Each person hunting migratory game birds in any State except Hawaii must have identified himself or herself as a migratory bird hunter and given his or her name, address, and date of birth to the respective State hunting licensing authority and must have on his or her person evidence, provided by that State, of compliance with this requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tribal exemptions.</E> Nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to tribal members on Federal Indian Reservations or to tribal members hunting on ceded lands.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">State exemptions.</E> Nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to those hunters who are exempt from State-licensing requirements in the State in which they are hunting.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">State responsibilities.</E> The State hunting licensing authority will ask each licensed migratory bird hunter in the respective State to report approximately how many ducks, geese, doves, and woodcock he or she bagged the previous year, whether he or she hunted coots, snipe, rails, and/or gallinules the previous year, and, in States that have band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons, whether he or she intends to hunt band-tailed pigeons during the current year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The taking, possession, transportation, and other uses of migratory game birds by hunters is generally prohibited unless it is specifically provided for under regulations developed in accordance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Consequently, hunting is prohibited unless regulatory schedules are established for seasons, daily bag and possession limits, and shooting (or hawking) hours. Migratory game bird population levels, including production and habitat conditions, vary annually. These conditions differ over North America, and within the United States, by flyways, States, and frequently areas within States. Thus, it is necessary to make annual adjustments in the schedules to limit the harvests of migratory game birds to permissible levels.</P>
              <P>(b) The development of these schedules involves annual data gathering programs to determine migratory game bird population status and trends, evaluations of habitat conditions, harvest information, and other factors having a bearing on the anticipated size of the fall flights of these birds. The proposed hunting schedules are announced early in the spring, and following consideration of additional information as it becomes available, as well as public comment, they are modified and published as supplemental proposals. These are also open to public comment. Public hearings are held for the purpose of providing additional opportunity for public participation in the rulemaking process.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">In vitro evaluation.</E> You must evaluate the candidate shot type or shot coating in a standardized test under conditions that will assess its erosion and any release of components into a liquid medium in an environment simulating the conditions of a waterfowl gizzard (see W.H. Kimball and Z.A. Munir, 1971, The corrosion of lead shot in a simulated waterfowl gizzard, Journal of Wildlife Management 35:360-365) for basic test procedures. Compare the erosion characteristics to those of lead shot and steel shot of comparable size.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Test materials.</E> You will need appropriate analysis equipment, such as for atomic absorption spectrophotometry or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, a drilled aluminum block to support test tubes, a thermostatically controlled stirring hot plate, small Teflon®-coated magnets, hydrochloric acid of pH 2.0, pepsin, capped test tubes, and U.S. No. 4 lead, steel, and candidate shot type or shot with the proposed coating.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedures.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Add hydrochloric acid and pepsin to each capped test tube at a volume and concentration that will erode a single U.S. No. 4 lead shot at the rate of 5 mg per day.</P>
              <P>(ii) Place three test tubes, each containing lead shot, steel shot, or the candidate shot type or shot with the proposed coating in an aluminum block on the stirring hot plate. Add a Teflon®-coated magnet to each test tube and set the hot plate at 42 degrees Centigrade and 500 revolutions per minute.</P>
              <P>(iii) Determine the erosion of shot or shot with the proposed coating daily for 14 consecutive days by weighing the shot and analyzing the digestion solution with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.</P>
              <P>(iv) Replicate the 14-day procedure five times.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test analyses.</E> Compare erosion rates of the three types of shot by appropriate analysis of variance and regression procedures. The statistical analyses will determine whether the rate of erosion of the shot and/or shot coating is significantly greater or less than that of lead and/or steel shot. This determination is important to any subsequent toxicity testing.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) After a 3-week acclimation period in which the ducks are fed with commercial maintenance mash, provide them an unrestricted diet of corn for 60 days and then pair them, put one pair in each pen, and provide them with commercial breeder mash.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) After the acclimation period, dose each bird in the lead group with 1 pellet of U.S. No. 4 lead shot, each bird in one of the groups of 20 males and 20 females with 8 pellets of U.S. No. 4 steel shot, and each bird in the remaining group of 20 males and 20 females with 8 pellets of U.S. No. 4 candidate shot type or shot with the proposed coating.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Redose each bird with the appropriate shot after 30, 60, and 90 days. Few, if any, of the lead-dosed birds should survive and reproduce.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Fluoroscope each bird 1 week after dosing it to check for shot retention.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Weigh each bird the day of initial dosing (day 0), at each subsequent dosing, and at death.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Collect a blood sample from each bird on the days on which it is dosed and immediately prior to euthanizing it.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Check nests daily and collect any eggs laid. Note the date of first egg laid and the mean number of days per egg laid. Conclude monitoring of laying after 21 normal, uncracked eggs are laid or after 150 days.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Collect eggs and discard any eggs laid before pairing.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">10</E>) Euthanize the adults after they complete laying or after 150 days.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">11</E>) Remove the liver and other appropriate organs from each euthanized bird and from each bird that dies prior to being euthanized.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">12</E>) Analyze the organs and the eleventh egg for compounds contained in the shot or shot coating.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">13</E>) Necropsy all the birds to determine any gross and/or microscopic pathological conditions that affected them.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">14</E>) Artificially incubate the normal eggs and calculate the percent shell thickness for each (compared to typical shell thickness), the percent of eggs cracked, the percent fertility (as determined by candling), and the percentage of fertile eggs hatched for each female.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">15</E>) Provide ducklings that hatch with starter mash. Euthanize all ducklings at 14 days of age.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">16</E>) Determine survival to day 14 and weight of the ducklings at hatching and at being euthanized.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">17</E>) Measure duckling blood for hemoglobin concentration and other blood chemistries using blood samples drawn when the ducklings are euthanized.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Test analyses.</E> Any mortality, reproductive inhibition, or effects on physiological parameters due to the shot or shot coating must not be significantly greater than those caused by steel shot. If necessary, transform percentage data with an arcsine, square root, or other suitable transformation prior to statistical analyses. Analyze the physiological and reproductive <PRTPAGE P="69"/>data with one-tailed <E T="03">t</E>-tests or other appropriate statistical procedures with <E T="03">α</E> = 0.05, and <E T="03">β</E> = 0.8.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Evaluation of Tier 3 testing.</E> Report the results of your Tier 3 testing to us. We will review the data within 60 days of the day on which we receive your Tier 3 application materials. You must ensure that copies of the raw data and the statistical analyses accompany the laboratory reports and final comprehensive report on this test.</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Approval after Tier 3 testing.</E> If we determine that the Tier 3 test data show that the shot or shot coating does not pose a significant toxicity danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats, we will notify you and request payment of a $20,000 final review and publication fee (payable to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).</P>

              <P>(1) After receipt of payment, we will publish a proposed rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> stating that we intend to approve this shot or shot coating and provide the public with the opportunity to comment. The proposed rule will include a description of the chemical composition of the shot or shot coating and a synopsis of findings under the standards required by Tier 3.</P>

              <P>(2) If, at the end of the comment period, we conclude that the shot or shot coating does not pose a significant toxicity danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats, we will approve the shot or coating as nontoxic with publication of a final rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and subsequent addition of the shot or coating to the list in § 20.21(j).</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Additional testing after Tier 3.</E> If we conclude that the Tier 3 data are inconclusive, or if we conclude that the shot or shot coating may pose a significant toxicity danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats, we may ask you to repeat tests we deem inconclusive. If you choose not to repeat the tests, we will deny approval of the candidate shot type or shot coating.</P>
              <P>(y) <E T="03">Denial after Tier 3 testing.</E> If we conclude that the shot or shot coating may pose a significant toxicity danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats, we will notify you that we deny approval of the candidate shot type or shot coating.</P>
              <P>(z) <E T="03">Withdrawal of the approval of a shot type or shot coating.</E> If we find that an approved shot type or shot coating is not readily detectable in the field or has environmental effects or direct toxicological effects on biota, we may withdraw our approval of the shot type or shot coating. This includes any previously approved shot type or shot coating.</P>
              <P>(1) We may consult the Service Law Enforcement Laboratory to determine whether any particular shot type or shot coating is readily detectable in the field by law enforcement officers. If the shot type is not readily detectable in the field, we will give the shotshell producer 180 days to remedy the situation by improving either the shot or the detection method.</P>
              <P>(2) We may consider new evidence, consistent with the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. 106-554, 2001; Office of Management and Budget Guidance, 67 FR 8452-8460, February 22, 2002) that shows that an approved shot type or shot coating has significant environmental effects or direct toxicological effects that were not known when we approved the shot type or shot coating.</P>

              <P>(3) After the 180-day period for a shot type that cannot be tested in the field (see paragraph (z)(1) of this section), or at any time after we learn of significant environmental effects or direct toxicological effects, we will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> informing manufacturers and the public of our pending withdrawal of the approval of the shot type or shot coating. We will revise the table of approved shot types at § 20.21(j) to reflect the withdrawal of the approval, to be effective on January 1st, after allowing manufacturers 1 full calendar year to prepare for the change.</P>

              </P>

              <P>(b)(1) State game departments, municipal game farms or parks, and public museums, public zoological parks, accredited institutional members of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) and public scientific or educational institutions may acquire by gift or purchase, possess, transport, and by gift or sale dispose of lawfully acquired migratory birds or their progeny, parts, nests, or eggs without a permit: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such birds may be acquired only from persons authorized by this paragraph or by a permit issued pursuant to this part to possess and dispose of such <PRTPAGE P="74"/>birds, or from Federal or State game authorities by the gift of seized, condemned, r sick or injured birds. Any such birds, acquired without a permit, and any progeny therefrom may be disposed of only to persons authorized by this paragraph to acquire such birds without a permit. Any person exercising a privilege granted by this paragraph must keep accurate records of such operations showing the species and number of birds acquired, possessed, and disposed of; the names and addresses of the persons from whom such birds were acquired or to whom such birds were donated or sold; and the dates of such transactions. Records shall be maintained or reproducible in English on a calendar year basis and shall be retained for a period of five (5) years following the end of the calendar year covered by the records.</P>

Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the take of uninjured or healthy birds without prior authorization from the Service. Additionally, nothing in this paragraph authorizes the taking, collection, or possession of migratory birds when circumstances indicate reasonable probability that death, injury, or disability was caused by factors other than infectious disease and/or natural toxins. These factors may include, but are not limited to, oil or chemical contamination, electrocution, shooting, or pesticides. If the cause of death of a bird is determined to be other than natural causes or disease, Service law enforcement officials must be contacted without delay.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Licensed veterinarians:</E> Licensed veterinarians are not required to obtain a Federal migratory bird permit to temporarily possess, stabilize, or euthanize sick and injured migratory birds. However, a veterinarian without a migratory bird rehabilitation permit must transfer any such bird to a federally permitted migratory bird rehabilitator within 24 hours after the bird's condition is stabilized, unless the bird is euthanized. If a veterinarian is unable to locate a permitted rehabilitator within that time, the veterinarian must contact his or her Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office for assistance in locating a permitted migratory bird rehabilitator and/or to obtain authorization to continue to hold the bird. In addition, veterinarians must:</P>

              <P>(1) Notify the local U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Ecological Services Office immediately upon receiving a threatened or endangered migratory bird species. Contact information for Ecological Services offices can be located on the Internet at <E T="03">http://offices.fws.gov</E>;</P>
              <P>(2) Euthanize migratory birds as required by § 21.31(e)(4)(iii) and § 21.31(e)(4)(iv), and dispose of dead migratory birds in accordance with § 21.31(e)(4)(vi); and</P>
              <P>(3) Keep records for 5 years of all migratory birds that die while in their care, including those they euthanize. The records must include: the species of bird, the type of injury, the date of acquisition, the date of death, and whether the bird was euthanized.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">General public:</E> Any person may remove a migratory bird from the interior of a building or structure under certain conditions.</P>
              <P>(1) You may humanely remove a trapped migratory bird from the interior of a residence or a commercial or government building without a Federal permit if the migratory bird:</P>
              <P>(i) Poses a health threat (for example, through damage to foodstuffs);</P>
              <P>(ii) Is attacking humans, or poses a threat to human safety because of its activities (such as opening and closing automatic doors);</P>
              <P>(iii) Poses a threat to commercial interests, such as through damage to products for sale; or</P>
              <P>(iv) May injure itself because it is trapped.</P>

              <P>(2) You must use a humane method to capture the bird or birds. You may not use adhesive traps to which birds may adhere (such as glue traps) or any other method of capture likely to harm the bird.<PRTPAGE P="75"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Unless you have a permit that allows you to conduct abatement activities with a raptor, you may not release a raptor into a building to either frighten or capture another bird.</P>
              <P>(4) You must immediately release a captured bird to the wild in habitat suitable for the species, unless it is exhausted, ill, injured, or orphaned.</P>
              <P>(5) If a bird is exhausted or ill, or is injured or orphaned during the removal, the property owner is responsible for immediately transferring it to a federally permitted migratory bird rehabilitator.</P>
              <P>(6) You may not lethally take a migratory bird for these purposes. If your actions to remove the trapped migratory bird are likely to result in its lethal take, you must possess a Federal Migratory Bird Permit. However, if a bird you are trying to remove dies, you must dispose of the carcass immediately unless you have reason to believe that a museum or scientific institution might be able to use it. In that case, you should contact your nearest Fish and Wildlife Service office or your State wildlife agency about donating the carcass.</P>
              <P>(7) For birds of species on the Federal List of Threatened or Endangered Wildlife, provided at 50 CFR 17.11(h), you may need a Federal threatened or endangered species permit before removing the birds (see 50 CFR 17.21 and 50 CFR 17.31).</P>
              <P>(8) You must have a permit from your Regional migratory bird permits office to remove a bald eagle or a golden eagle from a building (see 50 CFR Part 22).</P>
              <P>(9) Your action must comply with State and local regulations and ordinances. You may need a State, Tribal, or Territorial permit before you can legally remove the bird or birds.</P>
              <P>(10) If an active nest with eggs or nestlings is present, you must seek the assistance of a federally permitted migratory bird rehabilitator in removing the eggs or nestlings. The rehabilitator is then responsible for handling them properly.</P>
              <P>(11) If you need advice on dealing with a trapped bird, you should contact your closest Fish and Wildlife Service office or your State wildlife agency.</P>

Any such notice will include the basis for the Secretary's determination that withdrawal is warranted in accordance with the criteria contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and will identify any conservation measures or other measures that would, if implemented by the Armed Forces, permit the Secretary to cancel the proposed withdrawal of authorization.</P>

              <P>(4) Within 15 days of receipt of the notice specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary of Defense may notify the Secretary in writing of the Armed Forces' objections, if any, to the proposed withdrawal, specifying the reasons therefore. The Secretary will give due consideration to any objections raised by the Armed Forces. If the Secretary continues to believe that <PRTPAGE P="78"/>withdrawal is appropriate, he or she will provide written notice to the Secretary of Defense of the rationale for withdrawal and response to any objections to the withdrawal. If objections to the withdrawal remain, the withdrawal will not become effective until the Secretary of Defense has had the opportunity to meet with the Secretary within 30 days of the original notice from the Secretary proposing withdrawal. A final determination regarding whether authorization will be withdrawn will occur within 45 days of the original notice.</P>
              <P>(5) Any authorized take incidental to a military readiness activity subject to a proposed withdrawal of authorization will continue to be authorized by this regulation until the Secretary makes a final determination on the withdrawal.</P>
              <P>(6) The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, cancel a suspension or withdrawal of authorization at any time. A suspension may be cancelled in the event new information is provided that the proposed activity would be compatible with the migratory bird treaties. A proposed withdrawal may be cancelled if the Armed Forces modify the proposed activity to alleviate significant adverse effects on the population of a migratory bird species or the circumstances in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section no longer exist. Cancellation of suspension or withdrawal of authorization becomes effective upon delivery of written notice from the Secretary to the Department of Defense.</P>
              <P>(7) The responsibilities of the Secretary under paragraph (b) of this section may be fulfilled by his/her delegatee who must be an official nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception to the import permit requirements.</E> If you comply with the requirements of parts 14, 20, and 23 of this subchapter B, you do not need a migratory bird permit to import or possess migratory birds in the families Anatidae, Columbidae, Gruidae, Rallidae, and Scolopacidae for personal use that were lawfully hunted by you in a foreign country. The birds may be carcasses, skins, or mounts. You must provide evidence that you lawfully took the bird or birds in, and exported them from, the country of origin. This evidence must include a hunting license and any export documentation required by the country of origin. You must keep these documents with the imported bird or birds permanently.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">General exceptions to the export permit requirements.</E> You do not need a migratory bird export permit to:</P>
              <P>(1) Export live, captive-bred migratory game birds (see § 20.11 of this subpart) to Canada or Mexico if they are marked by one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(i) Removal of the hind toe from the right foot;</P>
              <P>(ii) Pinioning of a wing by removal of all or some of the metacarpal bones of one wing, which renders the bird permanently incapable of flight;</P>
              <P>(iii) Banding of one metatarsus with a seamless metal band; or</P>
              <P>(iv) A readily discernible tattoo of numbers and/or letters on the web of one foot.</P>

              <P>(2) Export live, lawfully-acquired, captive-bred raptors provided you hold a valid raptor propagation permit <PRTPAGE P="79"/>issued under § 21.30 and you obtain a CITES permit or certificate issued under part 23 to do so. You must have full documentation of the lawful origin of each raptor, and each must be identifiable with a seamless band issued by the Service, including any raptor with an implanted microchip for identification.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Falconry birds covered under a CITES “pet passport.”</E> You do not need a migratory bird import or export permit to temporarily export and subsequently import a raptor or raptors you lawfully possess for falconry to and from another country for use in falconry when the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) You must meet applicable requirements in part 14 (Importation, Exportation, and Transportation of Wildlife) of this subchapter B.</P>
              <P>(2) You may need one or more additional permits to take a bird from the United States or to return home with it (see 50 CFR part 15 (Wild Bird Conservation Act), part 17 (Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants), and part 23 (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)).</P>
              <P>(3) Each raptor must be covered by a CITES certificate of ownership issued under part 23 of this chapter. You must have full documentation of the lawful origin of each raptor (a copy of a propagation report with band number or a 3-186A report), and each must be identifiable with a seamless band or a permanent, nonreusable, numbered Fish and Wildlife Service leg band issued by the Service, including any raptor with an implanted microchip for identification. We may exempt a raptor from banding because of health concerns, but you must provide proof of the exemption from your falconry permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(4) You must bring any raptor that you export out of the country for falconry under a CITES “pet passport” back to the United States when you return.</P>
              <P>(5) If the raptor dies or is lost, you are not required to bring it back, but you must report the loss immediately upon your return to the United States in the manner required by the falconry regulations of your State, and according to any conditions on your CITES certificate.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Inspection of imported or exported migratory birds.</E> All migratory birds imported into, or exported from, the United States, and any associated documentation, may be inspected by the Service.

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Criteria we will consider before issuing a permit.</E> After we receive a completed import or export application, the Regional Director will decide whether to issue you a permit based on the general criteria of § 13.21 of this chapter, and whether you meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) You are at least 18 years of age;</P>
              <P>(2) The bird was lawfully acquired; and</P>

No person should construe the permit as opening, reopening, or extending any hunting season contrary to any regulations established under Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Who may receive a permit?</E> Only State wildlife agencies (State) are eligible to receive a permit to undertake the various goose management and control activities. Additionally, only employees or designated agents of a permitted State wildlife agency may undertake activities for injurious resident Canada geese in accordance with the conditions specified in the permit, conditions contained in 50 CFR part 13, and conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How does a State apply for a permit?</E> Any State wildlife agency wishing to obtain a permit must submit an application to the appropriate Regional Director (see § 13.11(b) of this subchapter) containing the general information and certification required by § 13.12(a) of this subchapter plus the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) A detailed statement showing that the goose management and control activities will either provide for human health and safety, protect personal property, or allow resolution of other injury to people or property;</P>
              <P>(2) An estimate of the size of the resident Canada goose breeding population in the State;</P>

              <P>(3) The requested annual take of resident Canada geese, including eggs and nests;<PRTPAGE P="84"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A statement indicating that the State will inform and brief all employees and designated agents of the requirements of these regulations and permit conditions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">What are the conditions of the permit?</E> The special Canada goose permits are subject to the general conditions in 50 CFR part 13, the conditions elsewhere in this section, and, unless otherwise specifically authorized on the permit, the conditions outlined below:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">What are the limitations on management and control activities?</E> (i) Take of resident Canada geese as a management tool under this section may not exceed the number authorized by the permit. States should utilize non-lethal goose management tools to the extent they deem appropriate in an effort to minimize lethal take.</P>
              <P>(ii) Methods of take for the control of injurious resident Canada geese are at the State's discretion. Methods include, but are not limited to, firearms, alpha-chloralose, traps, egg and nest manipulation and other damage control techniques consistent with accepted wildlife damage-management programs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">When may a State conduct management and control activities?</E> States and their employees and agents may conduct egg and nest manipulation activities at any time of year. Other management and control activities, including the take of resident Canada geese, under this section may only be conducted between March 11 and August 31.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">How must the States dispose or utilize geese taken under this permit?</E> States and their employees and agents may possess, transport, and otherwise dispose of Canada geese taken under this section. States must utilize such birds by donation to public museums or public institutions for scientific or educational purposes, by processing them for human consumption and distributing them free of charge to charitable organizations, or by burying or incinerating them. States, their employees, and designated agents may not sell, offer for sale, barter, or ship for the purpose of sale or barter any Canada geese taken under this section, nor their plumage or eggs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">How does the permit relate to existing State law?</E> No person conducting management and control activities under this section should construe the permit to authorize the killing of injurious resident Canada geese contrary to any State law or regulation, nor on any Federal land without specific authorization by the responsible management agency. No person may exercise the privileges granted under this section unless they possess any permits required for such activities by any State or Federal land manager.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">When conducting management and control activities, are there any special inspection requirements?</E> Any State employee or designated agent authorized to carry out management and control activities must have a copy of the permit and designation in their possession when carrying out any activities. The State must also require the property owner or occupant on whose premises the State is conducting activities to allow, at all reasonable times, including during actual operations, free and unrestricted access to any Service special agent or refuge officer, State wildlife or deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or other wildlife law enforcement officer (wildlife officer) on the premises where they are, or were, conducting activities. Furthermore, any State employee or designated agent conducting such activities must promptly furnish whatever information is required concerning such activities to any such wildlife officer.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">What are the reporting requirements of the permit?</E> Any State employee or designated agent exercising the privileges granted by this section must keep records of all activities carried out under the authority of this permit, including the number of Canada geese killed and their disposition. The State must submit an annual report detailing activities, including the time, numbers and location of birds, eggs, and nests taken and non-lethal techniques utilized, before December 31 of each year. The State should submit the annual report to the appropriate Assistant Regional Director—Refuges and Wildlife (see § 10.22 of this subchapter).</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">What are the limitations of the special permit?</E> The following limitations apply:<PRTPAGE P="85"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land within a State's boundaries without written permission of the Federal Agency with jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(ii) States may not undertake any actions under any permit issued under this section if the activities adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered Species Act.</P>
              <P>(iii) We will only issue permits to State wildlife agencies in the conterminous United States.</P>
              <P>(iv) States may designate agents who must operate under the conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">How long is the special permit valid?</E> A special Canada goose permit issued or renewed under this section expires on the date designated on the face of the permit unless it is amended or revoked or such time that we determine that the State's population of resident Canada geese no longer poses a threat to human health or safety, personal property, or injury to other interests. In all cases, the term of the permit may not exceed five (5) years from the date of issuance or renewal.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Can we revoke the special permit?</E> We reserve the right to suspend or revoke any permit, as specified in §§ 13.27 and 13.28 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">What are the OMB information collection requirements of the permit program?</E> OMB has approved the information collection requirements of the permit and assigned clearance number 1018-0099. Federal agencies may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We will use the information collection requirements to administer this program and in the issuance and monitoring of these special permits. We will require the information from State wildlife agencies responsible for migratory bird management in order to obtain a special Canada goose permit, and to determine if the applicant meets all the permit issuance criteria, and to protect migratory birds. We estimate the public reporting burden for this collection of information to average 8 hours per response for 45 respondents (States), including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Thus, we estimate the total annual reporting and record-keeping for this collection to be 360 hours. States may send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Falconry standards and falconry permitting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Background</E>—(1) <E T="03">The legal basis for regulating falconry.</E> The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits any person from taking, possessing, purchasing, bartering, selling, or offering to purchase, barter, or sell, among other things, raptors (birds of prey) listed in § 10.13 of this subchapter unless the activities are allowed by Federal permit issued under this part and part 13 of this chapter, or as permitted by regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(i) This section covers all Falconiformes (vultures, kites, eagles, hawks, caracaras, and falcons) and all Strigiformes (owls) listed in § 10.13 of this subchapter (“native” raptors), and applies to any person who possesses one or more wild-caught, captive-bred, or hybrid raptors protected under the MBTA to use in falconry.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d, 54 Stat. 250) provides for the taking of golden eagles from the wild to use in falconry. <PRTPAGE P="87"/>It specifies that the only golden eagles that may be taken from the wild for falconry are those that would be taken because of depredations on livestock or wildlife (16 U.S.C. 668a).</P>
              <P>(2) “<E T="03">Possession” and short-term handling of a falconry raptor.</E> We do not consider short-term handling, such as letting any other person hold or practice flying a raptor you possess under your permit, to be possession for the purposes of this section if you are present and the person is under your supervision.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Regulatory year for governing falconry.</E> For determining possession and take of raptors for falconry, a year is any 12-month period for take defined by the State, tribe, or territory.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal approval of State, tribal, and territorial falconry programs</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) A State (including the District of Columbia), tribe, or territory under the jurisdiction of the United States that wishes to allow falconry must establish laws and regulations (hereafter referred to as laws) that meet the standards established in this section. To allow the practice of falconry on tribal lands by tribal members or residents, a tribe may either certify that it has adopted Service-approved State laws if those laws are fully enforceable on tribal lands, or issue its own laws and request our approval.</P>
              <P>(ii) State, tribal, or territorial laws may be more restrictive than these Federal standards but may not be less restrictive. For instance, a State, tribe, or territory may choose not to allow possession of some species of raptors otherwise allowed in this section. State, tribal, and territorial laws must be consistent with the terms contained in any convention between the United States and any foreign country for the protection of raptors and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> (i) The State, tribe, or territory must work with us to ensure that the electronic 3-186A reporting system (<E T="03">http://permits.fws.gov/186A</E>) for reporting take, transfers, and loss of falconry birds is fully operational for residents of that jurisdiction.</P>

              <P>(ii) If you are required to submit a report or other information under this section, you must either enter the required information in the electronic database at <E T="03">http://permits.fws.gov/186A</E>, or at <E T="03">http://www.wildlife.ca.gov/FalconryReporting</E> if you are a resident of California, or submit a paper form 3-186A to your State, tribal, or territorial agency that governs falconry.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Federal approval and terms.</E> If we concur that the regulations and the examination meet the requirements of this section, we will publish a rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> adding the State, tribe, or territory to the list of those approved for allowing the practice of falconry. We will terminate Federal falconry permitting in any State certified under these regulations on January 1st of the calendar year following publication of the rule.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Review of a State, tribal, or territorial falconry program.</E> We may review the administration of an approved State's, tribe's, or territory's falconry program if complaints from the public or law enforcement investigations indicate the need for a review or for revisions to the State's, tribe's, or territory's laws, or falconry examination. The review may involve, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Inspecting falconers' facilities to ensure that the facilities standards in this section are met;</P>
              <P>(ii) Processing time of applications;</P>
              <P>(iii) Reviewing approved applications for completeness;</P>
              <P>(iv) Determining that permits issued are appropriate for the experience of the applicants;</P>
              <P>(v) Determining the adequacy of the State's, tribe's, or territory's recordkeeping for the needs of State, tribal, or territorial and Federal law enforcement;</P>
              <P>(vi) Reviewing laws to determine if they meet the requirements of this section; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Reviewing a revised falconry examination to determine if it meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Suspension of a State's, tribe's, or territory's certification.</E> (i) We may propose to suspend, and may suspend, the approval of a State, tribal, or territorial falconry program in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section if we determine that the State, tribe, or territory has <PRTPAGE P="88"/>deficiencies in one or more items in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) When we propose to suspend approval of a State, tribal, or territorial falconry program, we will first provide written notice to the State, tribe, or territory. Any such notice will include the basis for our determination that suspension is warranted. We will identify the actions that would, if implemented by the State, tribe, or territory, allow us to cancel the proposed suspension of approval.</P>
              <P>(iii) The State, tribe, or territory will have 2 years from the date of our notification to correct the deficiencies. The State, tribe, or territory must respond in writing within that time to the proposed suspension, specifying the reasons why the certification should not be suspended. We will give due consideration to any objections and evidence raised by the State, tribe, or territory.</P>
              <P>(iv) If we continue to believe that suspension is warranted, we will provide written notice of suspension, including the rationale for suspension, and respond to any objections to the suspension.</P>
              <P>(A) The suspension of approval of the State's, tribe's, or territory's falconry program will be effective 180 days from the date of the Service's final notification of suspension.</P>
              <P>(B) The State, tribe, or territory must then inform all falconry applicants and permittees of the impending cancellation of permitting.</P>
              <P>(v) We will honor all falconry permits in that jurisdiction for 2 years from the date of our final notification of suspension of certification. At the end of the 2 years, you must transfer all raptors (including captive-bred raptors) held under permits from the State, tribal, or territorial falconry program to other falconry permittees in other States or territories, or to Federal raptor propagation or education permittees, institutions exempt from the Federal permit requirements, or permanently released to the wild (if it is allowed by the State, tribe, or territory and by this section), or euthanized. However, you may not permanently release hybrid raptors to the wild.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Appeal of a decision to suspend State, tribal, or territorial certification.</E> The State, tribe, or territory may appeal a decision to suspend certification to the Director within 180 days of the date of the Director's decision. The Director will then respond to the State, tribe, or territory within 180 days of receipt of the appeal. The State, tribe, or territory certification will remain effective until the Director makes a final decision on the appeal.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Recertification of compliance with this section if a State's, tribe's, or territory's falconry permitting authority has been suspended.</E> If a State, tribe, or territory has had its falconry permitting authority suspended but has corrected its problems, it must submit a request for approval of its permitting activities. We will then either recertify the program, or report in writing why we do not believe that earlier permitting problems have been rectified.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Authority to suspend or revoke a falconry permit issued by a State, tribe, or territory.</E> Suspension or revocation of a falconry permit is the responsibility of the State, tribe, or territory. However, compliance with all provisions of these regulations remains under the purview of the Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Standards in effect in your place of residence.</E> If you live in any State except Hawaii, you may practice falconry as permitted in these regulations if you have a falconry permit from your State, tribe, or territory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Practicing falconry</E>—(1) <E T="03">Permits and inspections to practice falconry.</E> You must have a valid falconry permit from the State, tribe, or territory in which you reside (or the tribe on whose land you wish to practice falconry if you reside on tribal land or are a tribal member), to take, possess, or transport raptors for falconry, or to hunt with them. Depending on the game you hunt as a falconer and where you hunt, you also may need a Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp (a “Duck Stamp”), and State, tribal, or territorial hunting permits or stamps to hunt with a raptor.</P>

              <P>(i) Some State, tribal, territorial, or local governments may require you to have additional permits or licenses to practice falconry or to take a raptor from the wild.<PRTPAGE P="89"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) You must comply with all regulations governing migratory bird permitting.</P>
              <P>(iii) If you reside for more than 120 consecutive days in a State or territory or on tribal lands other than the location of your primary residence, your falconry facilities in the second location must meet the standards in paragraph (d) of this section and of the corresponding State, tribal, or territorial lands, and your facilities must be listed on your falconry permit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Classes of permit to practice falconry.</E> We recognize Apprentice, General, and Master Falconer levels. Each State, tribe, or territory may have any number of permit levels, but the standards for them must be at least as restrictive as these Federal standards. Your State, tribe, or territory may have more restrictive laws or regulations governing falconry.</P>
              <P>(i) Requirements and possession options for an Apprentice Falconer.</P>
              <P>(A) You must be at least 12 years of age.</P>
              <P>(B) If you are under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian must sign your application and is legally responsible for your activities.</P>
              <P>(C) You must have a letter from a Master Falconer or a General Falconer with a valid State, tribal, or territorial falconry permit who is at least 18 years old and has at least 2 years experience at the General Falconer level, stating that he or she will assist you, as necessary, in:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Learning about the husbandry and training of raptors held for falconry;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Learning and about relevant wildlife laws and regulations, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Deciding what species of raptor is appropriate for you to possess while an Apprentice.</P>
              <P>(D) Regardless of the number of State, tribal, or territorial falconry permits you have, you may possess no more than one raptor for use in falconry.</P>

              <P>(E) You may take raptors less than 1 year old, except nestlings, from the wild during any period or periods specified by the State, tribe, or territory. You may take any raptor species from the wild except a federally listed threatened or endangered species or the following species: Bald eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>), white-tailed eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus albicilla</E>), Steller's sea-eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus pelagicus</E>), golden eagle (<E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>), American swallow-tailed kite (<E T="03">Elanoides forficatus</E>), Swainson's hawk (<E T="03">Buteo swainsoni</E>), peregrine falcon (<E T="03">Falco peregrinus</E>), flammulated owl (<E T="03">Otus flammeolus</E>), elf owl (<E T="03">Micrathene whitneyi</E>), and short-eared owl (<E T="03">Asio flammeus</E>).</P>

              <P>(F) You may possess a raptor of any Falconiform or Strigiform species, including wild, captive-bred, or hybrid individuals, except a federally listed threatened or endangered species, a bald eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>), a white-tailed eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus albicilla</E>), a Steller's sea-eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus pelagicus</E>), or a golden eagle (<E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>).</P>
              <P>(G) You do not need to capture a wild raptor yourself; it can be transferred to you by another falconry permittee.</P>
              <P>(H) You may not possess a raptor taken from the wild as a nestling.</P>
              <P>(I) You may not possess a bird that is imprinted on humans.</P>
              <P>(J) Your raptor facilities must pass inspection by your State, tribe, or territory before you may be granted a permit.</P>

              <P>(C) You must submit a document from a General Falconer or Master Falconer (preferably your sponsor) to your State, tribal, or territorial wildlife agency stating that you have practiced falconry with raptor(s) at the Apprentice Falconer level or equivalent for at least 2 years, including maintaining, training, flying, and hunting the raptor(s) for least 4 months in each year. That practice may include capture and release of falconry raptors.</P>
              <P>(D) You may not substitute any falconry school program or education to shorten the period of 2 years at the Apprentice level.</P>

              <P>(E) You may take and possess any species of Falconiform or Strigiform except a golden eagle, a bald eagle, a <PRTPAGE P="90"/>white-tailed eagle, or a Steller's sea-eagle. You may use captive-bred individuals and hybrids of the species you are allowed to possess.</P>
              <P>(F) Regardless of the number of State, tribal, or territorial falconry permits you have, you may possess no more than 3 raptors.</P>
              <P>(iii) Requirements and possession options for a Master Falconer.</P>
              <P>(A) You must have practiced falconry with your own raptor(s) at the General Falconer level for at least 5 years.</P>
              <P>(B) You may take and possess any species of Falconiform or Strigiform except a bald eagle. However, you may take and possess a golden eagle, a white-tailed eagle, or a Steller's sea eagle only if you meet the qualifications set forth under paragraph (c)(2)(iv).</P>
              <P>(C) You may possess any captive-bred individuals or hybrids of species your State, tribe, or territory allows you to possess for use in falconry.</P>
              <P>(D) Regardless of the number of State, tribal, or territorial falconry permits you have, you may possess no more than 5 wild raptors, including golden eagles.</P>
              <P>(E) You may possess any number of captive-bred raptors. However, you must train them in the pursuit of wild game and use them in hunting.</P>
              <P>(iv) If you meet the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for falconry you may possess up to 3 eagles of the following species: golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, or Steller's sea eagle.</P>
              <P>(A) Your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry must document the following before approving your request to possess an eagle to use in falconry:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Your experience in handling large raptors, including information about the species you have handled and the type and duration of the activity in which you gained the experience.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) At least two letters of reference from people with experience handling and/or flying large raptors such as eagles, ferruginous hawks, goshawks (<E T="03">Accipiter gentilis</E>), or great horned owls (<E T="03">Bubo virginianus</E>). Each must contain a concise history of the author's experience with large raptors, which can include, but is not limited to, handling of raptors held by zoos, rehabilitating large raptors, or scientific studies involving large raptors. Each letter must also assess your ability to care for eagles and fly them in falconry.</P>
              <P>(B) A golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, or Steller's sea-eagle you hold will count as one of the raptors you are allowed to possess for use in falconry.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Taking a test to qualify for a falconry permit.</E> Before you are issued an Apprentice permit you must correctly answer at least 80 percent of the questions on an examination administered by the State, tribe, or territory under which you wish to obtain a falconry permit. The examination must cover care and handling of falconry raptors, Federal, State or territorial, and tribal (if applicable) laws and regulations relevant to falconry, and other appropriate subject matter. Contact your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry for information about permits and taking the test.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reinstatement of a lapsed falconry permit if your State, tribe, or territory allows it.</E> (i) If your permit has lapsed for fewer than 5 years, it may be reinstated at the level you held previously if you have proof of your certification at that level.</P>
              <P>(ii) If your permit has lapsed for 5 years or longer, you must correctly answer at least 80 percent of the questions on an examination administered by the State, tribe, or territory in which you wish to obtain a falconry permit. If you pass the exam, your permit may be reinstated at the level you previously held. Your facilities must pass State, tribal, or territorial inspection before you may possess a falconry bird.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Permit to practice falconry at an appropriate level if you have experience in falconry but are a new resident in the United States.</E> You may qualify for the falconry permit appropriate for your experience. To demonstrate your knowledge of U.S. falconry laws and regulations, you must correctly answer at least 80 percent of the questions on the supervised examination for falconers administered by the State, tribe, or territory under which you wish to obtain a falconry permit. If you <PRTPAGE P="91"/>pass the test, the State, tribe, or territory will decide for which level of falconry permit you are qualified, consistent with the class requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. To do so, the State, tribe, or territory should base its decision on your documentation of your experience. Your falconry facilities must meet the standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section before you may keep a raptor to use in falconry.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Banding or tagging raptors used in falconry.</E> (i) If you take a goshawk, Harris's hawk (<E T="03">Parabuteo unicinctus</E>), peregrine falcon (<E T="03">Falco peregrinus</E>), or gyrfalcon (<E T="03">Falco rusticolus</E>) from the wild or acquire one from another falconer or a rehabilitator, and if the raptor is not already banded, you must band it with a permanent, nonreusable, numbered U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service leg band that your State, tribal, or territorial agency will supply. If you wish, you may purchase and implant an ISO (International Organization for Standardization)-compliant (134.2 kHz) microchip in addition to the band. You must report the band number when you report your acquisition of the bird. Contact your State, tribal, or territorial agency for information on obtaining and disposing of bands. Within 10 days from the day on which you take the raptor from the wild, you must report take of the bird by submitting the required information (including the band number) using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. You may request an appropriate band from your State, tribal, or territorial agency in advance of any effort to capture a raptor. Your State, tribe, or territory may require that you band other species taken from the wild.</P>

              <P>(ii) A raptor bred in captivity must be banded with a seamless metal band (<E T="03">see</E> § 21.30). If you must remove a seamless band or if it is lost, within 10 days from the day you remove or note the loss of the band, you must report it and request a replacement U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service nonreusable band from your State, tribe, or territory. You must submit the required information using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. You must replace a seamless band that is removed or lost. You may implant an ISO-compliant (134.2 kHz) microchip in a falconry raptor in addition to the seamless band.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the band must be removed or is lost from a raptor in your possession, you must report the loss of the band within 5 days, and you must then do at least one of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Request a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service nonreusable band from your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry. You must submit the required information within 10 days of rebanding the raptor using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) Purchase and implant an ISO-compliant (134.2 kHz) microchip in the bird and report the microchip information using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must not alter, deface, or counterfeit a band. You may remove the rear tab on a band on a raptor you take from the wild, and you may smooth any imperfect surface if you do not affect the integrity of the band or the numbering on it.</P>
              <P>(v) If you document health or injury problems for a raptor you possess that are caused by the band, the State, tribe, or territory may provide an exemption to the requirement for that raptor. In that case, you must keep a copy of the exemption paperwork with you when transporting or flying the raptor. If your bird is a wild goshawk, Harris's hawk, peregrine falcon, or gyrfalcon, you must replace the band with an ISO-compliant microchip that we will supply to your State, tribe, or territory. We will not provide a microchip for a wild goshawk, Harris's hawk, peregrine falcon, or gyrfalcon unless you have demonstrated that a band causes an injury or a health problem for the bird.</P>
              <P>(vi) You may not band a raptor removed from the wild with a seamless numbered band.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Carrying your permit(s) when conducting falconry activities.</E> You must have your permit(s) or legible copies of them in your immediate possession if you are not at the location of your falconry facilities and you are trapping, transporting, working with, or flying your falconry raptor(s).<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Transporting a falconry raptor or raptors to other States or territories.</E> If you have a valid falconry permit, you may possess and transport for falconry purposes a lawfully possessed raptor through other States or territories. However, any State, tribe, or territory may further regulate such transport.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Facilities and care requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Facilities you must have and maintain.</E> You must keep all raptors you hold under your falconry permit in humane and healthful conditions.</P>
              <P>(i) Whether they are indoors (a “mews”) or outdoors (a “weathering area”), your raptor facilities must protect raptors in them from the environment, predators, and domestic animals. You are responsible for the maintenance and security (protection from predators) of raptors you possess under your permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must have raptor housing facilities approved by your State, tribe, or territory before you may obtain a bird to use in falconry. Your State, tribe, or territory may require that you have both indoor and outdoor facilities. A representative of your agency that regulates falconry, or its designee, must certify that your facilities and equipment meet the following standards:</P>
              <P>(A) For housing raptors indoors or outdoors, the facility must protect raptors from predators and domestic animals.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The facility must have a suitable perch for each raptor, at least one opening for sunlight, and must provide a healthy environment for raptors inside.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You may house untethered raptors together if they are compatible with each other.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Each raptor must have an area large enough to allow it to fly if it is untethered or, if tethered, to fully extend its wings or bate (attempt to fly while tethered) without damaging its feathers or contacting other raptors.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Each falconry bird must have access to a pan of clean water unless weather conditions, the perch type used, or some other factor makes access to a water pan unsafe for the raptor.</P>
              <P>(B) An indoor facility must be large enough to allow easy access for the care and feeding of raptors kept there.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If raptors you house in this indoor facility are not tethered, all walls that are not solid must be protected on the inside. Suitable materials may include vertical bars spaced narrower than the width of the body of the smallest raptor you house in the enclosure. However, heavy-duty netting or other such materials may be used to cover the walls or roof of the enclosure.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Acceptable indoor facilities include shelf perch enclosures where raptors are tethered side by side. Other innovative housing systems are acceptable if they provide the enclosed raptors with protection and allow them to maintain healthy feathers.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) An eyas raptor may be kept in any suitable container or enclosure until it is capable of flight.</P>
              <P>(C) You may keep a falconry raptor or raptors inside your place of residence if you provide a suitable perch or perches. If you house your raptor(s) inside your home, you do not need to modify windows or other openings of the structure. Raptors kept in your home must be tethered when they are not being moved into or out of the location in which they are kept.</P>
              <P>(D) An outdoor facility must be totally enclosed, and may be made of heavy-gauge wire, heavy-duty plastic mesh, slats, pipe, wood, or other suitable material.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The facility must be covered and have at least a covered perch to protect a raptor held in it from predators and weather.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The facility must be large enough to insure that the birds cannot strike the enclosure when flying from the perch.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) New types of housing facilities and/or husbandry practices may be used if they satisfy the requirements above and are approved by the State, tribal, or territorial authority regulating falconry.</P>

              <P>(iii) You may keep falconry raptors outside in the open if they are under watch, such as by you or a family member at any location or, for example, by a designated individual in a weathering yard at a falconry meet.<PRTPAGE P="93"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) You must inform your State, tribal, or territorial agency within 5 business days if you change the location of your facilities.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Falconry facilities on property you do not own</E>—(i) Your falconry facilities may be on property owned by another person where you reside, or at a different location. Regardless of location, the facilities must meet the standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and those of the State, tribe, or territory from which you have a falconry permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must submit to your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry a signed and dated statement showing that you agree that the falconry facilities and raptors may be inspected without advance notice by State, tribal (if applicable), or territorial authorities at any reasonable time of day, but you must be present. If your facilities are not on property that you own, you must submit a signed and dated statement showing that the property owner agrees that the falconry facilities and raptors may be inspected by State, tribal (if applicable), or territorial authorities at any reasonable time of day in the presence of the property owner; except that the authorities may not enter the facilities or disturb the raptors unless you are present.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Equipment you must have and maintain.</E> You must have jesses or the materials and equipment to make them, leash and swivel, bath container, and appropriate scales or balances for weighing raptor(s) you possess.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Facilities you must have for a raptor when you are transporting it, using it for hunting, or are away from your home with it.</E> You must be sure that the bird has a suitable perch and is protected from extreme temperatures, wind, and excessive disturbance. A “giant hood” or similar container is acceptable for transporting or housing a raptor when you are away from the permanent facility where it is housed.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Temporarily housing a raptor outside of your permanent facilities when you are not transporting it or using it for hunting.</E> You may house a raptor in temporary facilities for no more than 120 consecutive calendar days if the bird has a suitable perch and is protected from predators, domestic animals, extreme temperatures, wind, and excessive disturbance.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Care of falconry raptors by another falconry permittee.</E> Another falconry permittee may care for a raptor or raptors for you at your facilities or at that person's facilities for up to 120 consecutive calendar days. The other person must have a signed and dated statement from you authorizing the temporary possession, plus a copy of FWS form 3-186A that shows that you are the possessor of each of the raptors. The statement must include information about the time period for which he or she will keep the raptor(s), and about what he or she is allowed to do with it or them.</P>
              <P>(i) Your raptor(s) will remain on your falconry permit, and will not be counted against the possession limit of the person caring for your raptors.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the person caring for your raptor(s) holds the appropriate level falconry permit, he or she may fly your raptor(s) in whatever way you authorize, including hunting.</P>
              <P>(iii) This care of your raptors may be extended indefinitely in extenuating circumstances, such as illness, military service, or for a family emergency. The State, tribe, or territory may consider such instances on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Care of falconry raptors by someone who does not have a falconry permit.</E> Another person may care for falconry birds you possess at your facilities for up to 45 consecutive calendar days.</P>
              <P>(i) The raptor(s) will remain on your falconry permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) The raptors must remain in your facilities.</P>
              <P>(iii) This care may be extended indefinitely in extenuating circumstances, such as illness, military service, or for a family emergency.</P>
              <P>(iv) The person(s) caring for your raptors may not fly them for any reason.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Residence part of the year in another jurisdiction.</E> (i) The State, tribe, or territory in which you live part-time may require that you obtain its falconry permit. You must contact the State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry to determine whether you need a permit.</P>

              <P>(ii) If you live for more than 120 consecutive days in a State or territory or <PRTPAGE P="94"/>on tribal lands other than where you maintain your primary residence, your falconry facilities in the second State must meet the standards in this section.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Inspections.</E> Falconry equipment and records may be inspected in the presence of the permittee during business hours on any day of the week by State, tribal, or territorial officials.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Taking, possessing, and transporting raptors for falconry</E>—(1) <E T="03">Raptor species you may take from the wild to use for falconry.</E> (i) You may not intentionally capture a raptor species that your classification as a falconer does not allow you to possess for falconry. If you capture a bird you are not allowed to possess, you must release it immediately.</P>
              <P>(ii) On some tribal lands and in some States there may be State, tribal, or Federal restrictions on the take or use of these species, and you may need a tribal or State permit or permits to capture a bird.</P>
              <P>(iii) State, tribal, or territorial regulations on take may be more restrictive than those in this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Take of any species must be in compliance with these regulations.</P>
              <P>(v) If you are a Master Falconer and your State, tribe, or territory allows you to possess golden eagles, in any year you may take up to two golden eagles from the wild and only in a livestock depredation area during the time the depredation area and associated depredation permit or depredation control order are in effect. A livestock depredation area is declared by USDA Wildlife Services and permitted under § 22.23, or upon the request of a State governor and authorized by the Service Director pursuant to §§ 22.31 and 22.32.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">How and when you may take raptors from the wild to use in falconry.</E> You may take no more than two raptors from the wild each year to use in falconry.</P>
              <P>(i) If you transfer a bird you take from the wild to another permittee in the same year in which you capture it, the bird will count as one of the raptors you are allowed to take from the wild that year; it will not count as a capture by the recipient, though it will always be considered a wild bird.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you are a General or Master Falconer, you may remove nestlings from a nest or aerie in accordance with tribal (if applicable), State, territorial, and Federal restrictions.</P>
              <P>(iii) You may not take raptors at any time or in any manner that violates any law of the State, tribe, or territory on whose land you are trapping.</P>
              <P>(iv) If you are responsible for reporting take of a raptor from the wild, use one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. You must do this at your first opportunity to do so, but no later than 10 days after the capture of the bird.</P>
              <P>(v) If you are present at the capture site, even if another person captures the bird for you, you are considered the person who removes the bird from the wild. You are responsible for filing a 3-186A form reporting take of the bird from the wild. This would occur, for example, if another person climbs a tree or rappells down a cliff and takes a nestling for you and gives it to you at the tree or cliff.</P>
              <P>(vi) If you are not at the immediate location where the bird is taken from the wild, the person who removes the bird from the wild must be a General or Master Falconer, and must report take of the bird. If that person then transfers the bird to you, you must both file 3-186A forms reporting the transaction at your first opportunity to do so, but no later than 10 days after the transfer. The bird will count as one of the two raptors the person who took it from the wild is allowed to capture in any year. The bird will not count as a bird you took from the wild. The person who takes the bird from the wild must report the take even if he or she promptly transfers the bird to you.</P>
              <P>(vii) If you have a long-term or permanent physical impairment that prevents you from attending the capture of a species you can use for falconry, a General or Master Falconer may capture a bird for you. You are then responsible for filing a 3-186A form reporting take of the bird from the wild, and the bird will count against the take of wild raptors that you are allowed in any year.</P>
              <P>(viii) You must promptly release any bird you capture unintentionally.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other restrictions on taking raptors from the wild for falconry.</E> (i) If you are a General or Master Falconer, you may <PRTPAGE P="95"/>take only raptors less than 1 year of age from the wild during any period or periods specified by the State, tribe, or territory. However, you may take an American kestrel or great horned owl of any age from the wild during any period or periods specified by the State, tribe, or territory.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you are a Master Falconer authorized to possess golden eagles for use in falconry, you may capture a golden eagle in a livestock or wildlife depredation area during the time the depredation area and associated depredation permit or depredation control order are in effect.</P>
              <P>(A) You may capture an immature or subadult golden eagle.</P>
              <P>(B) You may take a nestling from its nest in a livestock depredation area if a biologist representing the agency responsible for declaring the depredation area has determined that the adult eagle is preying on livestock or wildlif</P>
              <P>(C) You may take a nesting adult golden eagle only if a biologist representing the agency responsible for declaring the depredation area has determined that the adult eagle is preying on livestock or wildlife and that any nestling of the adult will be taken by a falconer authorized to possess it or by the biologist and transferred to an individual authorized to possess it.</P>

              <P>(D) You must determine the locations of the livestock or wildlife depredation areas declared by USDA Wildlife Services, or published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by the Service in response to a State governor's request. We will not notify you about them.</P>

              <P>(E) Before you begin any trapping activities, you must inform our regional Law Enforcement office of your capture plans. You must notify the office in person, in writing, or via facsimile or email at least 3 business days before you start trapping. You may send an email with your trapping plans to <E T="03">lawenforcement@fws.gov,</E> or you may deliver your trapping plans in person or by mail to the Law Enforcement office in your region at the applicable street address provided at 50 CFR 2.2.

              <P>(F) You also must meet all requirements of the State or territory in which you plan to trap, or the tribe on whose lands you plan to trap.</P>
              <P>(G) You must have permission from the landowner to capture an eagle; or if you wish to capture one on public land, the responsible agency must allow it.</P>
              <P>(iii) You may recapture a falconry bird you have lost at any time. We do not consider recapture of a wild bird to be taking a bird from the wild.</P>
              <P>(iv) You may recapture a raptor wearing falconry equipment or a captive-bred bird at any time - even if you are not allowed to possess the species. The bird will not count against your possession limit, nor will its take from the wild count against your limit. You must report your recapture of the bird to your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry no more than 5 working days after the recapture. You must return a recaptured falconry bird to the person who lost it, if that person may legally possess it. Disposition of a bird whose legal possession cannot be determined will be at the discretion of the State, tribe, or territory.</P>
              <P>(v) You may take any raptor that you are authorized to possess from the wild if the bird is banded with a Federal Bird Banding Laboratory aluminum bandexcept that you may not take a banded peregrine falcon from the wild.</P>

              <P>(A) If a raptor (including a peregrine falcon) you capture is marked with a seamless metal band, a transmitter, or any other item identifying it as a falconry bird, you must report your capture of the bird to your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry no more than 5 working days after the capture. You must return a recaptured falconry bird to the person who lost it. If that person cannot possess the bird or does not wish to possess it, you may keep it. Otherwise, <PRTPAGE P="96"/>disposition of a bird whose legal possession cannot be determined will be at the discretion of the State, tribe, or territory. While you keep a bird for return to the person who lost it, the bird will not count against your possession limit or your limit on take of raptors from the wild if you have reported possessing the bird to your State, tribal, or territorial falconry permit office.</P>
              <P>(B) If you capture a peregrine falcon that has a research band (such as a colored band with alphanumeric codes) or a research marking attached to it, you must immediately release the bird, except that if the falcon has a transmitter attached to it, you are authorized to possess the bird up to 30 days if you wish to contact the researcher to determine if he or she wishes to replace the transmitter or its batteries. If the researcher wishes to do so, or to have the transmitter removed, the researcher or his or her designee can make the change or allow you to do so before you release the bird. If the researcher does not wish to keep the transmitter on the falcon, you may keep the bird if you captured it in circumstances in which capture of wild peregrines is allowed.</P>
              <P>(C) If a raptor you capture has any other band, research marking, or transmitter attached to it, you must promptly report the band numbers and all other relevant information to the Federal Bird Banding Laboratory at 1-800-327-2263.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You may contact the researcher and determine if he or she wishes to replace a transmitter attached to a bird you capture. If so, you are authorized to possess the bird up to 30 days until the researcher or his or her designee does so, or until you can replace it yourself. Disposition of the bird will be at the discretion of the researcher and your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If you possess such a bird temporarily, it will not count against your possession limit for falconry raptors.</P>
              <P>(vi) You must leave at least one young from any nest or aerie from which you take a nestling.</P>
              <P>(vii) If you are an Apprentice Falconer, you may not take a nestling from the wild.</P>
              <P>(viii) If you are a Master Falconer with a permit to do so, you may take, transport, or possess up to three eagles, including golden eagles, white-tailed eagles, or Steller's sea-eagles, subject to the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section and § 22.24 of this part. A golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, or Steller's sea-eagle you possess counts as a bird to be included under your possession limit.</P>
              <P>(ix) If you are a General or Master Falconer, you may take no more than one bird of a threatened species from the wild each year if the regulations in part 17 of this subchapter allow it and if you obtain a Federal endangered species permit to do so before you take the bird. You also may need a State, tribal, or territorial endangered species permit to take a listed species.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Take of a species or subspecies that was recently removed from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife to use in falconry.</E> We must first publish a management plan for the species. If take is allowed in the management plan, you may do so in accordance with the provisions for take in the plan.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Raptors injured due to falconer trapping efforts.</E> You have two options for dealing with a bird injured by your trapping efforts. In either case, you are responsible for the costs of care and rehabilitation of the bird.</P>
              <P>(i) You may put the bird on your falconry permit. You must report take of the bird using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section at your first opportunity to do so, but no more than 10 days after capture of the bird. You must then have the bird treated by a veterinarian or a permitted wildlife rehabilitator. The bird will count against your possession limit.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may give the bird directly to a veterinarian, or a permitted wildlife rehabilitator, or an appropriate wildlife agency employee. If you do so, it will not count against your allowed take or the number of raptors you may possess.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Acquisition, transfer, loss, or rebanding of a raptor.</E> (i) If you acquire a raptor; transfer, reband, or microchip a raptor; if a raptor you possess is stolen; if you lose a raptor to the wild and you <PRTPAGE P="97"/>do not recover it within 30 days; or if a bird you possess for falconry dies; you must report the change within 10 days using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a raptor you possess is stolen, you must report the theft to your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry and to your Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Law Enforcement office (see paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E) of this section) within 10 days of the theft of the bird.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must keep copies of all electronic database submissions documenting take, transfer, loss, rebanding or microchipping of each falconry raptor until 5 years after you have transferred or lost the bird, or it has died.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Acquiring a bird for falconry from a permitted rehabilitator.</E> You may acquire a raptor of any age of a species that you are permitted to possess directly from a rehabilitator. Transfer to you is at the discretion of the rehabilitator.</P>
              <P>(i) If you acquire a bird from a rehabilitator, within 10 days of the transaction you must report it using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you acquire a bird from a rehabilitator, it will count as one of the raptors you are allowed to take from the wild that year.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Flying a hybrid raptor in falconry.</E> When flown free, a hybrid raptor must have attached at least two functioning radio transmitters to help you to locate the bird.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Releasing a falconry bird to the wild.</E> You must follow all applicable State or territorial and Federal laws and regulations before releasing a falconry bird to the wild.</P>
              <P>(i) If the raptor you wish to release is not native to the State or territory, or is a hybrid of any kind, you may not permanently release the bird to the wild. You may transfer it to another falconry permittee.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the species you wish to release is native to the State or territory and is captive-bred, you may not release the bird to the wild unless you have permission from the State, tribe, or territory to release the bird. If you are permitted to do so, you must hack the bird (allow it to adjust) to the wild at an appropriate time of year and an appropriate location. You must remove its falconry band (if it has one) and report release of the bird by submitting the required information using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the species you wish to release is native to the State and was taken from the wild, you may release the bird only at an appropriate time of year and an appropriate location. You must remove its falconry band and report release of the bird by submitting the required information using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Restrictions on transfers of falconry raptors from other falconers.</E> We do not restrict the number of wild-caught or captive-bred raptors transferred to you, but you may not exceed your possession limit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional information on the practice of falconry</E>—(1) <E T="03">Raptors removed from the wild for falconry are always considered “wild” raptors.</E> No matter how long such a bird is held in captivity or whether it is transferred to another permittee or permit type, it is always considered a “wild” bird. However, it is considered to be taken from the wild only by the person who originally captured it. We do not consider the raptor to be taken from the wild by any subsequent permittee to whom it is legally transferred.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">“Hacking” of falconry raptors.</E> Hacking (temporary release to the wild) is an approved method for falconers to condition raptors for falconry. If you are a General Falconer or a Master Falconer, you may hack a falconry raptor or raptors.</P>
              <P>(i) You may need permission from your State, tribal, or territorial wildlife agency to hack a bird you possess for falconry. Check with your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry to determine if hacking is allowed.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any bird you are hacking counts against your possession limit and must be a species you are authorized to possess.</P>

              <P>(iii) Any hybrid you hack must have two attached functioning radio transmitters during hacking.<PRTPAGE P="98"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) You may not hack a falconry bird near a nesting area of a Federally threatened or endangered bird species or in any other location where the raptor is likely to harm a Federally listed threatened or endangered animal species that might be disturbed or taken by your falconry bird. You should contact your State or territorial wildlife agency before hacking a falconry bird to ensure that this does not occur. You can contact the State Fish and Wildlife Service office in your State or territory for information on Federally-listed species.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of other falconry training or conditioning techniques.</E> You may use other acceptable falconry practices, such as, but not limited to, the use of creance (tethered) flying, lures, balloons, or kites in training or conditioning falconry raptors. You also may fly falconry birds at bird species not protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or at pen-raised animals.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Selling or trading raptors under a falconry permit.</E> (i) If allowed by your State, tribe or territory, you may sell, purchase, or barter, or offer to sell, purchase, or barter captive-bred raptors marked with seamless bands to other permittees who are authorized to possess them.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may not purchase, sell, trade, or barter wild raptors. You may only transfer them.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Transfer of wild-caught raptors captured for falconry to another type of permit.</E> Under some circumstances you may transfer a raptor to another permit type if the recipient of the bird (which could be you) possesses the necessary permits for the other activity.</P>
              <P>(i) If your State, tribe, or territory allows you to do so, you may transfer a wild-caught falconry bird to a raptor propagation permit after the bird has been used in falconry for at least 2 years (1 year for a sharp-shinned hawk, a Cooper's hawk, a merlin, or an American kestrel). When you transfer the bird, you must provide a copy of the 3-186A form documenting acquisition of the bird by the propagator to the Federal migratory bird permit office that administers the propagation permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may transfer a wild-caught bird to another permit type in less than 2 years (1 year for a sharp-shinned hawk, a Cooper's hawk, a merlin, or an American kestrel) if the bird has been injured and a veterinarian or permitted wildlife rehabilitator has determined that the bird can no longer be flown for falconry.</P>
              <P>(A) Within 10 days of transferring the bird , you must provide a copy of the 3-186A form documenting acquisition of the bird to the Federal migratory bird permit office that administers the other permit type.</P>
              <P>(B) When you transfer the bird, you must provide a copy of the certification from the veterinarian or rehabilitator that the bird is not useable in falconry to the Federal migratory bird permits office that administers the other permit type.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Transfer of captive-bred falconry raptors to another type of permit.</E> You may transfer captive-bred falconry raptors if the holder of the other permit type is authorized to possess the bird(s). Within 10 days, you must report the transfer by submitting the required information using one of the methods listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Use of raptors held under a falconry permit in captive propagation.</E> You may use raptors you possess for falconry in captive propagation if you or the person overseeing the propagation has the necessary permit(s) (see § 21.30). You do not need to transfer a bird from your falconry permit if you use it for fewer than 8 months in a year in captive propagation, but you must do so if you permanently transfer the bird for propagation. The bird must then be banded as required in § 21.30.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Use of falconry raptors in conservation education programs.</E> If you are a General or Master Falconer, you may use a bird you possess in conservation education programs presented in public venues.</P>
              <P>(i) You do not need a Federal education permit to conduct conservation education activities using a falconry raptor held under a State, tribal, or territorial falconry permit.</P>

              <P>(ii) You may present conservation programs as an Apprentice Falconer if you are under the supervision of a General or Master Falconer when you do so.<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) You must use the bird primarily for falconry.</P>
              <P>(iv) You may charge a fee for presentation of a conservation education program. The fee may not exceed the amount required to recoup your costs.</P>
              <P>(v) In conservation education programs, you must provide information about the biology, ecological roles, and conservation needs of raptors and other migratory birds, although not all of these topics must be addressed in every presentation. You may not give presentations that do not address falconry and conservation education.</P>

              <P>(vi) You are responsible for all liability associated with conservation education activities you undertake (<E T="03">see</E> 50 CFR 13.50).</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Other educational uses of falconry raptors.</E> You may allow photography, filming, or other such uses of falconry raptors to make movies or other sources of information on the practice of falconry or on the biology, ecological roles, and conservation needs of raptors and other migratory birds, though you may not be paid for doing so.</P>
              <P>(i) You may not use falconry raptors to make movies, commercials, or in other commercial ventures that are not related to falconry.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may not use falconry raptors for commercial entertainment; for advertisements; as a representation of any business, company, corporation, or other organization; or for promotion or endorsement of any products, merchandise, goods, services, meetings, or fairs, with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>(A) You may use a falconry raptor to promote or endorse a nonprofit falconry organization or association.</P>
              <P>(B) You may use a falconry raptor to promote or endorse products or endeavors related to falconry, including, but not limited to items such as hoods, telemetry equipment, giant hoods, perches, materials for raptor facilities, falconry training and education materials, and scientific research and publication.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Assisting in rehabilitation of raptors to prepare them for release.</E> If your State, tribe, or territory allows you to do so, and if you are a General or Master Falconer, you may assist a permitted migratory bird rehabilitator to condition raptors in preparation for their release to the wild. You may keep a bird you are helping to rehabilitate in your facilities.</P>
              <P>(i) The rehabilitator must provide you with a letter or form that identifies the bird and explains that you are assisting in its rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(ii) You do not need to meet the rehabilitator facility standards. You need only meet the facility standards in this section; your facilities are not subject to inspection for compliance with the standards in § 21.31.</P>
              <P>(iii) You do not have to add any raptor you possess for this purpose to your falconry permit; it will remain under the permit of the rehabilitator.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must return any such bird that cannot be permanently released to the wild to the rehabilitator for placement within the 180-day timeframe in which the rehabilitator is authorized to possess the bird, unless the issuing office authorizes you to retain the bird for longer than 180 days.</P>
              <P>(v) Upon coordination with the rehabilitator, you must release all releaseable raptors to the wild or return them to the rehabilitator for release within the 180-day timeframe in which the rehabilitator is authorized to possess the birds, unless the issuing office authorizes you to retain and condition a bird for longer than 180 days, or unless the rehabilitator transfers the bird to you to hold under your falconry permit.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Using a falconry bird in abatement activities.</E> (i) If you are a Master Falconer, you may conduct abatement activities with a bird or birds you possess for falconry. If you are a General Falconer, you may conduct abatement activities only as a subpermittee of the holder of the abatement permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may receive payment for providing abatement services if you have a Special Purpose Abatement permit.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Feathers that a falconry bird or birds molts.</E> (i) For imping (replacing a damaged feather with a molted feather), you may possess tail feathers and primary and secondary wing feathers for each species of raptor you possess or previously held for as long as you have a valid falconry permit. You may receive feathers for imping from other permitted falconers, wildlife <PRTPAGE P="100"/>rehabilitators, or propagators in the United States, and you may give feathers to them. You may not buy, sell, or barter such feathers.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may donate feathers from a falconry bird, except golden eagle feathers, to any person or institution with a valid permit to have them, or to anyone exempt from the permit requirement under § 21.12.</P>
              <P>(iii) Except for primary or secondary flight feathers or retrices from a golden eagle, you are not required to gather feathers that are molted or otherwise lost by a falconry bird. You may leave the feathers where they fall, store them for imping, or destroy them. However, you must collect molted flight feathers and retrices from a golden eagle. If you choose not to keep them for imping, you must send them to the National Eagle Repository.</P>
              <P>(iv) We request that you send all feathers (including body feathers) that you collect from any falconry golden eagle and that you do not need for imping, to the National Eagle Repository at the following address: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Eagle Repository, Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Building 128, Commerce City, Colorado 80022. The telephone number at the Repository is 303-287-2110.</P>
              <P>(v) If your permit expires or is revoked, you must donate the feathers of any species of falconry raptor except a golden eagle to any person or any institution exempt from the permit requirement under § 21.12 or authorized by permit to acquire and possess the feathers. If you do not donate the feathers, you must burn, bury, or otherwise destroy them.</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">Disposition of carcasses of falconry birds that die.</E> (i) You must send the entire body of a golden eagle you held for falconry, including all feathers, talons, and other parts, to the National Eagle Repository.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may donate the body or feathers of any other species of falconry raptor to any person or institution exempt under § 21.12 or authorized by permit to acquire and possess such parts or feathers.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the bird was banded or microchipped prior to its death, you may keep the body of any falconry raptor except that of a golden eagle. You may keep the body so that the feathers are available for imping, or you may have the body mounted by a taxidermist. You may use the mount in giving conservation education programs. If the bird was banded, you must leave the band on the body. If the bird has an implanted microchip, you must leave the microchip in place.</P>
              <P>(iv) If you do not wish to donate the bird body or feathers or keep it yourself, you must burn, bury, or otherwise destroy it or them within 10 days of the death of the bird or after final examination by a veterinarian to determine cause of death. Carcasses of euthanized raptors could pose a risk of secondary poisoning of eagles and other scavengers. You must take appropriate precautions to avoid such poisonings.</P>
              <P>(v) If you do not donate the bird body or feathers or have the body mounted by a taxidermist, you may possess the flight feathers for as long as you have a valid falconry permit. However, you may not buy, sell, or barter the feathers. You must keep the paperwork documenting your acquisition of the bird.</P>
              <P>(14) <E T="03">Visitors practicing falconry in the United States.</E> (i) A visitor to the United States may qualify for a temporary falconry permit appropriate for his or her experience.</P>
              <P>(A) The permit may be valid for any period specified by the State, tribe, or territory.</P>
              <P>(B) To demonstrate knowledge of U.S. falconry laws and regulations, the visitor must correctly answer at least 80 percent of the questions on the supervised examination for falconers administered by the tribe, State, or territory from which he or she wishes to obtain a temporary falconry permit. If the visitor passes the test, the tribe, State, or territory will decide for what level of temporary permit the person is qualified. The decision should be based on the individual's documentation of his or her experience.</P>
              <P>(C) If you hold a temporary falconry permit, you may possess raptors for falconry if you have approved falconry facilities.</P>

              <P>(D) A holder of a temporary falconry permit may fly raptors held for falconry by a permitted falconer.<PRTPAGE P="101"/>
              </P>
              <P>(E) A holder of a temporary falconry permit may not take a bird from the wild to use in falconry.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the duration of a permit from a State, tribe, or territory, a visitor may use any bird for falconry that he or she possess legally in his or her country of residence for that purpose, provided that import of that species to the United States is not prohibited, and provided that he or she has met all permitting requirements of his or her country of residence.</P>
              <P>(A) A visitor must comply with the provisions in this section, those of the State, tribe or territory where he or she wishes to conduct falconry, and all States through which he or she will travel with the bird.</P>

              <P>(B) The visitor may transport registered raptors. He or she may need one or more additional permits to bring a raptor into the United States or to return home with it (<E T="03">see</E> 50 CFR part 14 (importation, exportation, and transportation of wildlife), part 15 (Wild Bird Conservation Act), part 17 (endangered and threatened species), part 21 (migratory bird import and export permits), and part 23 (endangered species convention)).</P>
              <P>(C) Unless the visitor has the necessary permit(s) to bring a raptor into the United States and leave it here, he or she must take raptors brought into the country for falconry out of the country when he or she leaves. If a raptor brought into the United States dies or is lost while in this country, the visitor must document the loss before leaving the United States by reporting the loss to the State, tribal, or territorial agency that governs falconry where the bird was lost.</P>
              <P>(D) When flown free, any bird brought to this country temporarily must have two attached radio transmitters that will allow the falconer to locate it.</P>
              <P>(E)There also may be tribal or State restrictions on nonresidents practicing falconry or importing a raptor or raptors held for falconry.</P>
              <P>(15) <E T="03">Taking falconry raptors to another country to use in falconry activities.</E> A permit issued under this section authorizes you to export and then import raptors you legally possess for falconry to another country to use in falconry without an additional migratory bird import/export permit issued under § 21.21.</P>
              <P>(i) You must meet any requirements in 50 CFR 14 subpart B.</P>

              <P>(ii) You may need one or more additional permits to take a bird from the United States or to return home with it (<E T="03">see</E> 50 CFR part 15 (Wild Bird Conservation Act), part 17 (endangered and threatened species), and part 23 (endangered species convention)).</P>
              <P>(iii) Unless you have the necessary permit(s) to permanently export a raptor from the United States, you must bring any raptor you take out of the country for falconry back to the United States when you return. Each raptor must be covered by a CITES certificate of ownership issued under part 23 of this chapter. You must have full documentation of the lawful origin of each raptor (a copy of a propagation report with band number or a 3-186A report), and each must be identifiable with a seamless band or a permanent, nonreusable, numbered Fish and Wildlife Service leg band issued by the Service or an implanted microchip for identification.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the raptor dies or is lost, you are not required to bring it back but must report the loss immediately upon your return to the United States in the manner required by the falconry regulations of your State, and any conditions on your CITES certificate.</P>
              <P>(16) <E T="03">Permission to capture, fly, or release a falconry bird at any location.</E> You do not need special or written permission for any of these activities on public lands if it is authorized. However, you must comply with all applicable Federal, State, tribal, or territorial laws regarding falconry activities, including hunting. Your falconry permit does not authorize you to capture or release raptors or practice falconry on public lands if it is prohibited on those lands, or on private property, without permission from the landowner or custodian.</P>
              <P>(17) <E T="03">Practicing falconry in the vicinity of a Federally listed threatened or endangered animal species.</E> In practicing falconry you must ensure that your activities do not cause the take of Federally listed threatened or endangered wildlife. “Take” under the Endangered <PRTPAGE P="102"/>Species Act means “to harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct” (Endangered Species Act § 3(18)). Within this definition, “harass” means any act that may injure wildlife by disrupting normal behavior, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering, and harm” means an act that actually kills or injures wildlife (50 CFR 17.3). To obtain information about threatened or endangered species that may occur in your State or on tribal lands where you wish to practice falconry, contact your State, tribal, or territorial agency that regulates falconry. You can contact your State Fish and Wildlife Service office for information on Federally-listed species.</P>
              <P>(18) <E T="03">Trapping a bird for use in falconry in areas used by the northern aplomado falcon.</E> Capture of a northern aplomado falcon (<E T="03">Falco femoralis septentrionalis</E>) is not authorized because it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act. To avoid trapping northern aplomado falcons, you must comply with the following conditions when trapping a bird for use in falconry in the following counties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Raptor propagation permits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Legal basis for regulating raptor propagation.</E> (1) Among other actions, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) prohibits any person from capturing from the wild, possessing, purchasing, bartering, selling, or offering to purchase, barter, or sell raptors (vultures, kites, eagles, hawks, caracaras, falcons, and owls) listed in § 10.13 of this chapter unless the activities are allowed by Federal permit issued pursuant to this part and part 13 of this chapter, or as permitted by regulations in this part.</P>

              <P>(i) This section covers all “native” raptors (accipitriformes, falconiformes, and strigiformes listed in § 10.13 of this chapter), and applies to any person who possesses one or more wild-caught, captive-bred, or hybrid raptors protected under the MBTA to use in raptor propagation, except that neither bald eagles (<E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>) nor golden eagles (<E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>) may be propagated under these regulations or any other permit regulation listed in part 21 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must have a Federal raptor propagation permit before you may capture from the wild, possess, transport, import, purchase, barter, or offer to sell, purchase, or barter any raptor, raptor egg, or raptor semen for propagation purposes. Your State may require that you also have a State permit.</P>
              <P>(2) Other regulations, such as those for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the Wild Bird Conservation Act, and State regulations, may affect propagation-related activities. In cases in which more than one set of regulations affect raptor propagation, the most restrictive requirements affecting the activity will apply.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Species available for raptor propagation.</E> If you have a raptor propagation permit, you may attempt to propagate any species of raptor listed in § 10.13 of this chapter, with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>(1) You may not propagate bald eagles (<E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>) or golden eagles (<E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>) under a raptor propagation permit or any other permit regulation listed in part 21 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) If you are authorized by your Regional Migratory Bird Permit office to do so, you may possess and attempt to propagate threatened or endangered raptor species. See paragraphs (f) and (u) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Facilities used for raptor propagation.</E> In addition to the general conditions found in part 13 of this chapter, raptor propagation permits are subject to the following additional conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) You must maintain any tethered raptor you possess under this permit in accordance with the facilities and standards requirements in § 21.29, unless you obtain a written exception to this requirement from your Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office.</P>
              <P>(2) For untethered raptors, your breeding facilities must be soundly constructed and entirely enclosed with wood, wire netting, or other suitable material that provides a safe, healthy environment.</P>
              <P>(i) Your facilities must minimize the risk of injury by providing protection from predators, pets, and extreme weather conditions.</P>
              <P>(ii) Your facilities must minimize the risk of raptor injuries due to collision with interior or perimeter construction materials and equipment, such as support poles, windows, wire netting, perches, or lights.</P>
              <P>(iii) Your facilities must have suitable perches and nesting sites, fresh air ventilation, a source of light, a well-drained floor, and ready access for cleaning. Each bird must have access to a pan of clean water unless weather conditions, the perch type used, or some other factor makes access to a water pan unsafe for the raptor.</P>

              <P>(iv) You do not need to house your propagation raptors separately from other raptors you hold. However, you must keep raptors that you are not authorized to propagate separated from those you use in propagation.<PRTPAGE P="105"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> In the presence of the permittee, Federal or State officials may inspect propagation raptors, facilities, equipment, and records during business hours on any day of the week.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Banding of raptors used for propagation.</E> —(1) <E T="03">Certain species.</E> You must band a goshawk (<E T="03">Accipiter gentilis</E>), Harris's hawk (<E T="03">Parabuteo unicinctus</E>), peregrine falcon (<E T="03">Falco peregrinus</E>), or gyrfalcon (<E T="03">Falco rusticolus</E>) that you take from the wild to use in captive propagation.</P>
              <P>(i) You must use a nonreusable band that we provide.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may purchase and implant an ISO (International Organization for Standardization)-compliant 134.2 kHz microchip in the raptor in addition to banding it.</P>

              <P>(iii) You must report the information on the raptor (including information identifying the microchip, if you implant one, and where it is located) at <E T="03">http://permits.fws.gov/186A</E> or by submitting a paper FWS Form 3-186A form to your State or tribal agency that governs propagation, if applicable, and to us.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Banding nestlings.</E> Unless a particular nestling is specifically exempted, you must band every captive-bred raptor within 2 weeks of hatching.</P>
              <P>(i) You must use a numbered, seamless band that we will provide.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must use a band with an inside diameter that is small enough to prevent loss or removal of the band when the raptor is grown without causing serious injury to the raptor or damaging the band's integrity or one-piece construction.</P>
              <P>(iii) You may band a nestling with more than one band of different sizes if you cannot determine the proper size when you band the nestling. You must then remove and destroy all but the correctly sized band before the nestling is 5 weeks old.</P>
              <P>(iv) You may submit a letter requesting an exemption from the banding requirement for any nestling or fledgling for which the band causes a problem. If you demonstrate that the band itself or the behavior of the raptor in response to the band poses a hazard to the raptor, we may exempt that raptor from the banding requirement. You must destroy the band after you remove it.</P>
              <P>(3) You may purchase and implant an ISO-compliant 134.2 kHz microchip in the raptor in addition to a band. You must report information to identify the microchip and where on the raptor the chip is implanted when you report your acquisition of the raptor.</P>
              <P>(4) If a captive-bred raptor is not banded with a seamless band, or if you must remove the seamless band from a captive-bred raptor, you must band the bird with a nonreusable band that we provide.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Taking and transferring raptors or raptor eggs from the wild to use in propagation.</E> You may take no more than two raptors or raptor eggs from the wild each year to use in propagation.</P>
              <P>(1) The State must authorize you to take the raptor(s) or egg(s) from the wild.</P>
              <P>(2) You must comply with all State laws in taking raptor(s) or egg(s) from the wild.</P>
              <P>(3) You may take a raptor listed in § 17.11(h) of this chapter as “endangered” or “threatened” from the wild only if you have a permit under part 17 of this chapter (See paragraph (u) of this section.).</P>
              <P>(4) You may transfer a raptor taken from the wild for propagation to any other person authorized to possess it, except that you must comply with the prohibitions in § 21.29 on a transfer to a falconer.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Transfer, purchase, sale, or barter of captive-bred raptors, eggs, or semen.</E> (1) You may transfer, sell, or barter a lawfully possessed captive-bred raptor to another person authorized to possess captive-bred raptors if the raptor is marked on the metatarsus by a seamless, numbered band that we provide.</P>
              <P>(2) You may transfer, sell, or barter a lawfully possessed raptor egg or raptor semen produced by a raptor held under your captive propagation permit (including a raptor taken from the wild) to another raptor propagation permittee.</P>

              <P>(3) You may not purchase, sell, or barter any raptor eggs or any raptors taken from the wild in the United States or its territories or possessions, any semen collected from a raptor in <PRTPAGE P="106"/>the wild in the United States or its territories or possessions, or any raptor hatched from eggs taken from the wild in the United States or its territories or possessions.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Required paperwork.</E> You must have a copy of a properly completed FWS Form 3-186A (Migratory Bird Acquisition and Disposition Report) for each raptor you acquire or that is transferred to you.</P>
              <P>(1) You do not have to submit or have a copy of an FWS Form 3-186A for raptors you produce by captive propagation if you keep the raptors in your possession under your propagation permit.</P>
              <P>(2) If you sell, trade, barter, or transfer a raptor held under your captive propagation permit, even if the transfer is to a falconry permit you hold, you must complete an FWS Form 3-186A and send it to us within 5 calendar days of the transfer.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Care of a propagation raptor by another person</E>—</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Care of a propagation raptor by another permittee.</E> The regulations in this paragraph pertain to care of propagation raptors by persons other than the permittee. Another person who can legally possess raptors may care for a propagation raptor for you for up to 120 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(i) The person must have a letter from you authorizing him or her to care for the birds, beginning on the date of your letter.</P>
              <P>(ii) The raptor will remain on your raptor propagation permit. If the person who temporarily holds it for you is a falconer or a captive propagator, the raptor will not be counted against his or her possession limit on raptors held for falconry or propagation. However, the other person may not use the raptor in falconry or in propagation.</P>
              <P>(iii) If you wish to have someone else care for a propagation raptor for more than 120 days, or if you wish to let another person use the raptor in falconry or captive propagation, you must transfer the raptor to that person and report the transfer by submitting a completed FWS Form 3-186A.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Care of a propagation raptor by an individual who does not have a propagation or falconry permit.</E> Another person may care for propagation raptors you possess for up to 120 consecutive calendar days.</P>
              <P>(i) The raptor(s) will remain on your propagation permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) The raptors must remain in your facilities.</P>
              <P>(iii) This care may be extended indefinitely in extenuating circumstances, such as illness, military service, or for a family emergency. The person(s) caring for your raptors may not fly them for any reason.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Care of nestlings by an individual who does not hold a migratory bird permit.</E> Another person may temporarily care for and band nestlings you hold from the time they are hatched until they are fully feathered. You may allow the other person to keep the nestlings at another location. You must give the individual a letter authorizing him or her to care for the nestlings, beginning on the date of your letter. The care might be part of each day during the nestling period so that the nestlings can be fed, or it might be a series of full days if transport to and from the breeding facility is not practical or needed.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Disposition of molted feathers from a live raptor or carcasses of raptors held under your permit.</E> (1) You may donate the body or feathers of any species you possess under your propagation permit to any person or institution exempt under § 21.12 or authorized by permit to acquire and possess such parts or feathers.</P>
              <P>(2) For any raptor you hold under your propagation permit, if the bird was banded or microchipped prior to its death, you may keep the body to have the feathers available for imping or to have the body mounted by a taxidermist. You may use the mount in propagation activities or in giving conservation education programs. If the bird was banded, you must leave the band on the body. If the bird has an implanted microchip, the microchip must be placed inside the mounted bird.</P>

              <P>(3) If you do not wish to donate the bird body or feathers or keep it or them yourself, you must burn, bury, or otherwise destroy it or them within 10 days of the death of the bird or after final examination by a veterinarian to determine cause of death. Carcasses of euthanized raptors could pose a risk of <PRTPAGE P="107"/>secondary poisoning of eagles and other scavengers. You must take appropriate precautions to avoid such poisonings.</P>
              <P>(4) If you do not donate the bird body or feathers or have the body mounted by a taxidermist, you may possess the flight feathers for as long as you have a valid raptor propagation or falconry permit. However, you may not buy, sell, or barter the feathers. You must keep the paperwork documenting your acquisition of the bird.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Raptor products.</E> You may possess addled or blown eggs, nests, and feathers from raptors held under permit, and may transfer any of these items to any other person authorized to possess them.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Release to the wild.</E> You may release a captive-bred raptor to the wild if it is allowed by the State or territory in which you wish to release the raptor, except that you may not release a hybrid raptor to the wild. You must leave the captive-bred band on any raptor you release to the wild.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Conservation education programs.</E> You may use a raptor you possess for raptor propagation in conservation education programs presented in public venues.</P>
              <P>(1) You do not need a Federal education permit to conduct conservation education activities using a propagation raptor.</P>
              <P>(2) You must use the raptor primarily for propagation.</P>
              <P>(3) You may charge a fee for presentation of a conservation education program. The fee may not exceed the amount required to recoup your costs.</P>
              <P>(4) In conservation education programs, you must provide information about the biology, ecological roles, and conservation needs of raptors and other migratory birds, although not all of these topics must be addressed in every presentation. You may not give presentations that do not address falconry and conservation education.</P>
              <P>(5) You are responsible for all liability associated with conservation education activities you undertake (see § 13.50 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Permit restrictions.</E> With limited exceptions, you may use raptors held under your captive propagation permit only for propagation or keep them to transfer or sell. You must transfer a raptor used in captive propagation to a falconry permit before you or another person may use it in falconry. If you transfer a raptor used in captive propagation to another permit, you and the recipient of the raptor (which might be you) must complete an FWS Form 3-186A and report the transfer. You do not need to transfer a bird from your falconry permit (if you hold one) if you use the bird for fewer than 8 months in a year in captive propagation, but you must do so if you permanently transfer the bird for propagation. The bird must then be banded as required in paragraph (e).</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Training propagation raptors.</E> You may use falconry training or conditioning practices such as, but not limited to, creance (tethered) flying, lures, balloons, or kites in training or conditioning captive-bred progeny of raptors you hold under your permit.</P>
              <P>(1) Until the raptors are 1 year old, you may use captive-bred offspring in actual hunting as a means of training them. To do so, you will not need to transfer them to another permit type. You may not use them in hunting after their first year if they are held under your captive propagation permit.</P>
              <P>(2) Any hybrid raptor that you fly free must have at least two attached radio transmitters to help you to locate the bird.</P>
              <P>(3) You may not hunt at any time with raptors you use in propagation.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Hacking of propagation raptors.</E> “Hacking” (temporary release to the wild) is an approved method to condition raptors. You may hack a raptor that you produce under your propagation permit.</P>
              <P>(1) You may need permission from your State or tribal wildlife agency to hack a raptor you possess under your propagation permit. Check with your State or tribal agency that regulates falconry to determine if hacking is allowed.</P>
              <P>(2) Any hybrid you hack must have two attached functioning radio transmitters during hacking.</P>

              <P>(3) You may not hack a raptor near a nesting area of a federally threatened or endangered bird species or in any other location where the raptor is likely to harm a federally listed threatened <PRTPAGE P="108"/>or endangered animal species that might be disturbed or taken by your falconry raptor. You should contact your State or territorial wildlife agency before hacking a falconry raptor to ensure that this does not occur. Contact the Fish and Wildlife Service office in your State or territory for information on federally listed species.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Transfer of propagation raptors and offspring if a permittee dies.</E> A surviving spouse, executor, administrator, or other legal representative of a deceased raptor propagation permittee may transfer any bird, eggs, or semen held by the deceased permittee to another authorized permittee within 90 days of the death of the falconry permittee. After 90 days, disposition of a bird held under the permit is at our discretion.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Records of captive propagation efforts.</E> You must maintain complete and accurate records of all operations, including the following, for at least 5 years after the expiration of your permit. However, you may want to retain your records for a longer time if you want to get another migratory bird permit, a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora permit, or a Wild Bird Conservation Act permit.</P>
              <P>(1) The acquisition of raptors, eggs, or semen you acquired from the wild or that were transferred to you.</P>
              <P>(i) What you acquired, and the species, sex, age, and band number of each bird you acquired.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether you acquired the raptor, egg, or semen from the wild or you purchased it or it was transferred to you.</P>
              <P>(2) The disposition of raptors, eggs, or semen you sell or transfer to another permittee. The information should include the band number of raptors you sell or transfer.</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Annual report.</E> You must submit a completed FWS Form 3-202-8 to your Regional Migratory Bird Permit office by January 31 each year for January 1 through December 31 of the preceding year.</P>
              <P>(u) <E T="03">Endangered or threatened species.</E> If you wish to propagate endangered or threatened species, you must have at least 2 years of experience handling raptors in a propagation program or programs. You may also need an endangered species permit to propagate threatened or endangered raptors. See §§ 17.21 and 17.22 of this chapter for permit requirements to propagate threatened or endangered raptors.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Applying for a Federal raptor propagation permit.</E> Using FWS Form 3-200-12, you must submit your application for a raptor propagation permit to the appropriate Regional Director, to the attention of the Migratory Bird Permit Office. You can find addresses for the Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. Your application must contain the general information and the certification required in § 13.12(a) of this chapter, a copy of your State permit authorizing raptor propagation, if your State requires one, and a description (including dimensions), drawings, and photographs of the facilities and equipment you will use.</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Criteria for issuing a permit.</E> When we receive a completed application, we will decide whether we should issue a permit to you. We will consider the general criteria in part 13 of this chapter and the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) You must be at least 18 years old and have at least 2 full years of experience handling raptors.</P>
              <P>(2) You must have a propagation permit or other authorization for raptor propagation from your State or Tribe, if your State or Tribe requires it.</P>
              <P>(3) Your raptor propagation facilities must be adequate for the number and species of raptors to be held under your permit.</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Updating a raptor propagation permit after a move.</E> If you move within your State or get a new mailing address, you must notify us within 30 days (see § 13.23(c) of this chapter). If you move to a new State, within 30 days you must inform both your former and your new (if applicable) Migratory Bird Permit Offices of your address change. If you have new propagation facilities, you must provide information, pictures, and diagrams of them, and they may be inspected in accordance with Federal or State requirements. Thereafter, no mandatory inspections of the facilities will continue.</P>
              <P>(y) <E T="03">Permit expiration.</E> Your Federal permit may be valid for up to 5 years from when it is issued or renewed. It will expire on the same day as your <PRTPAGE P="109"/>State permit, unless your State permit is for a period longer than 5 years, or unless we amend, suspend, or revoke it.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Rehabilitation permits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">What is the permit requirement?</E> Except as provided in § 21.12, a rehabilitation permit is required to take, temporarily possess, or transport any migratory bird for rehabilitation purposes. However, any person who finds a sick, injured, or orphaned migratory bird may, without a permit, take possession of the bird in order to immediately transport it to a permitted rehabilitator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What are the general permit provisions?</E> (1) The permit authorizes you to:</P>
              <P>(i) Take from the wild or receive from another person sick, injured, or orphaned migratory birds and to possess them and provide rehabilitative care for them for up to 180 days;</P>

              <P>(iii) Transfer, release, or euthanize such birds;</P>
              <P>(iv) Transfer or otherwise dispose of dead specimens; and</P>
              <P>(v) Receive, stabilize, and transfer within 48 hours types of migratory bird species not authorized by your permit, in cases of emergency. If a rehabilitator authorized to care for the bird is not available within that timeframe, you must contact the issuing office for authorization to retain the bird until it can be transferred.</P>
              <P>(2) The permit does not authorize the use of migratory birds for educational purposes.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How do I apply for a migratory bird rehabilitation permit?</E> You must apply to the appropriate Regional Director—Attention Migratory Bird Permit Office. You can find addresses for the appropriate Regional Directors in § 2.2 of subchapter A of this chapter. Your application package must consist of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A completed application (Form 3-200-10b);</P>
              <P>(2) A copy of your State rehabilitation permit, license, or other authorization, if one is required in your State; and</P>
              <P>(3) A check or money order made payable to the “U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service” in the amount of the application fee for permits issued under this section listed in § 13.11 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">What criteria will the Service consider before issuing a permit?</E> (1) Upon receiving an application completed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Director will decide whether to issue you a permit based on the general criteria of § 13.21 of this chapter and whether you meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) You must be at least 18 years of age with at least 100 hours of hands-on experience, gained over the course of at least 1 whole year, rehabilitating the types of migratory birds you intend to rehabilitate (e.g., waterbirds, raptors), or comparable experience. Up to 20 hours of the 100-hour time requirement may be fulfilled by participation in migratory bird rehabilitation seminars and courses.</P>
              <P>(ii) Your facilities must be adequate to properly care for the type(s) of migratory bird species you intend to rehabilitate, or you must have a working relationship with a person or organization with such facilities.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must have an agreement with a licensed veterinarian to provide medical care for the birds you intend to rehabilitate, unless you are a licensed veterinarian.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must have a State permit, license, or other authorization to rehabilitate migratory birds if such authorization required by your State.</P>
              <P>(2) In issuing a permit, the Regional Director may place restrictions on the types of migratory bird species you are authorized to rehabilitate, based on your experience and facilities as well as on the specific physical requirements and behavioral traits of particular species.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">What are the standard conditions for this permit?</E> In addition to the general permit conditions set forth in part 13 of this chapter, rehabilitation permits are subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Facilities.</E> You must conduct the activities authorized by this permit in appropriate facilities that are approved <PRTPAGE P="110"/>and identified on the face of your permit. In evaluating whether caging dimensions are adequate, the Service will use as a guideline the standards developed by the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association and the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council (<E T="03">Minimum Standards for Wildlife Rehabilitation, 2000</E>). <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> The Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office will authorize variation from the standards where doing so is reasonable and necessary to accommodate a particular rehabilitator's circumstances, unless a determination is made that such variation will jeopardize migratory birds. However, except as provided by paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, all facilities must adhere to the following criteria:</P>

                <P>

                  <SU>1</SU> Copies may be obtained by contacting either the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association: 14 North 7th Avenue, St. Cloud MN 56303-4766, <E T="03">http://www.nwawildlife.org/default.asp;</E> or the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council: 829 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA 94710, <E T="03">http://www.iwrc-online.org.</E>
                </P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(i) Rehabilitation facilities for migratory birds must be secure and provide protection from predators, domestic animals, undue human disturbance, sun, wind, and inclement weather.</P>
              <P>(ii) Caging must be made of a material that will not entangle or cause injury to the type of birds that will be housed within.</P>
              <P>(iii) Enclosures must be kept clean, well-ventilated, and hygienic.</P>
              <P>(iv) Birds must not be overcrowded, and must be provided enough perches, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(v) Birds must be housed only with compatible migratory bird species.</P>
              <P>(vi) Birds may not be displayed to the public unless you use video equipment, barriers, or other methods to reduce noise and exposure to humans to levels the birds would normally encounter in their habitat. You may not use any equipment for this purpose that causes stress or harm, or impedes the rehabilitation of any bird.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Dietary requirements.</E> You must provide the birds in your care with a diet that is appropriate and nutritionally approximates the natural diet consumed by the species in the wild, with consideration for the age and health of the individual bird.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Subpermittees.</E> Except as provided by paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, anyone who will be performing activities that require permit authorization under paragraph (b)(1) of this section when you or a subpermittee are not present, including any individual who transports birds to or from your facility on a regular basis, must either possess a Federal rehabilitation permit or be authorized as your subpermittee by being named in writing to your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office. This does not apply to General Falconers or Master Falconers, who may assist with conditioning raptors for release without being your subpermittee. If you have a falconer assist in conditioning a rehabilitated raptor for release, you must provide the falconer with a letter or form that identifies the bird and explains that the falconer is assisting in rehabilitation of the raptor.</P>
              <P>(i) Your subpermittees must be at least 18 years of age and possess sufficient experience to tend the species in their care.</P>
              <P>(ii) Your subpermittees who are authorized to care for migratory birds at a site other than your facility must have facilities adequate to house the species in their care, based on the criteria of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. All such facilities except those of a falconer assisting in conditioning raptors for release must be approved by the issuing office.</P>
              <P>(iii) As the primary permittee, you are legally responsible for ensuring that your subpermittees, staff, and volunteers adhere to the terms of your permit when conducting migratory bird rehabilitation activities.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disposition of birds under your care.</E> (i) You must take every precaution to avoid imprinting or habituating birds in your care to humans. If a bird becomes imprinted to humans while under your care, you will be required to transfer the bird as directed by the issuing office.</P>

              <P>(ii) After a bird is rehabilitated to a condition suitable for release to the wild, you must release it to suitable habitat as soon as seasonal conditions allow, except that you may transfer a rehabilitated wild raptor to a holder of a State, tribal, or territorial falconry <PRTPAGE P="111"/>permit if the permit holder is authorized to hold the species for use in falconry. The transfer may need the approval of your State, tribe, or territory. The falconer must complete a Form 3-186A reporting the transfer.</P>
              <P>(A) You may not retain migratory birds longer than 180 days without additional authorization from your Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office. If the appropriate season for release is outside the 180-day timeframe, you must seek authorization from your Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office to possess the bird until the appropriate season.</P>
              <P>(B) Before releasing a threatened or endangered migratory bird, you must comply with any requirements for the release from your Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must euthanize any bird that cannot feed itself, perch upright, or ambulate without inflicting additional injuries to itself where medical and/or rehabilitative care will not reverse such conditions. You must euthanize any bird that is completely blind, and any bird that has sustained injuries that would require amputation of a leg, a foot, or a wing at the elbow or above (humero-ulnar joint) rather than performing such surgery, unless:</P>
              <P>(A) A licensed veterinarian submits a written recommendation that the bird should be kept alive, including an analysis of why the bird is not expected to experience the injuries and/or ailments that typically occur in birds with these injuries and a commitment (from the veterinarian) to provide medical care for the bird for the duration of its life, including complete examinations at least once a year;</P>
              <P>(B) A placement is available for the bird with a person or facility authorized to possess it, where it will receive the veterinary care described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(C) The issuing office specifically authorizes continued possession, medical treatment, and rehabilitative care of the bird.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must obtain authorization from your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office before euthanizing endangered and threatened migratory bird species. In rare cases, the Service may designate a disposition other than euthanasia for those birds. If Service personnel are not available, you may euthanize endangered and threatened migratory birds without Service authorization when prompt euthanasia is warranted by humane consideration for the welfare of the bird.</P>
              <P>(v) You may place nonreleasable live birds that are suitable for use in educational programs, foster parenting, research projects, or other permitted activities with persons permitted or otherwise authorized to possess such birds, with prior approval from your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office.</P>
              <P>(vi)(A) You may donate dead birds and parts thereof, except threatened and endangered species, and bald and golden eagles, to persons authorized by permit to possess migratory bird specimens or exempted from permit requirements under § 21.12.</P>
              <P>(B) You must obtain approval from your issuing office before disposing of or transferring any live or dead endangered or threatened migratory bird specimen, parts, or feathers.</P>
              <P>(C) You must send all dead bald and golden eagles, and their parts and feathers to: National Eagle Repository, Building 128, Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Commerce City, CO 80022. If your State requires you to notify State wildlife officers of a dead bald or golden eagle before sending the eagle to the Repository you must comply with State regulations. States may assume temporary possession of the carcasses for purposes of necropsy.</P>
              <P>(D) Unless specifically required to do otherwise by the Service, you must promptly destroy all other dead specimens by such means as are necessary to prevent any exposure of the specimens to animals in the wild.</P>
              <P>(vii) With authorization from your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office, you may hold a nonreleasable bird longer than 180 days for the purpose of fostering juveniles during their rehabilitation. You may also use birds you possess under an educational permit to foster juveniles.</P>

              <P>(viii) You may possess a reasonable number of feathers for imping purposes, based on the numbers and species of birds for which you regularly provide care.<PRTPAGE P="112"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ix) You may draw blood and take other medical samples for purposes of the diagnosis and recovery of birds under your care, or for transfer to authorized facilities conducting research pertaining to a contagious disease or other public health hazard.</P>
              <P>(x) You may conduct necropsies on dead specimens in your possession, except that you must obtain approval from your Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office before conducting necropsies on threatened or endangered species.</P>
              <P>(xi) This permit does not confer ownership of any migratory bird. All birds held under this permit remain under the stewardship of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Notification to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</E> (i) You must notify your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office within 24 hours of acquiring a threatened or endangered migratory bird species, or bald or golden eagle, whether live or dead. You may be required to transfer these birds to another facility designated by the Service.</P>

              <P>(ii) You must immediately notify the local U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Office if you have reason to believe a bird has been poisoned, electrocuted, shot, or otherwise subjected to criminal activity. Contact information for your local Service Law Enforcement office is listed on your permit, or you can obtain it on the Internet at <E T="03">http://offices.fws.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) If the sickness, injury, or death of any bird is due or likely due to avian virus, or other contagious disease or public health hazard, you must notify and comply with the instructions given by the State or local authority that is responsible for tracking the suspected disease or hazard in your location, if that agency is currently collecting such information from the public.</P>
              <P>(6) You must maintain a working relationship with a licensed veterinarian. If your working relationship with your original cooperating veterinarian is dissolved, you must establish an agreement within 30 days with another licensed veterinarian to provide medical services to the birds in your care, and furnish a copy of this agreement to the issuing office.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> You must maintain complete and accurate records of all migratory birds that you receive, including for each bird the date received, type of injury or illness, disposition, and date of disposition. You must retain these records for 5 years following the end of the calendar year covered by the records.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Annual report.</E> You must submit an annual report that includes the information required by paragraph (e)(7) for the preceding calendar year to your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office by the date required on your permit. You may complete Service Form 3-202-4, or submit your annual report from a database you maintain, provided your report contains all, and only, the information required by Form 3-202-4.</P>
              <P>(9) At the discretion of the Regional Director, we may stipulate on the face of your permit additional conditions compatible with the permit conditions set forth in this section, to place limits on numbers and/or types of birds you may possess under your permit, to stipulate authorized location(s) for your rehabilitation activities, or otherwise specify permitted activities, based on your experience and facilities.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">How does this permit apply to oil and hazardous waste spills?</E> Prior to entering the location of an oil or hazardous material spill, you must obtain authorization from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Response Coordinator or other designated Service representative and obtain permission from the On-Scene Coordinator. All activities within the location of the spill are subject to the authority of the On-Scene Coordinator. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for the disposition of all migratory birds, dead or alive.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Permit provisions in oil or hazardous material spills.</E> (i) In addition to the rehabilitation permit provisions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, when under the authority of the designated U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service representative this permit further authorizes you to temporarily possess healthy, unaffected birds for the purpose of removing them from imminent danger.</P>

              <P>(ii) This permit does not authorize salvage of dead migratory birds. When <PRTPAGE P="113"/>dead migratory birds are discovered, a Service law enforcement officer must be notified immediately in order to coordinate the handling and collection of evidence. Contact information for your local Service Law Enforcement office is listed on your permit and on the Internet at <E T="03">http://offices.fws.gov.</E> The designated Service representative will have direct control and responsibility over all live migratory birds, and will coordinate the collection, storage, and handling of any dead migratory birds with the Service's Division of Law Enforcement.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must notify your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office of any migratory birds in your possession within 24 hours of removing such birds from the area.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Conditions specific to oil and hazardous waste spills</E>—(i) <E T="03">Facilities.</E> Facilities used at the scene of oil or hazardous waste spills may be temporary and/or mobile, and may provide less space and protection from noise and disturbance than facilities authorized under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Such facilities should conform as closely as possible with the facility specifications contained in the Service policy titled <E T="03">Best Practices for Migratory Bird Care During Oil Spill Response.</E>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Subpermittees.</E> In cases of oil and hazardous waste spills, persons who assist with cleaning or treating migratory birds at the on-scene facility will not be required to have a rehabilitation permit or be a subpermittee; however, volunteers must be trained in rescue protocol for migratory birds affected by oil and hazardous waste spills. A permit (or subpermittee designation) is required to perform extended rehabilitation of such birds, after initial cleaning and treating, at a subsequent location.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Will I also need a permit from the State in which I live?</E> If your State requires a license, permit, or other authorization to rehabilitate migratory birds, your Federal migratory bird rehabilitation permit will not be valid if you do not also possess and adhere to the terms of the required State authorization, in addition to the Federal permit. Nothing in this section prevents a State from making and enforcing laws or regulations consistent with this section that are more restrictive or give further protection to migratory birds.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">How long is a migratory bird rehabilitation permit valid?</E> Your rehabilitation permit will expire on the date designated on the face of the permit unless amended or revoked. No rehabilitation permit will have a term exceeding 5 years.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Control order for resident Canada geese at airports and military airfields.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Which Canada geese are covered by this order?</E> This regulation addresses the control and management of resident Canada geese, as defined in § 21.3.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What is the control order for resident Canada geese at airports, and what is its purpose?</E> The airport control order authorizes managers at commercial, public, and private airports (airports) (and their employees or their agents) and military air operation facilities (military airfields) (and their employees or their agents) to establish and implement a control and management program when necessary to resolve or <PRTPAGE P="118"/>prevent threats to public safety from resident Canada geese. Control and management activities include indirect and/or direct control strategies such as trapping and relocation, nest and egg destruction, gosling and adult trapping and culling programs, or other lethal and non-lethal control strategies.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Who may participate in the program?</E> To be designated as an airport that is authorized to participate in this program, an airport must be part of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems and have received Federal grant-in-aid assistance, or a military airfield, meaning an airfield or air station that is under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the Secretary of a military department. Only airports and military airfields in the lower 48 States and the District of Columbia are eligible to conduct and implement the various resident Canada goose control and management program components.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">What are the restrictions of the control order for resident Canada geese at airports and military airfields?</E> The airport control order for resident Canada geese is subject to the following restrictions:</P>
              <P>(1) Airports and military airfields should use nonlethal goose management tools to the extent they deem appropriate. To minimize lethal take, airports and military airfields should follow this procedure:</P>
              <P>(i) Assess the problem to determine its extent or magnitude, its impact on current operations, and the appropriate control method to be used.</P>
              <P>(ii) Base control methods on sound biological, environmental, social, and cultural factors.</P>
              <P>(iii) Formulate appropriate methods into a control strategy that uses several control techniques rather than relying on a single method.</P>
              <P>(iv) Implement all appropriate nonlethal management techniques (such as harassment and habitat modification) in conjunction with take authorized under this order.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Methods of take for the control of resident Canada geese are at the airport's and military airfield's discretion from among the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Egg oiling,</P>
              <P>(B) Egg and nest destruction,</P>
              <P>(C) Shooting,</P>

              <P>(ii) Birds caught live may be euthanized or transported and relocated to another site approved by the State or Tribal wildlife agency, if required.</P>
              <P>(iii) All techniques used must be in accordance with other Federal, State, and local laws, and their use must comply with any labeling restrictions.</P>
              <P>(iv) Persons using shotguns must use nontoxic shot, as listed in § 20.21(j) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(v) Persons using egg oiling must use 100 percent corn oil, a substance exempted from regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.</P>
              <P>(3) Airports and military airfields may conduct management and control activities, involving the take of resident Canada geese, under this section between April 1 and September 15. The destruction of resident Canada goose nests and eggs may take place at any time of year.</P>

              <P>(4) Airports and military airfields and their employees and agents may possess, transport, and otherwise dispose of resident Canada geese taken under this section. Disposal of birds taken under this order may be by donation to public museums or public institutions for scientific or educational purposes, processing for human consumption and subsequent distribution free of charge to charitable organizations, or burial or incineration. Airports/military airfields, their employees, and designated agents may not sell, offer for sale, barter, or ship for the purpose of sale or barter any resident Canada geese taken under this section, nor their plumage or eggs. Any specimens needed for scientific purposes as determined by the Regional Director must not be destroyed, and information on birds carrying metal leg bands must be submitted to the Bird Banding Laboratory by means of a toll-free telephone number at 1-800-327-BAND (or 2263).<PRTPAGE P="119"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Resident Canada geese may be taken only within the airport, or the military base on which a military airfield is located, or within a 3-mile radius of the outer boundary of such a facility. Airports and military airfields or their agents must first obtain all necessary authorizations from landowners for all management activities conducted outside the airport or military airfield's boundaries and be in compliance with all State and local laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(6) Nothing in this section authorizes the killing of resident Canada geese or destruction of their nests and eggs contrary to the laws or regulations of any State or Tribe, and none of the privileges of this section may be exercised unless the airport or military airfield possesses the appropriate State or Tribal authorization or other permits required by the State or Tribe. Moreover, this section does not authorize the killing of any migratory bird species or destruction of their nest or eggs other than resident Canada geese.</P>
              <P>(7) Authorized airports and military airfields, and their employees and agents operating under the provisions of this section may not use decoys, calls, or other devices to lure birds within gun range.</P>
              <P>(8) Airports and military airfields exercising the privileges granted by this section must submit an annual report summarizing activities, including the date and numbers and location of birds, nests, and eggs taken, by December 31 of each year to the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office listed in § 2.2 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(9) Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land without written permission of the Federal agency with jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(10) Airports and military airfields may not undertake any actions under this section if the activities adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered Species Act. Persons operating under this order must immediately report the take of any species protected under the Endangered Species Act to the Service. Further, to protect certain species from being adversely affected by management actions, airports and military airfields must:</P>

The criteria and procedures for suspension, revocation, reconsideration, and appeal are outlined in §§ 13.27 through 13.29 of this subchapter. For the purposes of this section, “issuing officer” means the Regional Director and “permit” means the authority to act under this depredation order. For purposes of § 13.29(e), appeals must be made to the Director. Additionally, at such time that we determine that resident Canada geese populations no longer pose a threat to agricultural crops or no longer need to be reduced in order to resolve or prevent injury to agricultural crops or other agricultural interests, we may choose to terminate part or all of the depredation order by subsequent regulation. In all cases, we will annually review the necessity and effectiveness of the depredation order.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Public health control order for resident Canada geese.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Which Canada geese are covered by this order?</E> This regulation addresses the control and management of resident Canada geese, as defined in § 21.3.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What is the public health control order for resident Canada geese, and what is its purpose?</E> The public health control order for resident Canada geese authorizes States, Tribes, and the District of Columbia, via the State or Tribal wildlife agency, to conduct resident Canada goose control and management activities including direct control strategies such as trapping and relocation, nest and egg destruction, gosling and adult trapping and culling programs, or other lethal and non-lethal wildlife damage-management strategies when resident Canada geese are posing a direct threat to human health.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What is a direct threat to human health?</E> A direct threat to human health is one where a Federal, State, Tribal, or local public health agency has determined that resident Canada geese pose a specific, immediate human health threat by creating conditions conducive to the transmission of human or zoonotic pathogens. The State or Tribe may not use this control order for situations in which resident Canada geese are merely causing a nuisance.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Who may participate in the program?</E> Only State and Tribal wildlife agencies in the lower 48 States and the District of Columbia (or their employees or agents) may conduct and implement the various components of the public health control order for resident Canada geese.<PRTPAGE P="125"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">What are the restrictions of the public health depredation order for resident Canada geese?</E> The public health control order for resident Canada geese is subject to the following restrictions:</P>
              <P>(1) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies should use nonlethal goose management tools to the extent they deem appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Methods of take for the control of resident Canada geese are at the State's and Tribe's discretion from among the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Egg oiling,</P>
              <P>(B) Egg and nest destruction,</P>
              <P>(C) Shotguns,</P>
              <P>(D) Lethal and live traps,</P>

              <P>(G) Cervical dislocation, and</P>
              <P>(H) CO<E T="52">2</E> asphyxiation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Birds caught live may be euthanized or transported and relocated to another site approved by the State or Tribal wildlife agency, if required.</P>
              <P>(iii) All techniques used must be in accordance with other Federal, State, Tribal, and local laws, and their use must comply with any labeling restrictions.</P>
              <P>(iv) Persons using shotguns must use nontoxic shot, as listed in § 20.21(j) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(v) Persons using egg oiling must use 100 percent corn oil, a substance exempted from regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.</P>
              <P>(3) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies and their employees and agents may conduct management and control activities, involving the take of resident Canada geese, under this section between April 1 and August 31. The destruction of resident Canada goose nests and eggs may take place at any time of year.</P>
              <P>(4) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies and their employees and agents may possess, transport, and otherwise dispose of resident Canada geese taken under this section. Disposal of birds taken under this order may be by donation to public museums or public institutions for scientific or educational purposes, processing for human consumption and subsequent distribution free of charge to charitable organizations, or burial or incineration. States, their employees, and designated agents may not sell, offer for sale, barter, or ship for the purpose of sale or barter any resident Canada geese taken under this section, nor their plumage or eggs. Any specimens needed for scientific purposes as determined by the Regional Director must not be destroyed, and information on birds carrying metal leg bands must be submitted to the Bird Banding Laboratory by means of a toll-free telephone number at 1-800-327-BAND (or 2263).</P>

No person may exercise the privileges granted under this section unless they possess any permits required for such activities by any State or Federal land manager.</P>

              <P>(8) Any State or Tribal employee or designated agent authorized to carry out activities under this section must have a copy of the State's or Tribal authorization and designation in their possession when carrying out any activities. If the State or Tribe is conducting operations on private property, the State or Tribe must also require the property owner or occupant on whose premises resident Canada goose activities are being conducted to allow, at all reasonable times, including during actual operations, free and unrestricted access to any Service special agent or refuge officer, State or Tribal wildlife or deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or other wildlife law enforcement officer on the premises <PRTPAGE P="126"/>where they are, or were, conducting activities. Furthermore, any State or Tribal employee or designated agent conducting such activities must promptly furnish whatever information is required concerning such activities to any such wildlife officer.</P>
              <P>(9) States and Tribes exercising the privileges granted by this section must submit an annual report summarizing activities, including the numbers and County of birds taken, by December 31 of each year to the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office listed in § 2.2 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(10) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies may not undertake any actions under this section if the activities adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered Species Act.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">What is a conservation order?</E> A conservation order is a special management action that is needed to control certain wildlife populations when traditional management programs are unsuccessful in preventing overabundance <PRTPAGE P="130"/>of the population. We are authorizing a conservation order under the authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to reduce and stabilize various light goose populations. The conservation order allows new methods of taking light geese, allows shooting hours for light geese to end one-half hour after sunset, and imposes no daily bag limits for light geese inside or outside the migratory bird hunting season frameworks as described in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Which waterfowl species are covered by the order?</E> The conservation order addresses management of greater snow (<E T="03">Chen caerulescens atlantica</E>), lesser snow (<E T="03">C. c. caerulescens</E>), and Ross's (<E T="03">C. rossii</E>) geese that breed, migrate, and winter in North America. The term light geese refers collectively to greater and lesser snow geese and Ross's geese.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Where can the conservation order be authorized?</E> The Director can authorize the conservation order in these areas:</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">When will the Director authorize the conservation order in a particular Flyway?</E> (1) The Director may authorize the conservation order for the reduction of greater snow geese for any State or Tribe contained within the Atlantic Flyway by publishing a notice under paragraph (e) of this section when the May Waterfowl Population Status report indicates that the management goal of 500,000 birds has been exceeded and that special conservation actions conducted in Canada are insufficient to reduce the population. Authorization of the conservation order in the U.S. portion of the Atlantic Flyway will occur after the Director determines the degree to which the management goal has been exceeded, the trajectory of population growth, anticipated harvest that would result from implementation of the conservation order, and whether or not similar conservation actions will be conducted in Canada.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director may authorize the conservation order for the reduction of mid-continent light geese (lesser snow and Ross's geese) for any State or Tribe contained within the Mississippi and Central Flyways by publishing a notice under paragraph (e) of this section when the May Waterfowl Population Status report indicates that the management goal of 1,600,000 birds (winter index for Mid-continent Population and Western Central Flyway Population, combined) has been exceeded. Authorization of the conservation order in the U.S. portion of the Mississippi and Central Flyways will occur after the Director determines the degree to which the management goal has been exceeded, the trajectory of population growth, anticipated harvest that would result from implementation of the conservation order, and whether or not similar conservation actions will be conducted in Canada.</P>
              <P>(3) The Director may authorize a conservation order for the reduction of light geese (lesser snow and Ross's geese) for any State or Tribe contained within the Pacific Flyway by publishing a notice under paragraph (e) of this section when the Director determines that light goose numbers in the western Arctic have exceeded the ability of their breeding habitat to support them.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">How will the conservation order be authorized for a particular Flyway?</E> The Director will publish a notice in the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>
                <E T="04">Federal Register</E> when the conservation order is authorized in a particular Flyway.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">What is required for State/Tribal governments to participate in the conservation order?</E> When authorized by the Director, any State or Tribal government responsible for the management of wildlife and migratory birds may, without permit, kill or cause to be killed under its general supervision, light geese under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) Activities conducted under the conservation order may not affect endangered or threatened species as designated under the Endangered Species Act.</P>
              <P>(2) Control activities must be conducted clearly as such and are intended to relieve pressures on migratory birds and habitat essential to migratory bird populations only and are not to be construed as opening, reopening, or extending any open hunting season contrary to any regulations promulgated under Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</P>
              <P>(3) Control activities may be conducted only when all waterfowl (including light goose) and crane hunting seasons, excluding falconry, are closed.</P>
              <P>(4) Control measures employed through this section may be used only between the hours of one-half hour before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset.</P>
              <P>(5) Nothing in the conservation order may limit or initiate management actions on Federal land without concurrence of the Federal agency with jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(6) States and Tribes must designate participants who must operate under the conditions of the conservation order.</P>
              <P>(7) States and Tribes must inform participants of the requirements and conditions of the conservation order that apply.</P>
              <P>(8) States and tribes must keep annual records of activities carried out under the authority of the conservation order. Specifically, information must be collected on:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of persons participating in the conservation order;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of days people participated in the conservation order;</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of light geese shot and retrieved under the conservation order; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The number of light geese shot but not retrieved.</P>
              <P>(9) The States and Tribes must submit an annual report summarizing activities conducted under the conservation order on or before September 15 of each year, to the Chief, Division of Migratory Bird Management, at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b). Information from Tribes may be incorporated in State reports.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">What is required for persons to participate in the conservation order?</E> Individual participants in State or Tribal programs covered by the conservation order must comply with the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) Nothing in the conservation order authorizes the take of light geese contrary to any State or Tribal laws or regulations, and none of the privileges granted under the conservation order may be exercised unless persons acting under the authority of the conservation order possess whatever permit or other authorization(s) may be required for such activities by the State or Tribal government concerned.</P>
              <P>(2) Persons who take light geese under the conservation order may not sell or offer for sale those birds or their plumage but may possess, transport, and otherwise properly use them.</P>
              <P>(3) Persons acting under the authority of the conservation order must permit at all reasonable times, including during actual operations, any Federal or State game or deputy game agent, warden, protector, or other game law enforcement officer free and unrestricted access over the premises on which such operations have been or are being conducted and must promptly furnish whatever information an officer requires concerning the operation.</P>
              <P>(4) Persons acting under the authority of the conservation order may take light geese by any method except those prohibited as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) With a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, shotgun larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine gun, fish hook, poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying substance.</P>

              <P>(ii) From or by means, aid, or use of a sinkbox or any other type of low <PRTPAGE P="132"/>floating device having a depression affording the person a means of concealment beneath the surface of the water.</P>
              <P>(iii) From or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor-driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegics and persons missing one or both legs may carry out take activities from any stationary motor vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance.</P>
              <P>(iv) From or by means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor attached, or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off and the sails furled, and its progress has ceased. A craft under power may be used only to retrieve dead or crippled birds; however, the craft may not be used under power to shoot any crippled bird.</P>
              <P>(v) By the use or aid of live birds as decoys. It is a violation of this paragraph (g) for any person to take light geese on an area where tame or captive live geese are present unless such birds are and have been for a period of 10 consecutive days before the taking, confined within an enclosure that substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally conceals the birds from the sight of light geese.</P>
              <P>(vi) By means or aid of any motor-driven land, water, or air conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or resulting in the concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of light geese.</P>
              <P>(vii) By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where a person knows or reasonably should know that the area is or has been baited as described in § 20.11(j-k). Light geese may not be taken on or over lands or areas that are baited areas, and where grain or other feed has been distributed or scattered solely as the result of manipulation of an agricultural crop or other feed on the land where grown, or solely as the result of a normal agricultural operation as described in § 20.11(h) and (l). However, nothing in this paragraph (g) prohibits the taking of light geese on or over the following lands or areas that are not otherwise baited areas:</P>
              <P>(A) Standing crops or flooded standing crops (including aquatics); standing, flooded, or manipulated natural vegetation; flooded harvested croplands; or lands or areas where seeds or grains have been scattered solely as the result of a normal agricultural planting, harvesting, postharvest manipulation or normal soil stabilization practice as described in § 20.11(g), (i), (l), and (m);</P>
              <P>(B) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with natural vegetation;</P>
              <P>(C) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with vegetation from agricultural crops, as long as such camouflaging does not result in the exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of grain or other feed; or</P>
              <P>(D) Standing or flooded standing agricultural crops where grain is inadvertently scattered solely as a result of a hunter entering or exiting a hunting area, placing decoys, or retrieving downed birds.</P>
              <P>(viii) Participants may not possess shot (either in shotshells or as loose shot for muzzleloading) other than steel shot, bismuth-tin, tungsten-iron, tungsten-polymer, tungsten-matrix, tungsten-bronze, tungsten-nickel-iron, tungsten-tin-iron, tungsten-nickel-iron-tin, tungsten-iron-copper-nickel, or other shots that are authorized in § 20.21(j).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Can the conservation order be suspended?</E> The Director reserves the right to suspend or revoke a State's or Tribe's authority under the conservation order if we find that the State or Tribe has not adhered to the terms and conditions specified in this section. The criteria for suspension and revocation are outlined in § 13.27 and § 13.28 of this subchapter. Upon appeal, final decisions to revoke authority will be made by the Director. Additionally, at such time that the Director determines that a specific population of light geese no longer poses a threat to habitats, agricultural crops, or other interests, or is within Flyway management objectives, the Director may choose to terminate part or all of the conservation order.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Under what conditions would the conservation order be suspended?</E> The Director will annually assess the overall impact and effectiveness of the conservation order on each light goose population to ensure compatibility <PRTPAGE P="133"/>with long-term conservation of this resource. The Director will suspend the conservation order if at any time evidence clearly demonstrates that an individual light goose population no longer presents a serious threat of injury to the area or areas involved. Suspension by the Director will occur by publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> However, resumption of growth by the light goose population in question may warrant reinstatement of the conservation order to control the population. The Director will publish a notice of such reinstatement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Depending on the status of individual light goose populations, it is possible that a conservation order may be in effect for one or more light goose populations, but not others.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">What are the information collection requirements?</E> The information collection requirements associated with the conservation order are described in paragraphs (f)(6) through (9) of this section. Reported information helps us to assess the effectiveness of light geese population control methods and strategies and assess whether or not additional population control methods are needed. The Office of Management and Budget has approved this information collection and assigned OMB Control No. 1018-0103. We may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. At any time, you may submit comments on these information collection requirements to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Population control of resident Canada geese.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Which Canada geese are covered by this regulation?</E> This regulation addresses the population control of resident Canada geese, as defined in § 21.3.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What is the resident Canada goose population control program, and what is its purpose?</E> The resident Canada goose population control program is a managed take program implemented under the authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to reduce and stabilize resident Canada goose populations when traditional and otherwise authorized management measures are unsuccessful, not feasible for dealing with, or applicable, in preventing injury to property, agricultural crops, public health, and other interests from resident Canada geese. The Director is authorized to allow States and Tribes to implement a population control, or managed take, program to remedy these injuries. When authorized by the Director, managed take allows additional methods of taking resident Canada geese, allows shooting hours for resident Canada geese to extend to one-half hour after sunset, and removes daily bag limits for resident Canada geese inside or outside the migratory bird hunting season frameworks as described in this section. The intent of the program is to reduce resident Canada goose populations in order to protect personal property and agricultural crops and other interests from injury and to resolve potential concerns about human health. The management and control activities allowed or conducted under the program are intended to relieve or prevent damage and injurious situations. No person should construe this program as opening, reopening, or extending any hunting season contrary to any regulations established under section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What areas are eligible to participate in the program?</E> When approved by the Director, the State and Tribal wildlife agencies of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming may implement the resident Canada goose population control program components in the Atlantic, Central, and Mississippi Flyway portions of these States.<PRTPAGE P="134"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">What is required in order for State governments to participate in a managed take program?</E> Following the conclusion of the first full operational year of §§ 21.49 through 21.52 of this part, any wildlife agency from a State listed in 21.61(c) may request approval for the population control program. A request must include a discussion of the State's or Tribe's efforts to address its injurious situations utilizing the methods approved in this rule or a discussion of the reasons why the methods authorized by these rules are not feasible for dealing with, or applicable to, the injurious situations that require further action. Discussions should be detailed and provide the Service with a clear understanding of the injuries that continue, why the authorized methods utilized have not worked, and why methods not utilized could not effectuate resolution of the injuries. A State's request for approval may be for an area or areas smaller than the entire State. Upon written approval by the Director, any State or Tribal government responsible for the management of wildlife and migratory birds may, without permit, kill or cause to be killed under its general supervision, resident Canada geese under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) Activities conducted under the managed take program may not affect endangered or threatened species as designated under the Endangered Species Act.</P>
              <P>(2) Control activities may be conducted under this section only between August 1 and August 31.</P>
              <P>(3) Control measures employed through this section may be implemented only between the hours of one-half hour before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset.</P>
              <P>(4) Nothing in the program may limit or initiate management actions on Federal land without concurrence of the Federal agency with jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(5) States and Tribes must designate participants who must operate under the conditions of the managed take program.</P>
              <P>(6) States and Tribes must inform participants of the requirements/conditions of the program that apply.</P>
              <P>(7) States and Tribes must keep annual records of activities carried out under the authority of the program. Specifically, information must be collected on:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of individuals participating in the program;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of days individuals participated in the program;</P>
              <P>(iii) The total number of resident Canada geese shot and retrieved during the program; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The number of resident Canada geese shot but not retrieved. The States and Tribes must submit an annual report summarizing activities conducted under the program and an assessment of the continuation of the injuries on or before June 1 of each year to the Chief, Division of Migratory Bird Management, at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">What is required for individuals to participate in the program?</E> Individual participants in State and Tribal programs covered by the managed take program must comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Participants must comply with all applicable State and Tribal laws or regulations including possession of whatever permit(s) or other authorization(s) may be required by the State or Tribal government concerned.</P>
              <P>(2) Participants who take resident Canada geese under the program may not sell or offer for sale those birds or their plumage, but may possess, transport, and otherwise properly use them.</P>
              <P>(3) Participants must permit at all reasonable times, including during actual operations, any Service special agent or refuge officer, State or Tribal wildlife or deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or other wildlife law enforcement officer free and unrestricted access over the premises on which such operations have been or are being conducted and must promptly furnish whatever information an officer requires concerning the operation.</P>
              <P>(4) Participants may take resident Canada geese by any method except those prohibited as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) With a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, shotgun larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine gun, fish hook, poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying substance.</P>

              <P>(ii) From or by means, aid, or use of a sinkbox or any other type of low-<PRTPAGE P="135"/>floating device, having a depression affording the person a means of concealment beneath the surface of the water.</P>
              <P>(iii) From or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor-driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegic persons and persons missing one or both legs may take from any stationary motor vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance.</P>
              <P>(iv) From or by means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor attached, or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off and the sails furled, and its progress has ceased. A craft under power may be used only to retrieve dead or crippled birds; however, the craft may not be used under power to shoot any crippled birds.</P>
              <P>(v) By the use or aid of live birds as decoys. No person may take resident Canada geese on an area where tame or captive live geese are present unless such birds are, and have been for a period of 10 consecutive days before the taking, confined within an enclosure that substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally conceals the birds from the sight of resident Canada geese.</P>
              <P>(vi) By means or aid of any motor-driven land, water, or air conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or resulting in the concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of resident Canada geese.</P>
              <P>(vii) By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where a person knows or reasonably should know that the area is or has been baited as described in § 20.11(j) and (k) of this part. Resident Canada geese may not be taken on or over lands or areas that are baited areas, and where grain or other feed has been distributed or scattered solely as the result of manipulation of an agricultural crop or other feed on the land where grown, or solely as the result of a normal agricultural operation as described in § 20.11(h) and (l) of this part. However, nothing in this paragraph prohibits the taking of resident Canada geese on or over the following lands or areas that are not otherwise baited areas:</P>
              <P>(A) Standing crops or flooded standing crops (including aquatics); standing, flooded, or manipulated natural vegetation; flooded harvested croplands; or lands or areas where seeds or grains have been scattered solely as the result of a normal agricultural planting, harvesting, post-harvest manipulation or normal soil stabilization practice as described in § 20.11(g), (i), (l), and (m) of this part;</P>
              <P>(B) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with natural vegetation;</P>
              <P>(C) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with vegetation from agricultural crops, as long as such camouflaging does not result in the exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of grain or other feed; or</P>
              <P>(D) Standing or flooded standing agricultural crops where grain is inadvertently scattered solely as a result of a hunter entering or exiting a hunting area, placing decoys, or retrieving downed birds.</P>
              <P>(E) Participants may not possess shot (either in shotshells or as loose shot for muzzleloading) other than steel shot, bismuth-tin, tungsten-iron, tungsten-polymer, tungsten-matrix, tungsten-nickel iron, or other shots that are authorized in § 20.21(j) of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Under what conditions would we suspend the managed take program?</E> Following authorization by the Director, we will annually assess the overall impact and effectiveness of the program on resident Canada goose populations to ensure compatibility with long-term conservation of this resource. If at any time evidence is presented that clearly demonstrates that resident Canada geese populations no longer need to be reduced in order to allow resolution or prevention of injury to people, property, agricultural crops, or other interests, the Director, in writing, will suspend the program for the resident Canada goose population in question. However, resumption of injuries caused by growth of the population and not otherwise addressable by the methods available in part 21 may warrant reinstatement of such regulations. A State must reapply for approval, including the same information and discussions noted in 21.61(d). Depending on the location of the injury or threat or injury, the Director, in writing, may suspend <PRTPAGE P="136"/>or reinstate this authorization for one or more resident Canada goose populations, but not others.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">What population information is the State or Tribe required to collect concerning the resident Canada goose managed take program?</E> Participating States and Tribes must provide an annual estimate of the breeding population and distribution of resident Canada geese in their State. The States and Tribes must submit this estimate on or before August 1 of each year, to the Chief, Division of Migratory Bird Management, at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">What are the general program conditions and restrictions?</E> The program is subject to the conditions elsewhere in this section, and, unless otherwise specifically authorized, the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land within a State's or Tribe's boundaries without written permission of the Federal agency with jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(2) States may not undertake any actions under this section if the activities adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered Species Act. Persons operating under this section must immediately report the take of any species protected under the Endangered Species Act to the Service. Further, to protect certain species from being adversely affected by management actions, States must:</P>
              <P>(i) Follow the Federal State Contingency Plan for the whooping crane;</P>
              <P>(ii) Conduct no activities within 300 meters of a whooping crane or Mississippi sandhill crane nest; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Follow all Regional (or National when available) Bald Eagle Nesting Management guidelines for all management activities.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Has the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information collection requirements of the program?</E> OMB has approved the information collection and recordkeeping requirements of the program under OMB control number 1018-0133. We may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. You may send comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</P>

              <P>You may not take, possess, or transport any bald eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>) or any golden eagle (<E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>), or the parts, nests, or eggs of such birds, except as allowed by a valid permit issued under this part, 50 CFR part 13, 50 CFR part 17, and/or 50 CFR part 21 as provided by § 21.2, or authorized under a depredation order issued under subpart D of this part. We will accept a single application for a permit under this part and any other parts of this subchapter B if it includes all of the information required for an application under each applicable part.</P>
              <P>(a) A permit that covers take of bald eagles or golden eagles under 50 CFR part 17 for purposes of providing prospective or current ESA authorization constitutes a valid permit issued under this part for any take authorized under the permit issued under part 17 as long as the permittee is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit issued under part 17. The provisions of part 17 that originally applied will apply for purposes of the Eagle Act authorization, except that the criterion for revocation of the permit is that the activity is incompatible with the preservation of the bald eagle or the golden eagle rather than inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv).</P>
              <P>(b) You do not need a permit under parts 17 and 21 of this subchapter B for any activity permitted under this part 22 with respect to bald or golden eagles or their parts, nests, or eggs.</P>
              <P>(c) A permit under this part only authorizes take, possession, and/or transport under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and does not provide authorization under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Endangered Species Act for the take, possession, and/or transport of migratory birds or endangered or threatened species other than bald or golden eagles.</P>
              <P>(d) If you are transporting dead bald or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or dead eggs into or out of the United States, you will also need a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) permit under part 23 of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> This permit authorizes take of bald eagles and golden eagles where the take is compatible with the preservation of the bald eagle and the golden eagle; is necessary to protect an interest in a particular locality; is associated with, but not the purpose of, the activity; and cannot practicably be avoided.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> In addition to the definitions contained in part 10 of this subchapter, and § 22.3, the following definition applies in this section:</P>

                <E T="03">Eagle</E> means a live bald eagle (<E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>), live golden eagle (<E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>), a bald eagle egg, or a golden eagle egg.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Permit conditions.</E> In addition to the conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, which govern permit renewal, amendment, transfer, suspension, revocation, and other procedures and requirements for all permits issued by the Service, your authorization is subject to the following additional conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) You must comply with all avoidance, minimization, or other mitigation measures specified in the terms of your permit to mitigate for the detrimental effects on eagles, including indirect and cumulative effects, of the permitted take.</P>
              <P>(i) Compensatory mitigation scaled to project impacts will be required for any permit authorizing take that would exceed the applicable eagle management unit take limits. Compensatory mitigation for this purpose must ensure the preservation of the affected eagle species by reducing another ongoing form of mortality by an amount equal to or greater than the unavoidable mortality, or increasing the eagle population by an equal or greater amount.</P>
              <P>(ii) Compensatory mitigation may also be required in the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(A) When cumulative authorized take, including the proposed take, would exceed 5 percent of the local area population; or</P>
              <P>(B) When available data indicate that cumulative unauthorized mortality would exceed 10 percent of the local area population.</P>
              <P>(iii) All required compensatory mitigation must:</P>
              <P>(A) Be determined based on application of all practicable avoidance and minimization measures;</P>
              <P>(B) Be sited within the same eagle management unit where the permitted take will occur unless the Service has reliable data showing that the population affected by the take includes individuals that are reasonably likely to use another eagle management unit during part of their seasonal migration;</P>
              <P>(C) Use the best available science in formulating and monitoring the long-term effectiveness of mitigation measures and use rigorous compliance and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation to make certain that mitigation measures achieve their intended outcomes, or that necessary changes are implemented to achieve them;</P>
              <P>(D) Be additional and improve upon the baseline conditions of the affected eagle species in a manner that is demonstrably new and would not have occurred without the compensatory mitigation (voluntary actions taken in anticipation of meeting compensatory mitigation requirements for an eagle take permit not yet granted may be credited toward compensatory mitigation requirements);</P>
              <P>(E) Be durable and, at a minimum, maintain its intended purpose for as long as impacts of the authorized take persist; and</P>
              <P>(F) Include mechanisms to account for and address uncertainty and risk of failure of a compensatory mitigation measure.</P>

              <P>(iv) Compensatory mitigation may include conservation banking, in-lieu fee programs, and other third-party mitigation projects or arrangements. Permittee-responsible mitigation may be approved provided the permittee <PRTPAGE P="146"/>submits verifiable documentation sufficient to demonstrate that the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section have been met and the alternative means of compensatory mitigation will offset the permitted take to the degree that is compatible with the preservation of eagles.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> (i) You may be required to monitor impacts to eagles from the permitted activity for up to 3 years after completion of the activity or as set forth in a separate management plan, as specified on your permit. For ongoing activities and enduring site features that will likely continue to cause take, periodic monitoring will be required for as long as the data are needed to assess impacts to eagles.</P>
              <P>(ii) The frequency and duration of required monitoring will depend on the form and magnitude of the anticipated take and the objectives of associated avoidance, minimization, or other mitigation measures, not to exceed what is reasonable to meet the primary purpose of the monitoring, which is to provide data needed by the Service regarding the impacts of the activity on eagles for purposes of adaptive management. You must coordinate with the Service to develop project-specific monitoring protocols. If the Service has officially issued or endorsed, through rulemaking procedures, monitoring protocols for the activity that will take eagles, you must follow them, unless the Service waives this requirement. Your permit may require that the monitoring be conducted by qualified, independent third parties that report directly to the Service.</P>
              <P>(3) You must submit an annual report summarizing the information you obtained through monitoring to the Service every year that your permit is valid and for up to 3 years after completion of the activity or termination of the permit, as specified in your permit. The Service will make eagle mortality information from annual reports available to the public.</P>
              <P>(4) While the permit is valid and for up to 3 years after it expires, you must allow Service personnel, or other qualified persons designated by the Service, access to the areas where eagles are likely to be affected, at any reasonable hour, and with reasonable notice from the Service, for purposes of monitoring eagles at the site(s).</P>
              <P>(5) The authorizations granted by permits issued under this section apply only to take that results from activities conducted in accordance with the description contained in the permit application and the terms of the permit. If the permitted activity changes after a permit is issued, you must immediately contact the Service to determine whether a permit amendment is required in order to retain take authorization.</P>
              <P>(6) You must contact the Service immediately upon discovery of any unanticipated take.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Additional conditions for permits with durations longer than 5 years</E>—(i) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> Monitoring to assess project impacts to eagles and the effectiveness of avoidance and minimization measures must be conducted by qualified, independent third parties, approved by the Service. Monitors must report directly to the Service and provide a copy of the reports and materials to the permittee.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adaptive management.</E> The permit will specify circumstances under which modifications to avoidance, minimization, or compensatory mitigation measures or monitoring protocols will be required, which may include, but are not limited to: Take levels, location of take, and changes in eagle use of the activity area. At a minimum, the permit must specify actions to be taken if take approaches or reaches the amount authorized and anticipated within a given time frame. Adaptive management terms in a permit will include review periods of no more than 5 years and may require prompt action(s) upon reaching specified conditions at any time during the review period.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Permit reviews.</E> At no more than 5 years from the date a permit that exceeds 5 years is issued, and at least every 5 years thereafter, the permittee will compile, and submit to the Service, eagle fatality data or other pertinent information that is site-specific for the project, as required by the permit. The Service will review this information, as well as information provided directly to the Service by independent monitors, to determine whether:<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) The permittee is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit and has implemented all applicable adaptive management measures specified in the permit; and</P>
              <P>(B) Eagle take does not exceed the amount authorized to occur within the period of review.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Actions to be taken based on the permit review.</E> (A) In consultation with the permittee, the Service will update fatality predictions, authorized take levels and compensatory mitigation for future years, taking into account the observed levels of take based on approved protocols for monitoring and estimating total take, and, if applicable, accounting for changes in operations or permit conditions pursuant to the adaptive management measures specified in the permit or made pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(iv)(B) through (D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) If authorized take levels for the period of review are exceeded in a manner or to a degree not addressed in the adaptive management conditions of the permit, based on the observed levels of take using approved protocols for monitoring and estimating total take, the Service may require additional actions including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Adding, removing, or adjusting avoidance, minimization, or compensatory mitigation measures;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Modifying adaptive management conditions;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Modifying monitoring requirements; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Suspending or revoking the permit in accordance with part 13 of this subchapter B.</P>
              <P>(C) If the observed levels of take, using approved protocols for monitoring and estimating total take, are below the authorized take levels for the period of review, the Service will proportionately revise the amount of compensatory mitigation required for the next period of review, including crediting excess compensatory mitigation already provided by applying it to the next period of review.</P>
              <P>(D) Provided the permittee implements all required actions and remains compliant with the terms and conditions of the permit, no other action is required. However, with consent of the permittee, the Service may make additional changes to a permit, including appropriate modifications to avoidance and/or minimization measures or monitoring requirements. If measures are adopted that have been shown to be effective in reducing risk to eagles, appropriate adjustments will be made in fatality predictions, take estimates, and compensatory mitigation.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Fees.</E> For permits with terms longer than 5 years, an administration fee of $8,000 will be assessed every 5 years for permit review.</P>
              <P>(8) The Service may amend, suspend, or revoke a permit issued under this section if new information indicates that revised permit conditions are necessary, or that suspension or revocation is necessary, to safeguard local or regional eagle populations. This provision is in addition to the general criteria for amendment, suspension, and revocation of Federal permits set forth in §§ 13.23, 13.27, and 13.28 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(9) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 13.26 of this chapter, you remain responsible for all outstanding monitoring requirements and mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that occurs prior to cancellation, expiration, suspension, or revocation of the permit.</P>
              <P>(10) You must promptly notify the Service of any eagle(s) found injured or dead at the activity site, regardless of whether the injury or death resulted from your activity. The Service will determine the disposition of such eagles.</P>
              <P>(11) You are responsible for ensuring that the permitted activity is in compliance with all Federal, Tribal, State, and local laws and regulations applicable to eagles.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applying for an eagle take permit.</E> (1) You are advised to coordinate with the Service as early as possible for advice on whether a permit is needed and for technical assistance in assembling your permit application package. The Service may provide guidance on developing complete and adequate application materials and will determine when the application form and materials are ready for submission.</P>

              <P>(2) Your application must consist of a completed application Form 3-200-71 <PRTPAGE P="148"/>and all required attachments. Send applications to the Regional Director of the Region in which the take would occur—Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office.

              <SUBJECT>Removal of eagle nests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> (1) A permit may be issued under this section to authorize removal or relocation of:</P>
              <P>(i) An in-use or alternate nest where necessary to alleviate an existing safety emergency, or to prevent a rapidly developing safety emergency that is otherwise likely to result in bodily harm to humans or eagles while the nest is still in use by eagles for breeding purposes;</P>
              <P>(ii) An alternate nest when the removal is necessary to ensure public health and safety;</P>
              <P>(iii) An alternate nest, or an in-use nest prior to egg-laying, that is built on a human-engineered structure and creates, or is likely to create, a functional hazard that renders the structure inoperable for its intended use; or</P>
              <P>(iv) An alternate nest, provided the take is necessary to protect an interest in a particular locality and the activity necessitating the take or the mitigation for the take will, with reasonable certainty, provide a net benefit to eagles.</P>
              <P>(2) Where practicable and biologically warranted, the permit may require a nest to be relocated, or a substitute nest provided, in a suitable site within the same territory to provide a viable nesting option for eagles within that territory, unless such relocation would create a threat to safety. However, we may issue permits to remove nests that we determine cannot or should not be relocated. The permit may authorize take of eggs or nestlings if present. The permit may also authorize the take of adult eagles (e.g., disturbance or capture) associated with the removal or relocation of the nest.</P>
              <P>(3) A permit may be issued under this section to cover multiple nest takes over a period of up to 5 years, provided the permittee complies with comprehensive measures developed in coordination with the Service to minimize the need to remove nests and specified as conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(4) This permit does not authorize intentional, lethal take of eagles.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conditions.</E>(1) The permit does not authorize take of in-use nests except:</P>
              <P>(i) For safety emergencies as provided under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Prior to egg-laying if the in-use nest is built on a human-engineered structure and meets the provisions set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) When an in-use nest must be removed under this permit, any take of nestlings or eggs must be conducted by a Service-approved, qualified agent. All nestlings and viable eggs must be immediately transported to foster/recipient nests or a rehabilitation facility permitted to care for eagles, as directed by the Service, unless the Service waives this requirement.</P>

              <P>(3) Possession of the nest for any purpose other than removal or relocation is prohibited without a separate permit <PRTPAGE P="151"/>issued under this part authorizing such possession.</P>
              <P>(4) You must submit a report consisting of a summary of the activities conducted under the permit to the Service within 30 days after the permitted take occurs, except that for programmatic permits, you must report each nest removal within 10 days after the take and submit an annual report by January 31 containing all the information required in Form 3-202-16 for activities conducted during the preceding calendar year.</P>
              <P>(5) You may be required to monitor the area and report whether eagles attempt to build or occupy another nest at another site in the vicinity for the duration specified in the permit.</P>
              <P>(6) You may be required under the terms of the permit to harass eagles from the area following the nest removal when the Service determines it is necessary to prevent eagles from re-nesting in the vicinity.</P>
              <P>(7) You must comply with all avoidance, minimization, or other mitigation measures specified in the terms of your permit to mitigate for the detrimental effects on eagles, including indirect and cumulative effects, of the permitted take.</P>
              <P>(8) Compensatory mitigation scaled to project impacts will be required for any permit authorizing take that would exceed the applicable eagle management unit take limits. Compensatory mitigation must conform to the standards set forth at § 22.26(c)(1)(iii). Compensatory mitigation may also be required in the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) When cumulative authorized take, including the proposed take, would exceed 5 percent of the local area population;</P>
              <P>(ii) When available data indicate that cumulative unauthorized mortality would exceed 10 percent of the local area population; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If the permitted activity does not provide a net benefit to eagles, you must apply appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation measures as specified in your permit to provide a net benefit to eagles scaled to the effects of the nest removal.</P>
              <P>(9) The Service may amend or revoke a programmatic permit issued under this section if new information indicates that revised permit conditions are necessary, or that suspension or revocation is necessary, to safeguard local or regional eagle populations.</P>
              <P>(10) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 13.26 of this subchapter, you remain responsible for all outstanding monitoring requirements and mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that occurs prior to cancellation, expiration, suspension, or revocation of the permit.</P>
              <P>(11) You are responsible for ensuring that the permitted activity is in compliance with all Federal, Tribal, State, and local laws and regulations applicable to eagles.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applying for a permit to take eagle nests.</E> (1) If the take is necessary to address an immediate threat to human or eagle safety, contact your local U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office (<E T="03">http://www.fws.gov/permits/mbpermits/addresses.html</E>) at the earliest possible opportunity to inform the Service of the emergency.</P>
              <P>(2) Your application must consist of a completed application Form 3-200-72 and all required attachments.

              <P>(a) Whenever the taking of golden eagles without a permit is authorized for the seasonal protection of livestock, such birds may be taken by firearms, traps, or other suitable means except by poison or from aircraft.<PRTPAGE P="154"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Any person exercising any of the privileges granted by this subpart D must permit all reasonable times, including during actual operations, any Service agent, or other game law enforcement officer free and unrestricted access over the premises on which such operations have been or are being conducted; and shall furnish promptly to such officer whatever information he may require concerning such operations.</P>
              <P>(c) The authority to take golden eagles under a depredations control order issued pursuant to this subpart D only authorizes the taking of golden eagles when necessary to seasonally protect domesticated flocks and herds, and all such birds taken must be reported and turned over to a local Bureau Agent.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Treaty.</E> The regulations in this part implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as CITES, the Convention, the Treaty, or the Washington Convention, TIAS (Treaties and Other International Acts Series) 8249.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The aim of CITES is to regulate international trade in wildlife and plants, including parts, products, and derivatives, to ensure it is legal and does not threaten the survival of species in the wild. Parties, recognize that:</P>
              <P>(1) Wildlife and plants are an irreplaceable part of the natural systems of the earth and must be protected for this and future generations.</P>

              <P>(2) The value of wildlife and plants is ever-growing from the viewpoints of aesthetics, science, culture, recreation, and economics.<PRTPAGE P="156"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Although countries should be the best protectors of their own wildlife and plants, international cooperation is essential to protect wildlife and plant species from over-exploitation through international trade.</P>
              <P>(4) It is urgent that countries take appropriate measures to prevent illegal trade and ensure that any use of wildlife and plants is sustainable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">National legislation.</E> We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), implement CITES through the Endangered Species Act (ESA).</P>

              <P>(a) You may need to comply with other regulations in this subchapter that require a permit or have additional restrictions. Many CITES species are also covered by one or more parts of this subchapter or title and have additional requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Part 15 (exotic birds).</P>
              <P>(2) Part 16 (injurious wildlife).</P>
              <P>(3) Parts 17 of this subchapter and 222, 223, and 224 of this title (endangered and threatened species).</P>
              <P>(4) Parts 18 of this subchapter and 216 of this title (marine mammals).</P>
              <P>(5) Part 20 (migratory bird hunting).</P>
              <P>(6) Part 21 (migratory birds).</P>
              <P>(7) Part 22 (bald and golden eagles).</P>
              <P>(b) If you are applying for a permit, you must comply with the general permit procedures in part 13 of this subchapter. Definitions and a list of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act can be found in part 10 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(c) If you are importing (including introduction from the sea), exporting, or re-exporting wildlife or plants, you must comply with the regulations in part 14 of this subchapter for wildlife or part 24 of this subchapter for plants. Activities with plants are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in 7 CFR parts 319, 355, and 356.</P>
              <P>(d) You may also need to comply with other Federal, State, tribal, or local requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are Appendices I, II, and III?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Species are listed by the Parties in one of three Appendices to the Treaty (see subpart H of this part), each of which provides a different level of protection and is subject to different requirements. Parties regulate trade in specimens of Appendix-I, -II, and -III species and their parts, products, and derivatives through a system of permits and certificates (CITES documents). Such documents enable Parties to monitor the effects of the volume and type of trade to ensure trade is legal and not detrimental to the survival of the species.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Appendix I</E> includes species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Trade in Appendix-I specimens may take place only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appendix II</E> includes species that are not presently threatened with extinction, but may become so if their trade is not regulated. It also includes species that need to be regulated so that trade in certain other Appendix-I or -II species may be effectively controlled; these species are most commonly listed due to their similarity of appearance to other related CITES species.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Appendix III</E> includes species listed unilaterally by a range country to obtain international cooperation in controlling trade.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 23.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How are the terms used in these regulations defined?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In addition to the definitions contained in part 10 of this subchapter, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this part:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Affected by trade</E> means that either a species is known to be in trade and the trade has or may have a detrimental impact on the status of the species, or a species is suspected to be in trade or there is demonstrable potential international demand for the species that may be detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.<PRTPAGE P="157"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Annotation</E> means an official footnote to the listing of a species in the CITES Appendices. A reference annotation provides information that further explains the listing (such as “p.e.” for possibly extinct). A substantive annotation is an integral part of a species listing. It designates whether the listing includes or excludes a geographically separate population, subspecies, species, group of species, or higher taxon, and the types of specimens included in or excluded from the listing, such as certain parts, products, or derivatives. A substantive annotation may designate export quotas adopted by the CoP.

              <P>Under Article IX of the Treaty, each Party must designate a Management and Scientific Authority to implement CITES for that country. If a non-Party wants to trade with a Party, it must also designate such Authorities. The names and addresses of these offices must be sent to the Secretariat to be included in the Directory. In the United States, different offices within the FWS have been designated the Scientific Authority and Management Authority, which for purposes of this section includes FWS Law Enforcement. When offices share activities, the Management Authority is responsible for dealing primarily with management and regulatory issues and the Scientific Authority is responsible for dealing primarily with scientific issues. The offices do the following:</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for in-transit shipments?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VII(1) of the Treaty allows for a shipment to transit an intermediary country that is a Party before reaching its final destination without the need for the intermediary Party to issue CITES documents. To control any illegal trade, Parties are to inspect, to the extent possible under their national legislation, specimens in transit through their territory to verify the presence of valid documentation. See § 23.50 for in-transit shipment of sample collections covered by an ATA carnet.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Document requirements.</E> An in-transit shipment does not require a CITES document from an intermediary country, but must be accompanied by all of the following documents:</P>
              <P>(1) Unless the specimen qualifies for an exemption under § 23.92, a valid original CITES document, or a copy of the valid original CITES document, that designates the name of the importer in the country of final destination and is issued by the Management Authority of the exporting or re-exporting country. A copy of a CITES document is subject to verification.</P>
              <P>(2) For shipment of an Appendix-I specimen, a copy of a valid import permit that designates the name of the importer in the country of final destination, unless the CITES document in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a CITES exemption document (see § 23.20(d)).</P>
              <P>(3) Transportation and routing documents that show the shipment has been consigned to the same importer and country of final destination as designated on the CITES document.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Shipment requirements.</E> An in-transit shipment, including items in an on-board store, must meet the following:</P>
              <P>(1) When in an intermediary country, an in-transit shipment must stay only for the time needed to immediately transfer the specimen to the mode of transport used to continue to the final destination and remain under customs control. Other than during immediate transfer, the specimen may not be stored in a duty-free, bonded, or other kind of warehouse or a free trade zone.</P>

              <P>(2) At any time during transit, an in-transit shipment must not be sold, manipulated, or split unless authorized by <PRTPAGE P="170"/>the Management Authority of the intermediary country for inspection or enforcement purposes.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reserving Party or non-Party.</E> All the requirements of this section apply to shipments to or from a reserving Party or non-Party that are being transshipped through a Party. The CITES document must treat the specimen as listed in the Appendix as provided in § 23.21(d).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Specimen protected by other regulations.</E> Shipment of a specimen that is also listed as a migratory bird (part 10 of this subchapter), injurious wildlife (part 16 of this subchapter), endangered or threatened species (parts 17 of this subchapter and 222-224 of this title), marine mammal (parts 18 of this subchapter and 216 of this title), or bald or golden eagle (part 22 of this subchapter), and is moving through the United States is considered an import, and cannot be treated as an in-transit shipment (see § 23.3).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 23.23</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What information is required on U.S. and foreign CITES documents?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VI of the Treaty provides standard information that must be on a permit and certificate issued under Articles III, IV, and V. To identify a false or invalid document, any CITES document, including a CITES exemption document issued under Article VII, must contain standardized information to allow a Party to verify that the specimen being shipped is the one listed on the document and that the trade is consistent with the provisions of the Treaty.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">CITES form.</E> A CITES document issued by a Party must be issued in one or more of the three working languages of CITES (English, Spanish, or French). A CITES document from a non-Party may be in the form of a permit or certificate, letter, or any other form that clearly indicates the nature of the document and includes the information in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section and the additional information in § 23.25.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Required information.</E> Except for a phytosanitary certificate used as a CITES certificate for artificially propagated plants in paragraph (f) of this section, or a customs declaration label used to identify specimens being moved between registered scientific institutions (§ 23.48(e)(5)), a CITES document issued by a Party or non-Party must contain the information set out in this paragraph (listed alphabetically). Specific types of CITES documents must also contain the additional information identified in paragraph (e) of this section. A CITES document is valid only when it contains the following information:</P>

              <SUBJECT>What CITES documents do I present at the port?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VIII of the Treaty provides that Parties establish an inspection process that takes place at a port of exit and entry. Inspecting officials must verify that valid CITES documents accompany shipments and take enforcement action when shipments do not comply with the Convention. Article VI, paragraph 6, of the Treaty requires that the Management Authority of the importing country cancel and retain the export permit or re-export certificate and any corresponding import permit presented. In the United States, for imports of CITES-listed plant specimens, CITES inspecting officials cancel and submit original CITES documents to the U.S. Management Authority.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">U.S. port requirements.</E> In the United States, you must follow the clearance requirements for wildlife in part 14 of this subchapter and for plants in part 24 of this subchapter and 7 CFR parts 319, 352, and 355, and the specific requirement in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">General validation or certification process.</E> Officials in each exporting or re-exporting country inspect the shipment and validate or certify the CITES document. The table in this paragraph (c) provides information on:</P>

              <P>(1) The types of original CITES documents you must present to be validated or certified by the inspecting official to export or re-export from a country.<PRTPAGE P="177"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) When you need to surrender a copy of the original CITES document to the inspecting official at the time of export or re-export.</P>
              <P>(3) When you need to surrender the original CITES document to the inspecting official at the time of import or introduction from the sea.</P>

              <P>(b) To determine the type of CITES document needed for your shipment, go to §§ 23.18 through 23.20 for further guidance.<PRTPAGE P="178"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) If a species is also regulated under another part of this subchapter (such as endangered or threatened species, see § 23.3), the requirements of all parts must be met. You may submit a single application that contains all the information needed to meet the requirements of CITES and other applicable parts.</P>
              <P>(d) You must also follow the general permit procedures in part 13 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) You should review the criteria in all applicable regulations in this subchapter that apply to the type of permit you are seeking before completing the application form.</P>
              <P>(f) We will review your application to assess whether it contains the information needed to make the required findings.</P>
              <P>(1) Based on available information, we will decide if any of the exemptions apply and what type of CITES document you need.</P>
              <P>(2) If we need additional information, we will contact you. If you do not provide the information within 45 calendar days, we will abandon your application. If your application is abandoned and you wish to apply for a permit at a later time, you must submit a new application.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon receiving a complete application, we will decide whether to issue a CITES document by considering:</P>
              <P>(1) The general criteria in § 13.21(b) of this subchapter and, if the species is protected under a separate law or treaty, criteria in any other applicable parts.</P>
              <P>(2) The CITES issuance criteria provided in this subpart (see subpart D of this part for factors we consider in making certain findings).</P>
              <P>(b) As needed, the U.S. Management Authority, including FWS Law Enforcement, will forward a copy of the application to the U.S. Scientific Authority; State, tribal, or other Federal government agencies; or other applicable experts. We may also query the Secretariat and foreign Management and Scientific Authorities for information to use in making the required findings.</P>
              <P>(c) You must provide sufficient information to satisfy us that all criteria specific to the proposed activity are met before we can issue a CITES document.</P>
              <P>(d) We will base our decision on whether to issue or deny the application on the best available information.</P>

              <P>(a) When you apply for a U.S. CITES document, you will be asked to provide information on the origin of the specimen that will be covered by the CITES document.</P>
              <P>(1) You need to provide sufficient information for us to determine if the issuance criteria in this part are met (see the sections in this subpart for each type of CITES document).</P>
              <P>(2) We require less detailed information when the import, introduction from the sea, export, or re-export poses a low risk to a species in the wild and more detailed information when the proposed activity poses greater risk to a species in the wild (see Subpart D of this part for factors we consider in making certain findings).</P>

              <P>(1) The United States is a party to an international treaty, convention, or agreement that affords protection to the species and was in force on July 1, 1975.</P>
              <P>(2) The ship that harvested the specimen is registered in the United States.</P>

              <P>(4) The shipment is accompanied by any official document required under the other international treaty, convention, or agreement or otherwise required by U.S. law.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Export of exempt specimens.</E> To export a specimen exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, you must obtain a CITES document from the U.S. Management Authority that indicates the specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of the other international treaty, convention, or agreement that was in force on July 1, 1975. See requirements in § 23.36 (e) through (g).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Appendix III.</E> Appendix-III species introduced from the sea do not require introduction-from-the-sea certificates. However, the subsequent international trade of an Appendix-III specimen introduced from the sea would be considered an export requiring a CITES document (see § 23.20(f)).</P>

              <P>(1) Trade in a specimen under the pre-Convention exemption is allowed only if the importing country will accept a pre-Convention certificate.</P>
              <P>(2) The pre-Convention date is the date the species was first listed under CITES regardless of whether the species has subsequently been transferred from one Appendix to another.</P>
              <P>(3) For a pre-Convention Appendix-I specimen, no CITES import permit is required.</P>
              <P>(4) The pre-Convention exemption does not apply to offspring or cell lines of any wildlife or plant born or propagated after the date the species was first listed under CITES.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for registering a commercial breeding operation for Appendix-I wildlife and commercially exporting specimens?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VII(4) of the Treaty provides that Appendix-I specimens that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes shall be deemed to be listed in Appendix II. This means that an Appendix-I specimen originating from a commercial breeding operation that is registered with the CITES Secretariat may be traded under an export permit or re-export <PRTPAGE P="190"/>certificate based on Appendix-II criteria. The specimen is still listed in Appendix I and is not eligible for any exemption granted to an Appendix-II species or taxon, including any exemption granted by an annotation (see § 23.92).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">U.S. and foreign general provisions.</E> The following provisions apply to the registration of U.S. and foreign commercial breeding operations for Appendix-I wildlife:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Management Authority is satisfied that the operation in its country meets the conditions for registration in paragraph (d) of this section, it will send the request to register a breeding operation to the Secretariat.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretariat will verify that the application is complete and notify the Parties of the request.</P>
              <P>(3) If any Party objects to or expresses concern about the registration within 90 days from the date of the Secretariat's notification, the Secretariat will refer the application to the Animals Committee. The Committee has 60 days to respond to objections. The Secretariat will provide the recommendations of the Committee to the Management Authority of the Party that submitted the application and the Party that objected to the registration, and will allow a further 30 days for resolution of the identified problems.</P>
              <P>(4) If the objection is not withdrawn or the identified problems are not resolved within the 30-day period, the Secretariat will submit the application to the Standing Committee at its next regular meeting. The Standing Committee will determine whether the objection is justified and decide whether to accept the application.</P>
              <P>(5) When the Secretariat is satisfied that the operation meets the registration requirements, it will include the operation in its register.</P>
              <P>(6) Operations are assigned an identification number and listed in the official register. Registration is not final until the Secretariat notifies all Parties.</P>
              <P>(7) If a Party believes that a registered operation does not meet the bred-in-captivity requirements, it may, after consultation with the Secretariat and the Party concerned, propose to the Standing Committee that the operation be deleted from the register. At its following meeting, the Standing Committee will consider the concerns raised by the objecting Party, and any comments from the registering Party and the Secretariat, and determine whether the operation should be deleted from the register. Once an operation has been deleted, it must re-apply and meet the registration requirements to be reinstated.</P>
              <P>(8) The Management Authority, in collaboration with the Scientific Authority, of a country where any registered operation is located must monitor the operation to ensure that it continues to meet the registration requirements. In the United States, we will monitor registered operations, in part, by requiring each operation to apply for renewal and demonstrate that it continues to qualify for registration at least once every 5 years. (See paragraphs (e)(4) and (f) of this section.) The Management Authority will advise the Secretariat of any major change in the nature of the operation or in the types of products being produced for export.</P>
              <P>(9) A Party may unilaterally request the removal of a registered operation within its jurisdiction by notifying the Secretariat.</P>
              <P>(10) An Appendix-I specimen may not be imported for purposes of establishing or augmenting a commercial breeding operation, unless the specimen is pre-Convention (see § 23.45) or was bred in captivity (see § 23.63).</P>

              <P>(3) A separate certificate must be issued for each live wildlife specimen; a CITES document may be issued for more than one specimen for a traveling exhibition of live plants and dead parts, products, or derivatives of wildlife and plants.</P>
              <P>(4) The certificate is not transferable.</P>
              <P>(5) Parties should treat the certificate like a passport for import and export or re-export from each country, and should not collect the original certificate at the border.</P>
              <P>(6) Parties should check specimens closely to determine that each specimen matches the certificate and ensure that each live specimen is being transported and cared for in a manner that minimizes the risk of injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the specimen.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for obtaining a retrospective CITES document?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Retrospective CITES documents may be issued and accepted in certain limited situations after an export or re-export has occurred, but before the shipment is cleared for import. When specific conditions are met, a retrospective CITES document may be issued to authorize trade that has taken place without a CITES document or to correct certain technical errors in a CITES document after the authorized activity has occurred.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">U.S. and foreign general provisions.</E> The following provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of a retrospective CITES document:</P>
              <P>(1) A retrospective document may not be issued for Appendix-I specimens except for certain specimens for personal use as specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The exporter or re-exporter must notify the Management Authority in the exporting or re-exporting country of the irregularities that have occurred.</P>
              <P>(3) A retrospective document may be one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An amended CITES document where it can be shown that the issuing Management Authority made a technical error that was not prompted by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(ii) A newly issued CITES document where it can be shown that the applicant was misinformed by CITES officials or the circumstances in (d)(7) of this section apply and a shipment has occurred without a document.</P>
              <P>(4) Retrospective documents can only be issued after consultation between the Management Authorities in both the exporting or re-exporting country and the importing country, including a thorough investigation of circumstances and agreement between them that criteria in paragraph (d) of this section have been met.</P>
              <P>(5) The issuing Management Authority must provide all of the following information on any retrospective CITES document:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement that it was issued retrospectively.</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement specifying the reason for the issuance.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of a document issued for personal use, a condition restricting sale of the specimen within 6 months following the import of the specimen.</P>
              <P>(6) The issuing Management Authority must send a copy of the retrospective CITES document to the Secretariat.</P>
              <P>(7) In general, except when the exporter or re-exporter and importer have demonstrated they were not responsible for the irregularities, any person who has been issued a CITES document in the past will not be eligible to receive a retrospective document.</P>
              <P>(8) In the United States, you may not use a U.S. CITES document issued under a CITES master file or CITES annual program as a retrospective CITES document.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">U.S. application.</E> Complete application Form 3-200-58 and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority. In addition, submit one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) For a shipment that occurred under a document containing a technical error, the faulty CITES document.</P>
              <P>(2) For a shipment that occurred without a CITES document, a completed application form for the type of activity you conducted (see §§ 23.18 through 23.20).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign documents. When applying for a U.S. document, you must provide sufficient information for us to find that your activity meets all of the following criteria:</P>

              <P>(1) The specimens were exported or re-exported without a CITES document <PRTPAGE P="200"/>or with a CITES document that contained technical errors as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The specimens were presented to the appropriate official for inspection at the time of import and a request for a retrospective CITES document was made at that time.</P>
              <P>(3) The export or re-export and import of the specimens was otherwise in compliance with CITES and the relevant national legislation of the countries involved.</P>
              <P>(4) The importing Management Authority has agreed to accept the retrospectively issued CITES document.</P>
              <P>(5) The specimens must be Appendix-II or -III wildlife or plants, except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the exporter or re-exporter and importer were not responsible for the irregularities that occurred and have demonstrated one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The Management Authority or officials designated to clear CITES shipments misinformed the exporter or re-exporter or the importer about the CITES requirements. In the United States, this would be an employee of the FWS (for any species) or APHIS or CBP (for plants).</P>
              <P>(ii) The Management Authority made a technical error when issuing the CITES document that was not prompted by information provided by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(7) In the case of specimens for personal use, you must either show that you qualify under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, or that a genuine error was made and that there was no attempt to deceive. The following specimens for personal use may qualify for issuance of a retrospective document:</P>
              <P>(i) Personal or household effects as defined in § 23.5.</P>
              <P>(ii) Live Appendix-II or -III specimens or live pre-Convention Appendix-I specimens that you own for your personal use, accompanied you, and number no more than two.</P>
              <P>(iii) Parts, products, or derivatives of an Appendix-I species that qualify as pre-Convention when the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(A) You own and possess the specimen for personal use.</P>
              <P>(B) You either wore the specimen as clothing or an accessory or took it as part of your personal baggage, which was carried by you or checked as baggage on the same plane, boat, car, or train as you.</P>
              <P>(C) The quantity is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the nature of your trip or stay.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">U.S. standard conditions.</E> In addition to the conditions in § 23.56, the following condition applies: A CITES document issued for a shipment that has already occurred does not require validation.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Validation.</E> Submit the original unvalidated retrospective CITES document to the appropriate foreign authority. We will not validate the retrospective CITES document for a shipment that has already been shipped to a foreign country, and we do not require validation on retrospective documents issued by foreign Management Authorities.</P>

              <P>(1) You must comply with the provisions of part 13 of this subchapter as conditions of the document, as well as other applicable regulations in this subchapter, including, but not limited to, any that require permits. You must comply with all applicable local, State, Federal, tribal, and foreign wildlife or plant conservation laws.</P>

              <P>(2) For export and re-export of live wildlife and plants, transport conditions must comply with the <E T="03">International Air Transport Association Live Animals Regulations</E> (for animals) or the <E T="03">International Air Transport Association Perishable Cargo Regulations</E> (for plants) (incorporated by reference, see § 23.9).</P>
              <P>(3) You must return the original CITES document to the issuing office if you do not use it, it expires, or you request renewal or amendment.</P>

              <P>(4) When appropriate, a Management Authority may require that you identify Appendix-II and -III wildlife or plants with a mark. All live Appendix-I wildlife must be securely marked or uniquely identified. Such mark or identification must be made in a way that the border official can verify that the specimen and CITES document correspond. If a microchip is used, we <PRTPAGE P="202"/>may, if necessary, ask the importer, exporter, or re-exporter to have equipment on hand to read the microchip at the time of import, export, or re-export.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What factors are considered in making a legal acquisition finding?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Articles III, IV, and V of the Treaty require a Management Authority to make a legal acquisition finding before issuing export permits and re-export certificates. The Parties have agreed that a legal acquisition finding must also be made before issuing certain CITES exemption documents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Types of legal acquisition.</E> Legal acquisition refers to whether the specimen and its parental stock were:</P>
              <P>(1) Obtained in accordance with the provisions of national laws for the protection of wildlife and plants. In the United States, these laws include all applicable local, State, Federal, tribal, and foreign laws; and</P>
              <P>(2) If previously traded, traded internationally in accordance with the provisions of CITES.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How we make our findings.</E> We make a finding that a specimen was legally acquired in the following way:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant must provide sufficient information (see § 23.34) for us to make a legal acquisition finding.</P>
              <P>(2) We make this finding after considering all available information.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of information we need to make the finding is based on our review of general factors described in paragraph (d) of this section and additional specific factors described in paragraphs (e) through (k) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) As necessary, we consult with foreign Management and Scientific Authorities, the CITES Secretariat, State conservation agencies, Tribes, FWS Law Enforcement, APHIS or CBP, and other appropriate experts.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Risk assessment.</E> We review the general factors listed in this paragraph and additional specific factors in paragraphs (e) through (k) of this section to assess the level of scrutiny and amount of information we need to make a finding of legal acquisition. We give less scrutiny and require less-detailed information when there is a low risk that specimens to be exported or re-exported were not legally acquired, and give more scrutiny and require more detailed information when the proposed activity poses greater risk. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of the international trade has a continuum of risk from high to low associated with it as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Status of the species</E>: From Appendix I to Appendix III.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Origin of the specimen</E>: From wild-collected to born or propagated in a controlled environment to bred in captivity or artificially propagated.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Source of the propagule used to grow the plant</E>: From documentation that the plant was grown from a non-exempt seed or seedling to documentation that the plant was grown from an exempt seed or seedling.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Origin of the species</E>: From species native to the United States or its bordering countries of Mexico or Canada to nonnative species from other countries.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Volume of illegal trade</E>: From high to low occurrence of illegal trade.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Type of trade</E>: From commercial to noncommercial.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Trade by range countries</E>: From range countries that do not allow commercial export, or allow only limited noncommercial export of the species, to range countries that allow commercial export in high volumes.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Occurrence of the species in a controlled environment in the United States</E>: From uncommon to common in a controlled environment in the United States.<PRTPAGE P="203"/>
              </P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Ability of the species to be bred or propagated readily in a controlled environment</E>: From no documentation that the species can be bred or propagated readily in a controlled environment to widely accepted information that the species is commonly bred or propagated.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Genetic status of the specimen</E>: From a purebred species to a hybrid.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Captive-bred wildlife or a cultivated plant.</E> For a specimen that is captive-bred or cultivated, we may consider whether the parental stock was legally acquired.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Confiscated specimen.</E> For a confiscated Appendix-II or -III specimen, we consider whether information shows that the transfer of the confiscated specimen or its offspring met the conditions of the remission decision, legal settlement, or disposal action after forfeiture or abandonment.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Donated specimen of unknown origin.</E> For an unsolicited specimen of unknown origin donated to a public institution (see § 10.12 of this subchapter), we consider whether:</P>
              <P>(1) The public institution follows standard recordkeeping practices and has made reasonable efforts to obtain supporting information on the origin of the specimen.</P>
              <P>(2) The public institution provides sufficient information to show it made a reasonable effort to find a suitable recipient in the United States.</P>
              <P>(3) The export will provide a conservation benefit to the species.</P>
              <P>(4) No persuasive information exists on illegal transactions involving the specimen.</P>
              <P>(5) The export is noncommercial, with no money or barter exchanged except for shipping costs.</P>
              <P>(6) The institution has no history of receiving a series of rare and valuable specimens or a large quantity of wildlife or plants of unknown origin.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Imported previously.</E> For a specimen that was previously imported into the United States, we consider any reliable, relevant information we receive concerning the validity of a CITES document, regardless of whether the shipment was cleared by FWS, APHIS, or CBP.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Personal use.</E> For a wildlife or plant specimen that is being exported or re-exported for personal use by the applicant, we consider whether:</P>
              <P>(1) The specimen was acquired in the United States and possessed for strictly personal use.</P>
              <P>(2) The number of specimens is reasonably appropriate for the nature of your export or re-export as personal use.</P>
              <P>(3) No persuasive evidence exists on illegal transactions involving the specimen.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Sequential ownership.</E> For a specimen that was previously possessed by someone other than the applicant, we may consider the history of ownership for a specimen and its parental stock, breeding stock, or cultivated parental stock.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Wild-collected in the United States.</E> For a specimen collected from the wild in the United States, we consider the site where the specimen was collected, whether the species is known to occur at that site, the abundance of the species at that site, and, if necessary, whether permission of the appropriate management agency or landowner was obtained to collect the specimen.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What factors are considered in making a non-detriment finding?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Articles III and IV of the Treaty require that, before we issue a CITES document, we find that a proposed export or introduction from the sea of Appendix-I or -II specimens is not detrimental to the survival of the species and that a proposed import of an Appendix-I specimen is for purposes that would not be detrimental to the survival of the species.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Types of detriment.</E> Detrimental activities, depending on the species, could include, among other things, unsustainable use and any activities that would pose a net harm to the status of the species in the wild. For Appendix-I species, it also includes use or removal from the wild that results in habitat loss or destruction, interference with recovery efforts for a species, or stimulation of further trade.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">General factors.</E> The applicant must provide sufficient information for us to make a finding of non-detriment. In addition to factors in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, we will consider whether:<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Biological and management information demonstrates that the proposed activity represents sustainable use.</P>
              <P>(2) The removal of the animal or plant from the wild is part of a biologically based sustainable-use management plan that is designed to eliminate over-utilization of the species.</P>
              <P>(3) If no sustainable-use management plan has been established, the removal of the animal or plant from the wild would not contribute to the over-utilization of the species, considering both domestic and international uses.</P>
              <P>(4) The proposed activity, including the methods used to acquire the specimen, would pose no net harm to the status of the species in the wild.</P>
              <P>(5) The proposed activity would not lead to long-term declines that would place the viability of the affected population in question.</P>
              <P>(6) The proposed activity would not lead to significant habitat or range loss or restriction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional factor for Appendix-II species.</E> In addition to the general factors in paragraph (c) of this section, we will consider whether the intended export of an Appendix-II species would cause a significant risk that the species would qualify for inclusion in Appendix I.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional factors for Appendix-I species.</E> In addition to the general factors in paragraph (c) of this section, we will consider whether the proposed activity:</P>
              <P>(1) Would not cause an increased risk of extinction for either the species as a whole or the population from which the specimen was obtained.</P>
              <P>(2) Would not interfere with the recovery of the species.</P>
              <P>(3) Would not stimulate additional trade in the species. If the proposed activity does stimulate trade, we will consider whether the anticipated increase in trade would lead to the decline of the species.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">How we make our findings.</E> We base the non-detriment finding on the best available biological information. We also consider trade information, including trade demand, and other scientific management information. We make a non-detriment finding in the following way:</P>
              <P>(1) We consult with the States, Tribes, other Federal agencies, scientists, other experts, and the range countries of the species.</P>
              <P>(2) We consult with the Secretariat and other Parties to monitor the level of trade that is occurring in the species.</P>
              <P>(3) Based on the factors in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, we evaluate the biological impact of the proposed activity.</P>
              <P>(4) In cases where insufficient information is available or the factors above are not satisfactorily addressed, we take precautionary measures and would be unable to make the required finding of non-detriment.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Risk assessment.</E> We review the status of the species in the wild and the degree of risk the proposed activity poses to the species to determine the level of scrutiny needed to make a finding. We give greater scrutiny and require more detailed information for activities that pose a greater risk to a species in the wild. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of international trade has a continuum of risk (from high to low) associated with it as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Status of the species</E>: From Appendix I to Appendix II.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Origin of the specimen</E>: From wild-collected to born or propagated in a controlled environment to bred in captivity or artificially propagated.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Source of the propagule used to grow the plant</E>: From documentation that the plant was grown from a non-exempt seed or seedling to documentation that the plant was grown from an exempt seed or seedling.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Origin of the species</E>: From native species to nonnative species.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Volume of legal trade</E>: From high to low occurrence of legal trade.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Volume of illegal trade</E>: From high to low occurrence of illegal trade.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Type of trade</E>: From commercial to noncommercial.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Genetic status of the specimen</E>: From a purebred species to a hybrid.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Risk of disease transmission</E>: From high to limited risk of disease transmission.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Basis for listing</E>: From listed under Article II(1) or II(2)(a) of the Treaty to listed under Article II(2)(b).<PRTPAGE P="205"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Quotas for Appendix-I species.</E> When an export quota has been set by the CoP for an Appendix-I species, we will consider the scientific and management basis of the quota together with the best available biological information when we make our non-detriment finding. We will contact the Scientific and Management Authorities of the exporting country for further information if needed.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 23.62</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What factors are considered in making a finding of not for primarily commercial purposes?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Under Article III(3(c)) and (5(c)) of the Treaty, an import permit or an introduction-from-the-sea certificate for Appendix-I species can be issued only if the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimen is not to be used for primarily commercial purposes. Trade in Appendix-I species must be subject to particularly strict regulation and authorized only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How we make our findings.</E> We must find that the intended use of the Appendix-I specimen is not for primarily commercial purposes before we can issue a CITES document.</P>
              <P>(1) We will make this decision on a case-by-case basis considering all available information.</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant must provide sufficient information to satisfy us that the intended use is not for primarily commercial purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) The definitions of “commercial” and “primarily commercial purposes” in § 23.5 apply.</P>
              <P>(4) We will look at all aspects of the intended use of the specimen. If the noncommercial aspects do not clearly predominate, we will consider the import or introduction from the sea to be for primarily commercial purposes.</P>
              <P>(5) While the nature of the transaction between the owner in the country of export and the recipient in the country of import or introduction from the sea may have some commercial aspects, such as the exchange of money to cover the costs of shipment and care of specimens during transport, it is the intended use of the specimen, including the purpose of the export, that must not be for primarily commercial purposes.</P>
              <P>(6) We will conduct an assessment of factors listed in paragraph (d) of this section. For activities involving an anticipated measurable increase in revenue and other economic value associated with the intended use, we will conduct an analysis as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) All net profits generated in the United States from activities associated with the import of an Appendix-I species must be used for conservation of that species.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following are examples of types of transactions in which the noncommercial aspects of the intended use of the specimen may predominate depending on the facts of each situation. The discussions of each example provide further guidance in assessing the actual degree of commerciality on a case-by-case basis. These examples outline circumstances commonly encountered and do not cover all situations where import or introduction from the sea could be found to be not for primarily commercial purposes.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Personal use.</E> Import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen for personal use generally is considered to be not for primarily commercial purposes. An example is the import of a personal sport-hunted trophy by the person who hunted the wildlife for display in his or her own home.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Scientific purposes.</E> The import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen by a scientist or scientific institution may be permitted in situations where resale, commercial exchange, or exhibit of the specimen for economic benefit is not the primary intended use.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Conservation, education, or training.</E> Generally an Appendix-I specimen may be imported or introduced from the sea by government agencies or nonprofit institutions for purposes of conservation, education, or training. For example, a specimen could be imported or introduced from the sea primarily to train customs staff in effective CITES control, such as for identification of certain types of specimens.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Biomedical industry.</E> Import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen by an institution or company in the biomedical industry is <PRTPAGE P="206"/>initially presumed to be commercial since specimens are typically imported or introduced from the sea to develop and sell products that promote public health for profit. However, if the importer clearly shows that the sale of products is only incidental to public health research and not for the primary purpose of economic benefit or profit, then such an import or introduction from the sea could be considered as scientific research under paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the principles of paragraph (b) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Captive-breeding or artificial propagation programs.</E> The import of an Appendix-I specimen for purposes of establishing a commercial operation for breeding or artificial propagation is considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. As a general rule, import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen for a captive-breeding or artificial propagation program must have as a priority the long-term protection and recovery of the species in the wild. The captive-breeding or artificial propagation program must be part of a program aimed at the recovery of the species in the wild and be undertaken with the support of a country within the species' native range. Any profit gained must be used to support this recovery program. If a captive-breeding or artificial propagation operation plans to sell surplus specimens to help offset the costs of its program, import or introduction from the sea would be allowed only if any profit would be used to support the captive-breeding or artificial propagation program to the benefit of the Appendix-I species, not for the personal economic benefit of a private individual or share-holder.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Professional dealers.</E> Import or introduction from the sea by a professional dealer who states a general intention to eventually sell the specimen or its offspring to an undetermined recipient would be considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. However, import or introduction from the sea through a professional dealer by a qualified applicant may be acceptable if the ultimate intended use would be for one of the purposes set out in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (5) of this section and where a binding contract, conditioned on the issuing of permits, is in place.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Risk assessment.</E> We review the factors listed in this paragraph (d) to assess the level of scrutiny and amount of information we need to make a finding of whether the intended use of the specimen is not for primarily commercial purposes. We give less scrutiny and require less detailed information when the import or introduction from the sea poses a low risk of being primarily commercial, and give more scrutiny and require more detailed information when the proposed activity poses greater risk. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of the international trade has a continuum of risk from high to low associated with it as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Type of importer</E>: From for-profit entity to private individual to nonprofit entity.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ability of the proposed uses to generate revenue</E>: From the ability to generate measurable increases in revenue or other economic value to no anticipated increases in revenue or other economic value.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Appeal of the species</E>: From high public appeal to low public appeal.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Occurrence of the species in the United States</E>: From uncommon to common in a controlled environment in the United States.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Intended use of offspring</E>: From commercial to noncommercial.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Analysis of anticipated revenues and other economic value.</E> We will analyze revenues and other economic value anticipated to result from the use of the specimen for activities with a high risk of being primarily commercial.</P>
              <P>(1) We will examine the proposed use of any net profits generated in the United States. We consider net profit to include all funds or other valuable considerations (including enhanced value of common stock shares) received or attained by you or those affiliated with you as a result of the import or introduction from the sea, to the extent that such funds or other valuable considerations exceed the reasonable expenses that are properly attributable to the proposed activity.</P>

              <P>(2) We will consider any conservation project to be funded and, if the species <PRTPAGE P="207"/>was or is to be taken from the wild, how the project benefits the species in its native range, including agreements, timeframes for accomplishing tasks, and anticipated benefits to the species.</P>
              <P>(3) We will consider any plans to monitor a proposed conservation project, including expenditure of funds or completion of tasks.</P>
              <P>(4) In rare cases involving unusually high net profits, we will require the applicant to provide a detailed analysis of expected revenue (both direct and indirect) and expenses to show anticipated net profit, and a statement from a licensed, independent certified public accountant that the internal accounting system is sufficient to account for and track funds generated by the proposed activities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What factors are considered in making a finding that an animal is bred in captivity?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VII(4) and (5) of the Treaty provide exemptions that allow for the special treatment of wildlife that was bred in captivity (see §§ 23.41 and 23.46).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following terms apply when determining whether specimens qualify as “bred in captivity”:</P>
              <P>(1) A <E T="03">controlled environment</E> means one that is actively manipulated for the purpose of producing specimens of a particular species; that has boundaries designed to prevent specimens, including eggs or gametes, from entering or leaving the controlled environment; and has general characteristics that may include artificial housing, waste removal, provision of veterinary care, protection from predators, and artificially supplied food.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Breeding stock</E> means an ensemble of captive wildlife used for reproduction.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Bred-in-captivity criteria.</E> For a specimen to qualify as bred in captivity, we must be satisfied that all the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) If reproduction is sexual, the specimen was born to parents that either mated or transferred gametes in a controlled environment.</P>
              <P>(2) If reproduction is asexual, the parent was in a controlled environment when development of the offspring began.</P>
              <P>(3) The breeding stock meets all of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Was established in accordance with the provisions of CITES and relevant national laws.</P>
              <P>(ii) Was established in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.</P>
              <P>(iii) Is maintained with only occasional introduction of wild specimens as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Has consistently produced offspring of second or subsequent generations in a controlled environment, or is managed in a way that has been demonstrated to be capable of reliably producing second-generation offspring and has produced first-generation offspring.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Addition of wild specimens.</E> A very limited number of wild specimens (including eggs or gametes) may be introduced into a breeding stock if all of the following conditions are met (for Appendix-I specimens see also § 23.46(b)(12)):</P>
              <P>(1) The specimens were acquired in accordance with the provisions of CITES and relevant national laws.</P>
              <P>(2) The specimens were acquired in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.</P>
              <P>(3) The specimens were added either to prevent or alleviate deleterious inbreeding, with the number of specimens added as determined by the need for new genetic material, or to dispose of confiscated animals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What factors are considered in making a finding that a plant is artificially propagated?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VII(4) and (5) of the Treaty provide exemptions that allow for special treatment of plants that were artificially propagated (see §§ 23.40 and 23.47).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition</E>s. The following terms apply when determining whether specimens qualify as “artificially propagated”:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Controlled conditions</E> means a nonnatural environment that is intensively manipulated by human intervention for the purpose of plant production. General characteristics of controlled conditions may include, but are not limited to, tillage, fertilization, weed and pest control, irrigation, or <PRTPAGE P="208"/>nursery operations such as potting, bedding, or protection from weather.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cultivated parental stock</E> means the ensemble of plants grown under controlled conditions that are used for reproduction.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Artificially propagated criteria.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, for a plant specimen to qualify as artificially propagated, we must be satisfied that the plant specimen was grown under controlled conditions from a seed, cutting, division, callus tissue, other plant tissue, spore, or other propagule that either is exempt from the provisions of CITES or has been derived from cultivated parental stock. The cultivated parental stock must meet all of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) Was established in accordance with the provisions of CITES and relevant national laws.</P>
              <P>(2) Was established in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.</P>
              <P>(3) Is maintained in sufficient quantities for propagation so as to minimize or eliminate the need for augmentation from the wild, with such augmentation occurring only as an exception and limited to the amount necessary to maintain the vigor and productivity of the cultivated parental stock.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Cutting or division.</E> A plant grown from a cutting or division is considered to be artificially propagated only if the traded specimen does not contain any material collected from the wild.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Grafted plant.</E> A grafted plant is artificially propagated only when both the rootstock and the material grafted to it have been taken from specimens that were artificially propagated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. A grafted specimen that consists of taxa from different Appendices is treated as a specimen of the taxon listed in the more restrictive Appendix.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Timber.</E> Timber taken from trees planted and grown in a monospecific plantation is considered artificially propagated if the seeds or other propagules from which the trees are grown were legally acquired and obtained in a non-detrimental manner.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exception for certain plant specimens grown from wild-collected seeds or spores.</E> Plant specimens grown from wild-collected seeds or spores may be considered artificially propagated only when all of the following conditions have been met:</P>
              <P>(1) Establishment of a cultivated parental stock for the taxon presents significant difficulties because specimens take a long time to reach reproductive age.</P>
              <P>(2) The seeds or spores are collected from the wild and grown under controlled conditions within a range country, which must also be the country of origin of the seeds or spores.</P>
              <P>(3) The Management Authority of the range country has determined that the collection of seeds or spores was legal and consistent with relevant national laws for the protection and conservation of the species.</P>
              <P>(4) The Scientific Authority of the range country has determined that collection of the seeds or spores was not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild, and allowing trade in such specimens has a positive effect on the conservation of wild populations. In making these determinations, all of the following conditions must be met:</P>
              <P>(i) The collection of seeds or spores for this purpose must be limited in such a manner as to allow regeneration of the wild population.</P>
              <P>(ii) A portion of the plants produced must be used to establish plantations to serve as cultivated parental stock in the future and become an additional source of seeds or spores and thus reduce or eliminate the need to collect seeds or spores from the wild.</P>
              <P>(iii) A portion of the plants produced must be used for replanting in the wild, to enhance recovery of existing populations or to re-establish populations that have been extirpated.</P>
              <P>(5) Operations propagating Appendix-I species for commercial purposes must be registered with the CITES Secretariat in accordance with the Guidelines for the registration of nurseries exporting artificially propagated specimens of Appendix-I species.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Under Article III(3)(b) and (5)(b) of the Treaty, an import permit or introduction-from-the-sea certificate for live Appendix-I specimens can be issued only if we are satisfied that the recipients are suitably equipped to house and care for them.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General principles.</E> We will follow these general principles in making a decision on whether an applicant has facilities that would provide proper housing to maintain the specimens for the intended purpose and the expertise to provide proper care and husbandry or horticultural practices.</P>
              <P>(1) All persons who would be receiving a specimen must be identified in an application and their facilities approved by us, including persons who are likely to receive a specimen within 1 year after it arrives in the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant must provide sufficient information for us to make a finding, including, but not limited to, a description of the facility, photographs, or construction plans, and resumes of the recipient or staff who will care for the specimen.</P>
              <P>(3) We use the best available information on the requirements of the species in making a decision and will consult with experts and other Federal and State agencies, as necessary and appropriate.</P>
              <P>(4) The degree of scrutiny that we give an application is based on the biological and husbandry or horticultural needs of the species.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific factors considered for wildlife.</E> In addition to the general provisions in paragraph (e) of this section, we consider the following factors in evaluating suitable housing and care for wildlife:</P>
              <P>(1) Enclosures constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, or abnormal behavior patterns.</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate forms of environmental enrichment, such as nesting material, perches, climbing apparatus, ground substrate, or other species-specific materials or objects.</P>
              <P>(3) If the wildlife is on public display, an off-exhibit area, consisting of indoor and outdoor accommodations, as appropriate, that can house the wildlife on a long-term basis if necessary.</P>
              <P>(4) Provision of water and nutritious food of a nature and in a way that are appropriate for the species.</P>
              <P>(5) Staff who are trained and experienced in providing proper daily care and maintenance for the species being imported or introduced from the sea, or for a closely related species.</P>
              <P>(6) Readily available veterinary care or veterinary staff experienced with the species or a closely related species, including emergency care.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific factors considered for plants.</E> In addition to the general provisions in paragraph (e) of the section, we consider the following factors in evaluating suitable housing and care for plants:</P>
              <P>(1) Sufficient space, appropriate lighting, and other environmental conditions that will ensure proper growth.</P>
              <P>(2) Ability to provide appropriate culture, such as water, fertilizer, and pest and disease control.</P>
              <P>(3) Staff with experience with the imported species or related species with similar horticultural requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">General factors considered for wildlife and plants.</E> In addition to the specific provisions in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, we will consider the following factors in evaluating suitable housing and care for wildlife and plants:</P>
              <P>(1) Adequate enclosures or holding areas to prevent escape or unplanned exchange of genetic material with specimens of the same or different species outside the facility.</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate security to prevent theft of specimens and measures taken to rectify any previous theft or security problem.</P>

              <P>(3) A reasonable survival rate of specimens of the same species or, alternatively, closely related species at the facility, mortalities for the previous 3 years, significant injuries to wildlife or <PRTPAGE P="210"/>damage to plants, occurrence of significant disease outbreaks during the previous 3 years, and measures taken to prevent similar mortalities, injuries, damage, or diseases. Significant injuries, damage, or disease outbreaks are those that are permanently debilitating or re-occurring.</P>
              <P>(4) Sufficient funding on a long-term basis to cover the cost of maintaining the facility and the specimens imported.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Incomplete facilities or insufficient staff.</E> For applications submitted to us before the facilities to hold the specimen are completed or the staff is identified or properly trained, we will:</P>
              <P>(1) Review all available information, including construction plans or intended staffing, and make a finding based on this information.</P>
              <P>(2) Place a condition on any permit that the import cannot occur until the facility has been completed or the staff hired and trained, and approved by us.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">U.S. and foreign provisions.</E> For the purposes of this section, <E T="03">sturgeon caviar</E> or <E T="03">caviar</E> means the processed roe of any species of sturgeon or paddlefish (order Acipenseriformes). It does not include sturgeon or paddlefish eggs contained in shampoos, cosmetics, lotions, or other products for topical application. The import, export, or re-export of sturgeon caviar must meet the requirements of this section and the other requirements of this part. The import, export, or re-export of Acipenseriformes specimens other than caviar must meet the other requirements of this part. See subparts B and C for prohibitions and application procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> You may import, export, or re-export sturgeon caviar only if labels are affixed to containers prior to export or re-export in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) The following definitions apply to caviar labeling:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Non-reusable label</E> means any label or mark that cannot be removed without being damaged or transferred to another container. In the United States, the design of the label will be determined by the labeler in accordance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Primary container</E> means any container (tin, jar, pail or other receptacle) in direct contact with the caviar.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(iv) Year of harvest. This is either the calendar year in which caviar was harvested or, for caviar imported from shared stocks subject to quotas, the quota year in which it was harvested.</P>
              <P>(v) Processing plant code and lot identification number.</P>
              <P>(3) If caviar is repackaged before export or re-export, the repackaging plant must affix a non-reusable label to the primary container that includes all of the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The standardized species code, source code, and two-letter ISO code of the country of origin.</P>
              <P>(ii) Year of repackaging and the repackaging plant code, which incorporates the two-letter ISO code for the repackaging country if different from the country of origin.</P>
              <P>(iii) Lot identification number or, for caviar that is being re-exported, the CITES document number under which it was imported may be used in place of the lot identification number.</P>
              <P>(4) The exact quantity of caviar must be indicated on any secondary container along with a description of the contents in accordance with international customs regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Documentation requirements.</E> Unless the sturgeon caviar qualifies as a personal or household effect under § 23.15, the CITES document or an annex attached to the document must contain all information that is given on the label. The exact quantity of each species of caviar must be indicated on the CITES document.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Export quotas.</E> Commercial shipments of sturgeon caviar from stocks shared between different countries may be imported only if all of the following conditions have been met:</P>
              <P>(1) The relevant countries have established annual export quotas for the shared stocks that were derived from catch quotas agreed among the countries. The quotas are based on an appropriate regional conservation strategy and monitoring regime and are not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.</P>
              <P>(2) The quotas have been communicated to the CITES Secretariat and the Secretariat has communicated the annual export quotas to CITES Parties.</P>
              <P>(3) The caviar is exported during the quota year (March 1 - last day of February) in which it was harvested and processed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Re-exports.</E> Any re-export of sturgeon caviar must occur within 18 months from the date of issuance of the original export permit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Pre-Convention.</E> Sturgeon caviar may not be imported, exported, or re-exported under a pre-Convention certificate.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Mixed caviar.</E> Caviar that consists of roe from more than one species may only be imported into or exported from the United States if the exact quantity of roe from each species is known and is indicated on the CITES document.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">U.S. application forms.</E> Application forms can be obtained from our website or by contacting us (see § 23.7). For CITES document requirements, see § 23.36 for export permits and § 23.37 for re-export certificates. For export, complete Form 3-200-76 or Form 3-200-80 and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority. For re-export, complete Form 3-200-73 and submit it either to FWS Law Enforcement or the U.S. Management Authority.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">CITES register of exporters and of processing and repackaging plants.</E> The CITES Secretariat maintains a “Register of licensed exporters and of processing and repackaging plants for specimens of sturgeon and paddlefish species” on its Web site. If you hold a current import-export license issued by FWS Law Enforcement and wish to be added to the CITES register, you may submit your contact information and processing or repackaging plant codes to the U.S. Management Authority for submission to the CITES Secretariat.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What happens to confiscated wildlife and plants?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article VIII of the Treaty provides for confiscation or return to the country of export of specimens that are traded in violation of CITES.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disposal options.</E> Part 12 of this subchapter provides the options we have for disposing of forfeited and abandoned live and dead wildlife and plants. These include maintenance in captivity either in the United States or in the country of export, return to the wild under limited circumstances, and sale of certain Appendix-II or -III specimens. Under some conditions, euthanasia or destruction may be necessary.</P>
              <P>(1) We use a plant rescue center program to dispose of confiscated live plants. Participants in this program may also assist APHIS, CBP, and FWS Law Enforcement in holding seized specimens as evidence pending any legal decisions.</P>
              <P>(2) We dispose of confiscated live wildlife on a case-by-case basis at the time of seizure and forfeiture, and consider the quantity, protection level, and husbandry needs of the wildlife.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Re-export.</E> We may issue a re-export certificate for a CITES specimen that was forfeited or abandoned when the certificate indicates the specimen was confiscated and when the re-export meets one of the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(1) For any CITES species, the return of a live specimen to the Management Authority of the country of export, placement of a live specimen in a rescue center, or use of the specimen for law enforcement, judicial, or forensic purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) For an Appendix-II or -III species, the disposal of the specimen in an appropriate manner that benefits enforcement and administration of the Convention.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Consultation process.</E> FWS and APHIS may consult with the Management Authority in the country of export or re-export and other relevant governmental and nongovernmental experts before making a decision on the disposal of confiscated live specimens that have been forfeited or abandoned to the FWS, APHIS, or CBP.</P>

              <P>(1) Nonprofit, open to the public, and have the expertise and facilities to care for confiscated exotic plant specimens. A participating institution may be a botanical garden, arboretum, zoological park, research institution, or other qualifying institution.</P>
              <P>(2) Willing to transfer confiscated plants from the port where they were confiscated to their facilities at their own expense.</P>
              <P>(3) Willing to return the plants to the U.S. Government if the country of export has requested their return. The U.S. Government will then coordinate the plants' return to the country of export.</P>
              <P>(4) Willing to accept and maintain a plant shipment as a unit until it has received authorization from us to incorporate the shipment into its permanent collection or transfer a portion of it to another participating institution.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Participation.</E> Institutions wishing to participate in the Plant Rescue Center Program should contact the U.S. Management Authority (see § 23.7). They must provide a brief description of the greenhouse or display facilities, the names and telephone numbers of any individuals authorized to accept plants on behalf of the institution, and the mailing address where the plants should be sent. In addition, interested institutions must indicate if they are limited with regard to the type of plants they are able to maintain or the quantities of plants they can handle at one time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is a meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP)?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article XI of the Treaty provides general guidelines for meetings of the countries that have ratified, accepted, approved, or acceded to CITES. The Parties currently meet for 2 weeks every 3 years. At these meetings, the Parties consider amendments to the Appendices and resolutions and decisions to improve the implementation of CITES. The Parties adopt amendments to the lists of species in Appendix I and II and resolutions by a two-thirds majority of Parties present and voting. The Secretariat or any <PRTPAGE P="223"/>Party may also submit reports on wildlife and plant trade for consideration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">CoP locations and dates.</E> At a CoP, Parties interested in hosting the next meeting notify the Secretariat. The Parties vote to select the location of the next CoP. Once a country has been chosen, it works with the Secretariat to set the date and specific venue. The Secretariat then notifies the Parties of the date for the next CoP.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Attendance at a CoP.</E> All Parties may participate and vote at a CoP. Non-Party countries may participate, but may not vote. Organizations technically qualified in protection, conservation, or management of wildlife or plants may participate in a CoP as observers if they are approved, but they are not eligible to vote.</P>
              <P>(1) International organizations must apply to the CITES Secretariat for approval to attend a CoP as an observer.</P>
              <P>(2) National organizations must apply to the Management Authority of the country where they are located for approval to attend a CoP as an observer.</P>

              <P>(a) A summary of the information we have received with an invitation for the public to comment and provide information on the agenda, proposed amendments to the Appendices, and proposed resolutions that they believe the United States should submit for consideration at the CoP.</P>
              <P>(b) Information on times, dates, and locations of public meetings.</P>
              <P>(c) Information on how international and national organizations may apply to participate as observers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does the United States develop documents and negotiating positions for a CoP?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In developing documents and negotiating positions for a CoP, we:</P>
              <P>(1) Will provide for at least one public meeting.</P>
              <P>(2) Consult with appropriate Federal, State, and tribal agencies; foreign governmental agencies; scientists; experts; and others.</P>
              <P>(3) Seek public comment through published <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notices or postings on our website that:</P>
              <P>(i) Solicit recommendations on potential proposals to amend the Appendices, draft resolutions, and other documents for U.S. submission to the CoP.</P>
              <P>(ii) Announce proposals to amend the Appendices, draft resolutions, and other documents that the United States is considering submitting to the CoP.</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide the CoP agenda and a list of the amendments to the Appendices proposed for the CoP, a summary of our proposed negotiating positions on these items, and the reasons for our proposed positions.</P>
              <P>(4) Consider comments received in response to notices or postings provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) We submit the following documents to the Secretariat for consideration at the CoP:</P>
              <P>(1) Draft resolutions and other documents at least 150 days before the CoP.</P>
              <P>(2) Proposals to amend the Appendices at least 150 days before the CoP if we have consulted all range countries, or 330 days before the CoP if we have not consulted the range countries. For the latter, the additional time allows for the range countries to be consulted through the Secretariat.</P>
              <P>(c) The Director may modify or suspend any of these procedures if they would interfere with the timely or appropriate development of documents for submission to the CoP and U.S. negotiating positions.</P>
              <P>(d) We may receive additional information at a CoP or circumstances may develop that have an impact on our tentative negotiating positions. As a result, the U.S. representatives to a CoP may find it necessary to modify, reverse, or otherwise change any of those positions when to do so would be in the best interests of the United States or the conservation of the species.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the criteria for listing species in Appendix I or II?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article XV of the Treaty sets out the procedures for amending CITES Appendices I and II. A species must meet trade and biological criteria listed in the CITES resolution for amendment of Appendices I and II. When determining whether a species qualifies for inclusion in or removal from Appendix I or II, or transfer from one Appendix to another, we will:</P>
              <P>(1) Consult with States, Tribes, range countries, relevant experts, other Federal agencies, and the general public.</P>
              <P>(2) Utilize the best available biological information.</P>
              <P>(3) Evaluate that information against the criteria in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b<E T="03">) Listing a species in Appendix I.</E> Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix I if it is or may be affected by trade and meets, or is likely to meet, at least one biological criterion for Appendix I.</P>
              <P>(1) These criteria are:</P>
              <P>(i) The size of the wild population is small.</P>
              <P>(ii) Area of distribution is restricted.</P>
              <P>(iii) There is an observed, inferred, or projected marked decline in the population size in the wild.</P>
              <P>(2) Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, population and range fragmentation; habitat availability or quality; area of distribution; taxon-specific vulnerabilities due to life history, behavior, or other intrinsic factors, such as migration; population structure and niche requirements; threats from extrinsic factors such as the form of exploitation, introduced species, habitat degradation and destruction, and stochastic events; or decreases in recruitment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Listing a species in Appendix II due to actual or potential threats.</E> Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix II if it is or may be affected by trade and meets at least one of the criteria for listing in Appendix II based on actual or potential threats to that species. These criteria are:</P>
              <P>(1) It is known, or can be inferred or projected, that the regulation of trade is necessary to avoid the species becoming eligible for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future.</P>
              <P>(2) It is known, or can be inferred or projected, that the regulation of trade in the species is required to ensure that the harvest of specimens from the wild is not reducing the wild population to a level at which its survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Listing a species in Appendix II due to similarity of appearance or other factors.</E> Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix II if it meets either of the criteria for listing in Appendix II due to similarity of appearance or other factors. These criteria are:</P>
              <P>(1) The specimens of the species in the form in which they are traded resemble specimens of a species listed in Appendix II due to criteria in paragraph (c) of this section or in Appendix I, such that enforcement officers who encounter specimens of such similar CITES species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between them.</P>
              <P>(2) There are compelling reasons other than those in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to ensure that effective control of trade in currently listed species is achieved.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other issues.</E> We will evaluate any potential changes to the Appendices, taking into consideration other issues, including but not limited to, split-listing, annotation, listings of higher taxa and hybrids, and specific listing issues <PRTPAGE P="225"/>related to plants and commercially exploited aquatic species.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Precautionary measures.</E> We will evaluate any potential transfers from Appendix I to II or removal of species from the Appendices in the context of precautionary measures.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Proposal.</E> If a Party determines that a taxon qualifies for inclusion in or removal from Appendix I or II, or transfer from one Appendix to another, a proposal may be submitted to the Secretariat for consideration by the CoP.</P>
              <P>(1) The proposal should indicate the intent of the specific action (such as inclusion in Appendix I or II); be specific and accurate as to the parts and derivatives to be included in the listing; ensure that any proposed annotation is consistent with existing annotations; state the criteria against which the proposal is to be judged; and provide a justification for the basis on which the species meets the relevant criteria.</P>
              <P>(2) The proposal must be in a prescribed format. Contact the U.S. Scientific Authority for a copy (see § 23.7).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the criteria for listing species in Appendix III?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Article XVI of the Treaty sets out the procedures for amending Appendix III.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General procedure.</E> A Party may unilaterally, at any time, submit a request to list a species in Appendix III to the CITES Secretariat. The listing will become effective 90 days after the Secretariat notifies the Parties of the request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Criteria for listing.</E> For a Party to list a species in Appendix III, all of the following criteria must be met:</P>
              <P>(1) The species must be native to the country listing the species.</P>
              <P>(2) The species must be protected under that country's laws or regulations to prevent or restrict exploitation and control trade, and the laws or regulations are being implemented.</P>
              <P>(3) The species is in international trade, and there are indications that the cooperation of other Parties would help to control illegal trade.</P>
              <P>(4) The listing Party must inform the Management Authorities of other range countries, the known major importing countries, the Secretariat, and the Animals Committee or the Plants Committee that it is considering the listing and seek their opinions on the potential effects of the listing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annotation.</E> The listing Party may annotate the Appendix-III listing to include only specific parts, products, derivatives, or life stages, as long as the Secretariat is notified of the annotation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">U.S. procedure.</E> The procedure to list a species native to the United States in Appendix III is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) We will consult with and solicit comments from all States and Tribes where the species occurs and all other range countries.</P>
              <P>(2) We will publish a proposed rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to solicit comments from the public.</P>

              <P>(3) If after evaluating the comments received and available information we determine the species should be listed in Appendix III, we will publish a final rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and notify the Secretariat of the listing.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Removing a species from Appendix III.</E> We will monitor the international trade in Appendix-III species listed by us and periodically evaluate whether each species continues to meet the listing criteria in paragraph (c) of this section. We will remove a species from Appendix III provided all of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) International trade in the species is very limited. As a general guide, we will consider removal when exports involve fewer than 5 shipments per year or fewer than 100 individual animals or plants.</P>
              <P>(2) Legal and illegal trade in the species, including international trade or interstate commerce, is determined not to be a concern.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Transferring a species from Appendix III to Appendix I or II.</E> If, after monitoring the trade and evaluating the status of an Appendix-III species we listed, we determine that the species meets the criteria in § 23.89(b) through (d) of this section for listing in Appendix I or II, we will consider whether to submit a proposal to amend the listing at the next CoP.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> Amendments to the CITES list are effective as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Appendix-I and -II species listings adopted at the CoP are effective 90 days after the last day of the CoP, unless otherwise specified in the proposal.</P>
              <P>(2) Appendix-I and -II species listings adopted between CoPs by postal procedures are effective 120 days after the Secretariat has communicated comments and recommendations on the listing to the Parties if the Secretariat does not receive an objection to the proposed amendment from a Party.</P>
              <P>(3) Appendix-III species listings are effective 90 days after the date the Secretariat has communicated such listings to the Parties. A listing Party may withdraw a species from the list at any time by notifying the Secretariat. The withdrawal is effective 30 days after the Secretariat has communicated the withdrawal to the Parties.</P>

              <P>(a) The regulations in this subchapter govern general administration of units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, public notice of changes in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy regarding Refuge System units, issuance of permits required on Refuge System units and other administrative aspects involving the management of various units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The regulations in this subchapter apply to areas of land and water held by the United States in fee title and to property interests in such land and water in less than fee, including but not limited to easements. For areas held in less than fee, the regulations in this subchapter apply only to the extent that the property interest held by the United States may be affected. The regulations in this subchapter also apply to and govern those areas of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal over which management responsibility has been transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-402, 106 Stat. 1961), before their establishment as a refuge and inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System.</P>
              <P>(b) All national wildlife refuges are maintained for the primary purpose of developing a national program of wildlife and ecological conservation and rehabilitation. These refuges are established for the restoration, preservation, development and management of wildlife and wildlands habitat; for the protection and preservation of endangered or threatened species and their habitat; and for the management of wildlife and wildlands to obtain the maximum benefits from these resources.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 25.21</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>When and how do we open and close areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System to public access and use or continue a use?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided below, all areas included in the National Wildlife Refuge System are closed to public access until and unless we open the area for a use or uses in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee), the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k-460k-4) and this subchapter C. See 50 CFR 36 for details on use and access restrictions, and the public participation and closure process established for Alaska national wildlife refuges. We may open an area by regulation, individual permit, or public notice, in accordance with § 25.31 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(b) We may open a national wildlife refuge for any refuge use, or expand, renew, or extend an existing refuge use only after the Refuge Manager determines that it is a compatible use and not inconsistent with any applicable law. Lands subject to the patent restrictions imposed by Section 22(g) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act are subject to the compatibility requirements of Parts 25 and 26 of 50 CFR except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) We will complete compatibility determinations for uses of Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 22(g) lands in compliance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Refuge managers will work with 22(g) landowners in implementation of these regulations. The landowners should contact the Refuge Manager in advance of initiating a use and request a compatibility determination. After a compatibility determination is requested, refuge managers have no longer than ninety (90) days to complete the compatibility determination and notify the landowner of the finding by providing a copy of the compatibility determination or to inform the landowner of the specific reasons for delay. If a refuge manager believes that a finding of not compatible is likely, the Refuge Manager will notify the landowner prior to rendering a decision to encourage dialog on how the proposed use might be modified to be compatible.</P>
              <P>(ii) Refuge managers will allow all uses proposed by 22(g) landowners when the Refuge Manager determines the use to be compatible with refuge purposes.</P>
              <P>(iii) Compatibility determinations will include only evaluations of how the proposed use would affect the ability of the refuge to meet its mandated purposes. The National Wildlife Refuge System mission will not be considered in the evaluation. Refuge purposes will include both pre-ANILCA purposes and those established by ANILCA, so long as they do not conflict. If conflicts arise, ANILCA purposes will take precedence.</P>
              <P>(iv) A determination that a use is not compatible may be appealed by the landowner to the Regional Director. The appeal must be submitted in writing within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the determination. The appeals process provided for in 50 CFR 36.41(i) (3) through (5) will apply.</P>
              <P>(v) Compatibility determinations for proposed uses of 22(g) lands will only evaluate the effects of the use on the adjacent refuge lands, and the ability of that refuge to achieve its purposes, not on the effects of the proposed use to the 22(g) lands.</P>

              <P>(vi) Compatibility determinations for 22(g) lands that a use is compatible are <PRTPAGE P="233"/>not subject to re-evaluation unless the use changes significantly, significant new information is made available that could affect the compatibility determination, or if requested by the landowner.</P>
              <P>(vii) Refuge comprehensive conservation plans will not include 22(g) lands, and compatibility determinations affecting such lands will not to be automatically re-evaluated when the plans are routinely updated.</P>
              <P>(viii) Refuge special use permits will not be required for compatible uses of 22(g) lands. Special conditions necessary to ensure a proposed use is compatible may be included in the compatibility determination and must be complied with for the use to be considered compatible.</P>
              <P>(c) The Refuge Manager may temporarily allow or initiate any refuge use without making a compatibility determination if necessary to protect the health and safety of the public or any fish or wildlife population.</P>
              <P>(d) When we add lands to the National Wildlife Refuge System, the Refuge Manager will identify, prior to acquisition, withdrawal, transfer, reclassification, or donation of those lands, existing wildlife-dependent recreational public uses (if any) determined to be compatible that we will permit to continue on an interim basis, pending completion of the comprehensive conservation plan for the national wildlife refuge. We will make these compatibility determinations in accordance with procedures in § 26.41 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) In the event of a threat or emergency endangering the health and safety of the public or property or to protect the resources of the area, the Refuge Manager may close or curtail refuge uses of all or any part of an opened area to public access and use in accordance with the provisions in § 25.31, without advance notice. See 50 CFR 36.42 for procedures on closing Alaska national wildlife refuges.</P>
              <P>(f) We will re-evaluate compatibility determinations for existing wildlife-dependent recreational uses when conditions under which the use is permitted change significantly, or if there is significant new information regarding the effects of the use, or concurrently with the preparation or revision of a comprehensive conservation plan, or at least every 15 years, whichever is earlier. In addition, a refuge manager always may re-evaluate the compatibility of a use at any time.</P>
              <P>(g) Except for uses specifically authorized for a period longer than 10 years (such as right-of-ways), we will re-evaluate compatibility determinations for all existing uses other than wildlife-dependent recreational uses when conditions under which the use is permitted change significantly, or if there is significant new information regarding the effects of the use, or at least every 10 years, whichever is earlier. In addition, a refuge manager always may re-evaluate the compatibility of a use at any time.</P>
              <P>(h) For uses in existence on November 17, 2000 that were specifically authorized for a period longer than 10 years (such as right-of-ways), our compatibility re-evaluation will examine compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization, not the authorization itself. We will frequently monitor and review the activity to ensure that the permittee carries out all permit terms and conditions. However, the Service will request modifications to the terms and conditions of these permits from the permittee if the Service determines that such changes are necessary to ensure that the use remains compatible. After November 17, 2000 no uses will be permitted or re-authorized, for a period longer than 10 years, unless the terms and conditions for such long-term permits specifically allows for modifications to the terms and conditions, if necessary to ensure compatibility. We will make a new compatibility determination prior to extending or renewing such long-term uses at the expiration of the authorization. When we prepare a compatibility determination for re-authorization of an existing right-of-way, we will base our analysis on the existing conditions with the use in place, not from a pre-use perspective.</P>
              <P>(i) When we re-evaluate a use for compatibility, we will take a fresh look at the use and prepare a new compatibility determination following the procedure outlined in 50 CFR 26.41.</P>

              <P>(a) The provisions of this subsection shall govern the regulation of activities that affect easement interests acquired by the United States.

              <P>(b) We require permits for use of easement areas administered by us where proposed activities may affect the property interest acquired by the United States.

We may grant special use permits to owners of servient estates, or to third parties with the owner's agreement, by the Regional Director or a designee, upon written determination that such permitted use is compatible.

              <P>(c) In instances where the third applicant is a governmental entity which has acquired a partial interest in the servient estate by subsequent condemnation, a special use permit may be granted to the governmental entity without the servient estate owner's agreement if the regional director or his or her designee determines:</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the process for determining if a use of a national wildlife refuge is a compatible use?</SUBJECT>

              <P>The Refuge Manager will not initiate or permit a new use of a national wildlife refuge or expand, renew, or extend an existing use of a national wildlife refuge, unless the Refuge Manager has determined that the use is a compatible use. This section provides guidelines for making compatibility determinations, and procedures for documenting compatibility determinations <PRTPAGE P="259"/>and for periodic review of compatibility determinations. We will usually complete compatibility determinations as part of the comprehensive conservation plan or step-down management plan process for individual uses, specific use programs, or groups of related uses described in the plan. We will make all compatibility determinations in writing.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">What information do we include in a compatibility determination?</E> All compatibility determinations will include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The proposed or existing use;</P>
              <P>(2) The name of the national wildlife refuge;</P>
              <P>(3) The authorities used to establish the national wildlife refuge;</P>
              <P>(4) The purpose(s) of the national wildlife refuge;</P>
              <P>(5) The National Wildlife Refuge System mission;</P>
              <P>(6) The nature and extent of the use including the following:</P>
              <P>(i) What is the use? Is the use a priority public use?;</P>
              <P>(ii) Where would the use be conducted?;</P>
              <P>(iii) When would the use be conducted?;</P>
              <P>(iv) How would the use be conducted?; and</P>
              <P>(v) Why is the use being proposed?.</P>
              <P>(7) An analysis of costs for administering and managing each use;</P>
              <P>(8) The anticipated impacts of the use on the national wildlife refuge's purposes and the National Wildlife Refuge System mission;</P>
              <P>(9) The amount of opportunity for public review and comment provided;</P>
              <P>(10) Whether the use is compatible or not compatible (does it or will it materially interfere with or detract from the fulfillment of the National Wildlife Refuge System mission or the purpose(s) of the national wildlife refuge);</P>
              <P>(11) Stipulations necessary to ensure compatibility;</P>
              <P>(12) A logical explanation describing how the proposed use would, or would not, materially interfere with or detract from the fulfillment of the National Wildlife Refuge System mission or the purpose(s) of the national wildlife refuge;</P>
              <P>(13) The Refuge Manager's signature and date signed; and</P>
              <P>(14) The Regional Chief's concurrence signature and date signed.</P>
              <P>(15) The mandatory 10- or 15-year re-evaluation date.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Making a use compatible through replacement of lost habitat values or other compensatory mitigation.</E> We will not allow compensatory mitigation to make a proposed refuge use compatible, except by replacement of lost habitat values as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If we cannot make the proposed use compatible with stipulations we cannot allow the use.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Existing right-of-ways.</E> We will not make a compatibility determination and will deny any request for maintenance of an existing right-of-way which will affect a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System, unless: the design adopts appropriate measures to avoid resource impacts and includes provisions to ensure no net loss of habitat quantity and quality; restored or replacement areas identified in the design are afforded permanent protection as part of the national wildlife refuge or wetland management district affected by the maintenance; and all restoration work is completed by the applicant prior to any title transfer or recording of the easement, if applicable. Maintenance of an existing right-of-way includes minor expansion or minor realignment to meet safety standards.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of uses that are not compatible.</E> When we determine an existing use is not compatible, we will expeditiously terminate or modify the use to make it compatible. Except with written authorization by the Director, this process of termination or modification will not exceed 6 months from the date that the compatibility determination is signed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>May we allow economic uses on national wildlife refuges?</SUBJECT>
              <P>We may only authorize public or private economic use of the natural resources of any national wildlife refuge, in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 715s, where we determine that the use contributes to the achievement of the national wildlife refuge purposes or the National Wildlife Refuge System mission. We may authorize economic use by appropriate permit only when we have determined the use on a national wildlife refuge to be compatible. Persons exercising economic privileges on national wildlife refuges will be subject to the applicable provisions of this subchapter and of other applicable laws and regulations governing national wildlife refuges. Permits for economic use will contain such terms and conditions that we determine to be necessary for the proper administration of the resources. Economic use in this section includes but is not limited to grazing livestock, harvesting hay and stock feed, removing timber, firewood or other natural products of the soil, removing shell, sand or gravel, cultivating areas, or engaging in operations that facilitate approved programs on national wildlife refuges.</P>

No map exhibit is required, however, the affected land should be described in the letter or shown on a map sketch. If the requested right-of-way will not adversely affect the United States' interest, the Regional Director may issue a letter stating that the interest of the United States to the right-of-way easement would not be affected provided there would be no <PRTPAGE P="271"/>objection to a right-of-way by the fee owner. If the interest of the United States will be affected, application for the right-of-way must be submitted in accordance with procedures set out in § 29.21-2.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other lands outside the National Wildlife Refuge System.</E> Rights-of-way on or over other lands will be granted in accordance with controlling authorities cited in 43 CFR part 2800, or for oil and gas pipelines under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 449; 30 U.S.C. 185) as amended by Pub.

              <SUBJECT>Nature of interest granted.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Where the land administered by the Secretary is owned in fee by the United States and the right-of-way is compatible with the objectives of the area, permit or easement may be approved and granted by the Regional Director. Generally an easement or permit will be issued for a term of 50 years or so long as it is used for the purpose <PRTPAGE P="273"/>granted, or for a lesser term when considered appropriate. For rights-of-way granted under authority of section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, for pipelines for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced therefrom, the grant may be for a term not to exceed 30 years and the right-of-way may not exceed 50 feet, plus the area occupied by the pipeline and its related facilities unless the Regional Director finds, and records the reasons for his finding, that, in his judgment, a wider right-of-way is necessary for operation and maintenance after construction, or to protect the environment or public safety. Related facilities include but are not limited to valves, pump stations, supporting structures, bridges, monitoring and communication devices, surge and storage tanks, terminals, etc. However, a temporary permit supplementing a right-of-way may be granted for additional land needed during construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the pipeline, or to protect the natural environment or public safety.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise provided, no interest granted shall give the grantee any right whatever to remove any material, earth, or stone for construction or other purpose, except that stone or earth necessarily removed from the right-of-way in the construction of a project may be used elsewhere along the same right-of-way in the construction of the same project.</P>

              <P>(a) Any right-of-way easement or permit granted will be subject to outstanding rights, if any, in third parties.</P>
              <P>(b) An applicant, by accepting an easement or permit agrees to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Regional Director in the granting document. Such terms and conditions shall include the following, unless waived in part by the Regional Director, and may include additional special stipulations at his discretion. See § 29.21-8 for special requirements for electric powerlines and § 29.21-9 for special requirements for oil and gas pipelines.</P>
              <P>(1) To comply with State and Federal laws applicable to the project within which the easement or permit is granted, and to the lands which are included in the right-of-way, and lawful existing regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(2) To clear and keep clear the lands within the easement or permit area to the extent and in the manner directed by the project manager in charge; and to dispose of all vegetative and other material cut, uprooted, or otherwise accumulated during the construction and maintenance of the project in such a manner as to decrease the fire hazard and also in accordance with such instructions as the project manager may specify.</P>
              <P>(3) To prevent the disturbance or removal of any public land survey monument or project boundary monument unless and until the applicant has requested and received from the Regional Director approval of measures the applicant will take to perpetuate the location of aforesaid monument.</P>
              <P>(4) To take such soil and resource conservation and protection measures, including weed control on the land covered by the easement or permit as the project manager in charge may request.</P>
              <P>(5) To do everything reasonably within his power, both independently and on request of any duly authorized representative of the United States, to prevent and suppress fires on or near, lands to be occupied under the easement or permit area, including making available such construction and maintenance forces as may be reasonably obtainable for the suppression of such fires.</P>
              <P>(6) To rebuild and repair such roads, fences, structures, and trails as may be destroyed or injured by construction work and upon request by the Regional Director, to build and maintain necessary and suitable crossings for all roads and trails that intersect the works constructed, maintained, or operated under the right-of-way.</P>

              <P>(7) To pay the United States the full value for all damages to the lands or other property of the United States caused by him or by his employees, <PRTPAGE P="274"/>contractors, or employees of the contractors, and to indemnify the United States against any liability for damages to life, person or property arising from the occupancy or use of the lands under the easement or permit, except where the easement or permit is granted hereunder to a State or other governmental agency which has no legal power to assume such a liability with respect to damages caused by it to lands or property, such agency in lieu thereof agrees to repair all such damages. Where the easement of permit involves lands which are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, the holder or his employees, contractors, or agents of the contractors, shall be liable to third parties for injuries incurred in connection with the easement or permit area. Grants of easements or permits involving special hazards will impose liability without fault for injury and damage to the land and property of the United States up to a specified maximum limit commensurate with the foreseeable risks or hazards presented. The amount of no-fault liability for each occurrence is hereby limited to no more than $1,000,000.</P>
              <P>(8) To notify promptly the project manager in charge of the amount of merchantable timber, if any, which will be cut, removed, or destroyed in the construction and maintenance of the project, and to pay the United States in advance of construction such sum of money as the project manager may determine to be the full stumpage value of the timber to be so cut, removed, or destroyed.</P>
              <P>(9) That all or any part of the easement or permit granted may be terminated by the Regional Director, for failure to comply with any or all of the terms or conditions of the grant, or for abandonment. A rebuttable presumption of abandonment is raised by deliberate failure of the holder to use for any continuous 2-year period the easement or permit for the purpose for which it was granted or renewed. In the event of noncompliance of abandonment, the Regional Director will notify in writing the holder of the easement or permit of his intention to suspend or terminate such grant 60 days from the date of the notice, stating the reasons therefor, unless prior to that time the holder completes such corrective actions as are specified in the notice. The Regional Director may grant an extension of time within which to complete corrective actions when, in his judgment, extenuating circumstances not within the holder's control such as adverse weather conditions, disturbance to wildlife during breeding periods or periods of peak concentration, or other compelling reasons warrant. Should the holder of a right-of-way issued under authority of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, fail to take corrective action within the 60-day period, the Regional Director will provide for an administrative proceeding pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554, prior to a final Departmental decision to suspend or terminate the easement or permit. In the case of all other right-of-way holders, failure to take corrective action within the 60-day period will result in a determination by the Regional Director to suspend or terminate the easement or permit. No administrative proceeding shall be required where the easement or permit terminates under its terms.</P>
              <P>(10) To restore the land to its original condition to the satisfaction of the Regional Director so far as it is reasonably possible to do so upon revocation and/or termination of the easement or permit, unless this requirement is waived in writing by the Regional Director. Termination also includes permits or easements that terminate under the terms of the grant.</P>
              <P>(11) To keep the project manager informed at all times of his address, and, in case of corporations, of the address of its principal place of business and the names and addresses of its principal officers.</P>
              <P>(12) That in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the project, he shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin and shall require an identical provision to be included in all subcontracts.</P>

              <P>(13) That the grant of the easement or permit shall be subject to the express condition that the exercise thereof will not unduly interfere with the management, administration, or disposal by the United States of the land affected thereby. The applicant agrees <PRTPAGE P="275"/>and consents to the occupancy and use by the United States, its grantees, permittees, or lessees of any part of the easement of permit area not actually occupied for the purpose of the granted rights to the extent that it does not interfere with the full and safe utilization thereof by the holder. The holder of an easement or permit also agrees that authorized representatives of the United States shall have the right of access to the easement or permit area for the purpose of making inspections and monitoring the construction, operation and maintenance of facilities.</P>
              <P>(14) That the easement or permit herein granted shall be subject to the express covenant that any facility constructed thereon will be modified or adapted, if such is found by the Regional Director to be necessary, without liability or expense to the United States, so that such facility will not conflict with the use and occupancy of the land for any authorized works which may hereafter be constructed thereon under the authority of the United States. Any such modification will be planned and scheduled so as not to interfere unduly with or to have minimal effect upon continuity of energy and delivery requirements.</P>
              <P>(15) That the easement or permit herein granted shall be for the specific use described and may not be construed to include the further right to authorize any other use within the easement or permit area unless approved in writing by the Regional Director.</P>

              <P>(a) Payment for use and occupancy of lands under the regulations of this subpart will be required and will be for fair market value as determined by appraisal by the Regional Director. At the discretion of the Regional Director, the payment may be a lump sum payment or an annual fair market rental payment, to be made in advance. If any Federal, State or local agency is exempted from such payment by and any other provision of Federal law, such agency shall otherwise compensate the Service by any other means agreeable to the Regional Director, including, <PRTPAGE P="276"/>but not limited to, making other land available or the loan of equipment or personnel, except that any such compensation shall relate to, and be consistent with the objectives of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Regional Director may waive such requirement for compensation if he finds such requirement impracticable or unnecessary.</P>
              <P>(b) When annual rental payments are used, such rates shall be reviewed by the Regional Director at any time not less than 5 years after the grant of the permit, right-of-way, or easement or the last revision of charges thereunder, The Regional Director will furnish a notice in writing to the holder of an easement or permit of intent to impose new charges to reflect fair market value commencing with the ensuing charge year. The revised charges will be effective unless the holder files an appeal in accordance with § 29.22.</P>

                <P>(a) You are responsible for completing reclamation of your disturbances, whether within or outside your permit area, in accordance with this subpart and the terms of your permit. If you fail to properly complete reclamation, you will be liable for the full costs of completing the reclamation.

                <P>(h) The operator must maintain records of the withheld information until the later of the Service's release of the operator's financial assurance or 7 years after completion of operations on refuge lands. Any subsequent operator will be responsible for maintaining access to records required by this paragraph during its operation of the well. The operator will be deemed to be maintaining the records if it can promptly provide the complete and accurate information to the Service, even if the information is in the custody of its owner.</P>
                <P>(i) If any of the chemical identity information required in this subpart is withheld, the operator must provide the generic chemical name in the submission required. The generic chemical name must be only as nonspecific as is necessary to protect the confidential chemical identity, and should be the same as or no less descriptive than the generic chemical name provided to the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

              <P>The opening of a wildlife refuge area to hunting will be dependent upon the provisions of law applicable to the area and upon a determination by the Secretary that the opening of the area to the hunting of migratory game birds, upland game, or big game will be compatible with the principles of sound wildlife management and will otherwise be in the public interest. The opening or closing of wildlife refuge areas to hunting shall be in accordance with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Lands acquired pursuant to the Act of May 18, 1948 (62 Stat. 238, 16 U.S.C. 695) will be opened to hunting only after it has been determined that the major portion of the crops in the vicinity of the area involved have been harvested, that the period of susceptibility of such crops to wildfowl depredation has passed, or that the possibility of these crops being damaged by waterfowl is minor. Lands acquired as “waterfowl production areas” shall annually be open to the hunting of migratory game birds, upland game, and big game subject to the provisions of State law and regulations and the pertinent provisions of parts 25 through 31 of this subchapter: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That all forms of hunting or entry on all or any part of individual areas may be temporarily suspended by posting upon occasions of unusual or critical conditions of, or affecting land, water, vegetation, or wildlife populations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Opening of wildlife refuge areas to fishing.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Wildlife refuge areas may be opened to sport fishing only after a determination is made that this activity is compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established. In addition, the sport fishing program must be consistent with principles of sound fishery management and otherwise be in the public interest. The opening or closing of wildlife refuge areas to fishing is subject to the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Lands acquired as “waterfowl production areas” are open to sport fishing subject to the provisions of State laws and regulations and the pertinent provisions of parts 25 through 31 of this subchapter: <E T="03">Provided,</E> that fishing or entry on all or any part of individual areas may be temporarily suspended by posting upon occasions of unusual or critical conditions of, or affecting, land, water, vegetation or fish and wildlife populations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The term <E T="03">fee area</E> means any area which was acquired in fee by the United States and is administered, either solely or primarily, by the Secretary through the Service.</P>
            <P>(b) The term <E T="03">reserve area</E> means any area of land withdrawn from the public domain and administered, either solely or primarily, by the Secretary through the Service. For the purpose of these regulations, reserve areas also include lands in Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, which were initially administered by the United States through Act of Congress, Executive Order, Public Land Order or Proclamation of the President and administered, either solely or primarily, by the Secretary through the Service.</P>
            <P>(c) The term <E T="03">county</E> means any county, parish, organized or unorganized borough, township or municipality, or other unit of local government that is the primary collector for general purpose real property taxes where fee areas and/or reserve areas are located. For the purpose of sharing revenues, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands shall each be treated as a county.</P>
            <P>(d) The term <E T="03">fund</E> means the revenues received by the Service from (1) the sale or disposition of animals, salmonoid carcasses and eggs, products of the soil (including, but not limited to, timber, hay, and grass), minerals, shells, sand, and gravel; (2) leases for public accommodations or facilities incidental to, but not in conflict with, the basic purpose of such areas; and (3) other privileges, including industrial leases at Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, Illinois, as authorized by Section 8 of Pub. L. 95-616, approved October 27, 1978. The Service may pay from such fund any necessary expenses incurred in connection with the revenue producing and revenue sharing activity. The fund shall also include any appropriations authorized by the Act to make up any difference between the total amount of receipts after payments of expenses and the total amount of payments due the counties.</P>
            <P>(e) The term <E T="03">net receipts</E> means the amount of revenue collected by the Service from an area (including fee land and/or reserve land) after the deduction of necessary expenses incurred in producing the particular revenues.</P>
            <P>(f) The term <E T="03">fair market value</E> means the amount in terms of money for which in all probability a property would be sold if exposed for sale in the open market by a seller who is willing but not obligated to sell, allowing a reasonable time to find a buyer who is willing but not obligated to buy, both parties having full knowledge of all the uses to which the property is adapted, and for which it is capable of being used.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Distribution of revenues.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Act provides that the Secretary, at the end of each fiscal year, shall pay to each county out of the fund:</P>
            <P>(a) For reserve areas, an amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts, collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such area, provided that when any such area is situated in more than one county, the distributive share to each from the aforesaid receipts shall be proportional to its acreage of such reserve area.</P>
            <P>(b) For fee areas, whichever of the following is greater:</P>
            <P>(1) An amount equal to 75¢ per acre for the total acreage of the fee area located within such county.</P>
            <P>(2) An amount equal to three-fourths of one per centum of the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary, of that portion of the fee area (excluding any improvements thereto made after the date of Federal acquisition) which is located within such county. For those areas of fee land within the National Wildlife Refuge System as of September 30, 1977, the amount of payment based on fair market value will not be less than the amount paid on the adjusted cost basis as in effect at that time. Actual cost, or appraised value in case of donation, will be used for lands acquired during fiscal year 1978. For those areas of fee lands added to lands administered by the Service after September 30, 1978, by purchase, donation, or otherwise, fair market value shall be determined by appraisal as of the date said areas are administered by the Service.</P>
            <P>(3) An amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such fee area during such fiscal year; but if a fee area is located in two or more counties, the amount each such county is entitled to shall be the amount which bears to such 25 per centum, the same ratio as that portion of the fee area acreage which is within such county bears to the total acreage of such fee area.</P>
            <P>(c) In accordance with section 5(A) of the act, each county which receives a payment under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, with respect to any fee area or reserve area, shall distribute that payment to those units of local government which have incurred the loss or reduction of real property tax revenues because of the existence of such area in accordance with the following guidelines.</P>
            <FP>The local units of government entitled to this distribution will be those such as, but not limited to, cities, towns, townships, school districts, and the county itself in appropriate cases, which levy and collect real property taxes separately from the county or other primary taxing authority or those for which a tax is separately stated on a consolidated tax bill of the primary taxing authority in areas wherein eligible lands are located. The amount of distribution or passthrough to which each unit of local government shall be entitled shall be in the same proportion as its current tax loss bears to the current whole tax loss.</FP>
            <FP>This proportion may be determined; from representative tax bills for the area; by construction by using assessments and millage rates; or by other suitable methods to achieve an equitable result. An example using the representative tax bill method is:</FP>

            <P>The Secretary shall make fair market value appraisals of areas administered by the Service within five years after October 17, 1978, beginning with areas established earliest. All areas for which payments were not authorized prior to fiscal year 1979 (<E T="03">i.e.</E>; fish hatcheries, administrative sites, and research stations) shall be included in the areas appraised during the first fiscal year. Once appraised, areas shall be reappraised on a schedule of at least once every five years. Until areas are appraised, the fair market value for the purposes of this regulation shall be the adjusted cost as of September 30, 1978, except that fee lands added to such areas after that date shall be on the basis of fair market value.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fair market value appraisals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Fee areas administered by the Service will be appraised in accordance with standard appraisal procedures in order to estimate the fair market value of each area as a whole. The evaluation will be premised on an appropriate determination of highest and best use in accordance with existing or potential zoning, the present condition of the land and the general economic situation in the vicinity. Standard appraisal techniques will involve a market data comparison of these areas with similar properties which have sold recently in the local market. These techniques may also include consideration of potential income and development of the cost approach for special use properties having limited marketability. An appropriate evaluation of these areas will also take into consideration a discount for size as recognized by the market for large properties where applicable. The appraisals will be accomplished by the regional director, using Service staff appraisers or private appraisers contracted by the Service.</P>
            <FP>The Act requires that improvements placed upon the land after the date of Federal Acquisition be excluded from the fair market value. The only structures that will be included in the appraisal are those that were present at the time of Federal acquisition and have not been the subject of substantial renovation or modification with Federal funds. Evaluation of improvements will be based on their contributory value to the area as determined by the highest and best use study. Lands occupied by improvements not subject to appraisal will be valued as though unimproved.</FP>
            <FP>The appraisals will be reviewed by the Service's review appraisers and the determination of the regional director as to fair market value shall be final and conclusive and shall be the basis for computation of revenue sharing payments.</FP>

            <P>(b) Any affected county may protest the results of the computations of its payments to the regional director in charge of the State and county affected. See § 29.21-2(c) for a listing of the regional directors of the Service.</P>
            <P>(c) Any protesting county shall submit sufficient evidence to show error in the computation or the data from which the computations are made.</P>

            <P>(e) The regional director shall consult with the affected county to resolve conflicts in the computations and/or data. The regional director shall make a determination as to the correct payment, which determination shall be final and conclusive.</P>

              <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of subchapter C of title 50 CFR the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses is permitted within Alaska National Wildlife Refuges except at those times and in those areas restricted or closed by the Refuge Manager.</P>
              <P>(b) The Refuge Manager may restrict or close a route or area to the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams or other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses if the Refuge Manager determines that such use is causing or is likely to cause an adverse impact on public health and safety, resource protection, protection of historic or scientific values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened species, or other purposes and values for which the refuge was established.</P>
              <P>(c) No restrictions or closures shall be imposed without notice and a public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate.

              <P>(a) The taking of fish and wildlife for sport hunting, trapping, and sport fishing is authorized in accordance with applicable State and Federal law and such laws are hereby adopted and made a part of these regulations; <E T="03">Provided however,</E> That the Refuge Manager, pursuant to § 36.42, may designate areas where, and establish periods when, no taking of a particular population of fish or wildlife shall be permitted.</P>

              <P>(b) The exercise of valid commercial fishing rights or privileges obtained pursuant to existing law, including any use of refuge areas for campsites, cabins, motorized vehicles, and aircraft landing directly incident to the exercise of such rights or privileges, is authorized; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the Refuge Manager may restrict or prohibit the exercise of these rights or privileges or uses of federally owned lands directly incident to such exercise if he determines, after conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, that they are inconsistent with the purposes of the refuge and that they constitute a significant expansion of commercial fishing activities within such refuge beyond the level of such activities in 1979.</P>
              <P>(c) The following provisions shall apply to any person while engaged in the taking of fish and wildlife within an Alaska National Wildlife Refuge:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Trapping and sport hunting.</E> (i) Each person shall secure and possess all required State licenses and shall comply with the applicable provisions of State law unless further restricted by Federal law;</P>

              <P>(e) Nothing in these rules shall be interpreted as waiving the requirements of other fish and wildlife conservation statutes such as the Airborne Hunting Act or those provisions of subchapter C of title 50 CFR regarding the taking of depredating wildlife. Animal control programs shall only be conducted in accordance with a special use permit issued by the Refuge Manager.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Existing cabin</E> shall mean any cabin situated on Federal lands before December 2, 1980. A cabin legally situated on lands that subsequently become refuge will also be considered an “existing” cabin providing the applicant <PRTPAGE P="525"/>meets the appropriate application deadlines.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Family</E> shall include the spouse (including what is known as a common-law relationship), children by birth or adoption, and other blood relatives within the second degree of kindred.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Guest</E> shall mean a person who occasionally visits the permittee in the cabin. This term does not include clients using commercial cabins.</P>

                <E T="03">New cabin</E> shall mean any permitted cabin constructed on refuge lands after December 2, 1980. This may also include a cabin whose claimant failed to meet the application deadline for existing cabins but is otherwise a permitted cabin.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Other related structures</E> shall mean those structures or devices essential to the activities for which the cabin special use permit is issued. This includes but is not limited to outdoor toilets, food caches, storage sheds, and fish drying racks.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Private recreational use</E> shall mean a use associated with leisure activities, not including bona fide subsistence uses or authorized commercial uses.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Public use cabin</E> shall mean a cabin owned and administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service and available for use by the public.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">All cabins.</E> The regulations in this paragraph (b) shall apply to all cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. The regulations in this paragraph (b) do not apply to temporary facilities: any structure or man-made improvement which can readily be completely dismantled and removed from the site when the period of authorized use is terminated.</P>
              <P>(1) A special use permit is required to construct, use and/or occupy a cabin on Fish and Wildlife Service lands within the refuge. The permit may also authorize the use of related structures and other necessary appurtenances.</P>
              <P>(2) After adequate public notice has been given, unclaimed cabins become the property of the Federal Government. Adequate public notice shall include: Posting notices of trespass on unclaimed cabins; publication of notices of trespass in Anchorage and Fairbanks newspapers and in at least one local newspaper if available; and posting notices of trespass at appropriate community post offices. A Government-owned cabin may be used for refuge administration, used for emergency purposes by the public, permitted to another applicant, designated a public use cabin, or destroyed. Disposal of excess cabins and structures will be according to regulations pursuant to title 41, chapter 114 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) Willful noncompliance with the conditions and stipulations of a special use permit shall be considered grounds to invoke the administrative process leading to notice and hearing, and possible revocation of the permit. The refuge manager will attempt to resolve problems of noncompliance with the permittee as soon as possible after the situation becomes known. If this effort fails, the refuge manager shall provide written notice to the permittee within 30 days of that date, informing the permittee of noncompliance, giving specific instructions for compliance and providing appropriate time for the permittee to comply.</P>
              <P>(4) No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin for private recreational use or for the private recreational use of an existing cabin.</P>
              <P>(5) Guests are allowed to occupy a cabin only during the activity period identified on the special use permit. Guests occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee shall obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. The guest must have a copy of the letter in his/her possession. In commercial cabins, the permittee or another person listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied by guests or clients.</P>
              <P>(6) A person whose permit application (new or renewal) for a cabin has been denied or whose cabin permit has been revoked by the refuge manager may appeal to the Regional Director as described in § 36.41(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Existing cabins.</E> In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (c) shall apply to all existing cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests.<PRTPAGE P="526"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Where a valid cabin permit or lease was in effect on December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added to the refuge, the refuge manager shall provide for the continuation of the permit or lease under the same conditions. The new permit shall be nontransferable and renewable every five years unless the continuation would directly threaten or significantly impair the purposes for which the refuge was established. The cabin and related structures are the personal property of the claimant and can be removed by him/her upon non-renewal or revocation. The owner of a cabin may sell his/her interest in the cabin to another person; however, the new owner does not automatically qualify for a permit and must apply for a new one.</P>
              <P>(2) To obtain a special use permit for a cabin that was not under permit or lease before December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added to the refuge, a claimant should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Reasonable proof of possessory interest or right to occupy the cabin as shown by affidavit, bill of sale, or other document.</P>
              <P>(ii) Date of construction or acquisition.</P>
              <P>(iii) A sketch or photograph that accurately depicts the cabin and related structures.</P>
              <P>(iv) The dimensions of the cabin and related structures.</P>
              <P>(v) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the cabin and related structures.</P>
              <P>(vi) The claimant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.</P>
              <P>(vii) The claimant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin and related structures are located.</P>
              <P>(viii) A list of family members residing with the claimant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's death (this is not applicable to cabins used for commercial purposes).</P>
              <P>(3) Applications for permits for existing cabins, which are not currently under valid permits, will only be accepted for a period of one year following the effective date of these regulations. However, cabins that were legally located on lands that subsequently become refuge will also be considered “existing” cabins. The owners will have two years following the date the lands become refuge to apply for a permit. Following those dates, all applications for cabins will be for “new” cabins only, no matter when the cabin was built or first used. If ownership is not established within three years after the land becomes refuge, the cabin may be considered abandoned, and it will become Federal property in accordance with Federal regulations.</P>
              <P>(4) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee and his/her family, bona fide partners, and guests.</P>
              <P>(5) Major modification or rehabilitation of an existing cabin must be approved by the refuge manager before construction begins. The modifications will be done by the permittee or designated agent and will remain the property of the permittee. Major additions (e.g., larger than the original cabin) may fall under the ownership provisions for new cabins. Although cabins destroyed by accidents, vandalism or natural causes may be reconstructed, they must be approved by the refuge manager before construction and must meet the construction guidelines for new cabins, even though remaining the property of the claimant.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">New cabins.</E> In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (d) shall apply to all new cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests.</P>

              <P>(1) A nontransferable, five year special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed construction, use and maintenance of the cabin is compatible with refuge purposes and that the cabin use is either directly related to refuge administration or is needed for continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the refuge where the applicant lacks a reasonable off-<PRTPAGE P="527"/>refuge site. In addition, these activities must have historically been supported by the construction and use of cabins in the geographic area. In general, new cabin permits will be given only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence activity. In determining whether to permit the construction, use, and occupancy of cabins or other structures, the refuge manager shall be guided by factors such as other public uses, public health and safety, environmental and resource protection, research activities, protection of historic or scientific values, subsistence uses, endangered or threatened species conservation and other management considerations necessary to ensure that the activities authorized pursuant to a permit are compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established.</P>
              <P>(2) To obtain a special use permit for a new cabin, an applicant should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A sketch that accurately depicts the proposed cabin and related structures.</P>
              <P>(ii) The dimensions of the proposed cabin and related structures.</P>
              <P>(iii) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the proposed cabin and related structures.</P>
              <P>(iv) The applicant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.</P>
              <P>(v) The applicant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the cabin and related structures or in the real property on which the cabin and related structures are located.</P>
              <P>(vi) A list of family members residing with the applicant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's death.</P>
              <P>(3) The permitting instrument shall be a nontransferable renewable five year special use permit. It shall be renewed every five years (upon request) until the death of the original claimant's last immediate family member unless the special use permit has been revoked or the cabin has been abandoned.</P>
              <P>(4) No new cabins will be constructed in designated wilderness areas unless they are built specifically for the administration of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary use.</P>
              <P>(5) New trapping cabins in wilderness will be available for public use to ensure public health and safety.</P>
              <P>(6) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee, and his/her family, bona fide partners, and guests.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Commercial cabins.</E> In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (e) shall apply to all commercial cabins, permittees, clients, guests, and occupants.</P>
              <P>(1) A special use permit is required for all cabins used for commercial purposes. Refuge managers may also issue special use permits that authorize additional commercial use of an existing cabin used for guiding, etc. The use of a new cabin shall be limited to the type of use specified in the original permit. The refuge manager may permit the use of an existing cabin on non-wilderness refuge lands for the exercise of valid commercial fishing rights. Such a permit may be denied if, after conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, it is found that the use is inconsistent with refuge purposes and is a significant expansion of commercial fishing activities within the unit beyond 1979 levels.</P>
              <P>(2) When the commercial fishing or guiding rights associated with a permittee's existing cabin are acquired by a new party, the privilege of using the cabin cannot be sold and the new party does not necessarily qualify for a cabin permit. He/she must apply for a permit and meet the criteria described in this paragraph (e) before issuance of a special use permit by the refuge manager. He/she may not occupy the cabin before issuance of a permit.</P>
              <P>(3) No new commercial cabins will be permitted in wilderness areas.</P>

              <P>(4) Commercial cabins may be occupied only by persons legitimately involved in the commercial enterprise, assistants, employees, their families, guests and clients and only during the <PRTPAGE P="528"/>time that the authorized activity is occurring. The names of those individuals, excluding guests and clients, will be listed on the permit. The permittee or another individual listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied.</P>
              <P>(5) Special use permits for commercial cabins may be renewed annually in conjunction with the special use permit renewal for the commercial activity itself. The cabin permit may be issued for periods of up to five years and is a separate permit from one issued for the commercial activity.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Administrative and government-owned public use cabins.</E> In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (f) apply to all administrative and government-owned cabins.</P>
              <P>(1) The refuge manager can designate those cabins not under permit as administrative cabins to be used for official government business. Administrative cabins may be used by the public during life-threatening emergencies. On a case-by-case basis, they may also be designated as public use cabins when not needed for government purposes. In such cases, the refuge manager must inform the public and post dates or seasons when the cabins are available.</P>
              <P>(2) The refuge manager may designate government-owned cabins as public use cabins. They are only intended for short-term public recreational use and occupancy. The refuge manager may develop an allocation system for managing public use cabins for short-term recreational use. No existing public use cabins shall be removed or new public use cabins constructed within wilderness areas designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 or subsequently designated wilderness areas until the Secretary of the Interior notifies the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.</P>

              <P>(2) The rights granted by this section to historical operators, preferred operators, and Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, are not exclusive. The Refuge Manager may authorize other persons to provide visitor services on refuge lands. Nothing in this section shall require the Refuge Manager to issue a visitor services permit if not otherwise mandated by statute to do so. Nothing in this section shall authorize the Refuge Manager to issue a visitor services permit to a person who is not capable of carrying out its terms and conditions in a satisfactory manner.</P>
              <P>(3) This section does not apply to the guiding of sport hunting or sport fishing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions shall apply to this section:</P>

              <P>(i) On or before January 1, 1979, was lawfully engaged in adequately providing any type of visitor service in a refuge within the scope of paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has continued to lawfully provide that visitor service; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Is otherwise determined by the Refuge Manager to have a right to continue to provide such services or similar services pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Local area</E> means that area in Alaska within 100 miles of the location within a refuge where any of the visitor service is authorized.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Local resident</E> means:</P>
              <P>(i) For <E T="03">individuals.</E> Those individuals that have maintained their primary, permanent residence and business within the local area for the past twelve (12) consecutive months and whenever absent from this primary, permanent residence, have the intention of returning to it. Factors demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent residence and business may include, but are not limited to, the permanent address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, tax returns, and voter registrations.</P>
              <P>(ii) For <E T="03">corporations.</E> A corporation in which the controlling interest is held by an individual or individuals who qualify as “local resident(s)” within the meaning of this section. For non-profit corporations a majority of the board members and a majority of the officers must qualify as “local residents.”</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Native Corporation</E> means the same as defined in section 102(6) of ANILCA.</P>

              <P>(13) <E T="03">Right of first refusal</E> means, as it relates to section 1307(a) of ANILCA, a reasonable opportunity for a historical operator to review a description of the new similar service and the terms and conditions upon which it is to be provided to determine if the historical visitor service operator wishes to provide the service. As it relates to section 1307(c) of ANILCA, it refers to the opportunity for Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated to have the first opportunity to provide new visitor services on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in the Cook Inlet Region.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Visitor services existing on or before January 1, 1979, “historical operators”.</E> (1) A historical operator shall have a right to continue to provide visitor services or similar services within such area, under appropriate terms and conditions, so long as such services are determined by the Refuge Manager to be consistent with the purposes for which the refuge was established. A historical operator must obtain a permit from the refuge manager to conduct the visitor services. The permit shall be for a fixed term and specified area, and shall contain such terms and conditions as are in the public interest. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit may result in cancellation of the authorization and consequent loss of historical operator rights under this section. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Refuge Manager from permitting persons, in addition to historical operators, to provide visitor services in the refuge at the Refuge Manager's discretion so long as historical operators are permitted to conduct a scope or level of visitor services equal to or greater than those provided prior to January 1, 1979, under terms and conditions consistent with this section. A historical operator may be permitted by the Refuge Manager, under separate authority, to increase the scope or level of visitor services provided prior to January 1, 1979, but no historical operating rights shall be obtained in such increase.</P>
              <P>(2) A historical operator may also apply to the Refuge Manager for a permit or amended permit to provide similar types of visitor services. Granting the request will not result in an increase in the scope or level of service in excess of those provided as of January 1, 1979, by the requesting historical operator. The Refuge Manager shall grant the request if such visitor services are determined by the Refuge Manager to be:</P>
              <P>(i) Consistent with the management of refuge resources and the purposes for which the refuge area was established;</P>
              <P>(ii) Similar to the visitor services provided by the historical operator prior to January 1, 1979; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.</P>
              <P>(3) When a historical operator permit has expired, and if the visitor services permitted by it were adequately provided and consistent with the purposes of the refuge as determined by the Refuge Manager, the Refuge Manager shall renew the permit for a fixed term consistent with such new terms and conditions as are in the public interest. Should a historical operator decline to accept an offer of renewal, its rights as a historical operator shall be considered as terminated.</P>

              <P>(4) If the Refuge Manager determines that permitted visitor services must be curtailed or reduced in scope or season to protect refuge resources, or for other purposes, the Refuge Manager shall require the historical operator to make such changes in visitor services. If more than one historical operator providing the same type of visitor services is required to have those services curtailed, the Refuge Manager shall establish a proportionate reduction of <PRTPAGE P="531"/>visitor services among all such historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and other appropriate factors, so as to achieve a fair curtailment of visitor services among the historical operators. If the level of visitor services must be so curtailed that only one historical operator feasibly may continue to provide the visitor services, the Refuge Manager shall select one historical operator to continue to provide the curtailed visitor services through a competitive selection process.</P>
              <P>(5) The rights of a historical operator shall terminate if the historical operator fails to provide the visitor services under the terms and conditions of a permit issued by the Refuge Manager or fails to provide the visitor services for a period of more than twenty four (24) consecutive months.</P>
              <P>(6) The rights of a historical operator under this section shall terminate upon a change, after January 1, 1979, in the controlling interest of the historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(7) The Refuge Manager may authorize other persons to provide visitor services in a refuge in addition to historical operators, as long as such other persons conduct the services in a manner compatible with the purposes of the refuge.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Visitor services initially authorized after January 1, 1979, “preferred operators”.</E> (1) In selecting persons to provide, and in permitting any type of visitor service, excepting guided hunting or fishing, the Refuge Manager will give a preference to preferred operators determined qualified to provide such visitor services. Preferences for most directly affected Native Corporation(s) and local residents are equal and are not additive.</P>
              <P>(2) In selecting persons to provide any type of visitor service for refuges subject to a preferred operator preference under this section, the Refuge Manager will publicly solicit competitive offers for persons to apply for a permit, or the renewal of a permit, to provide such visitor service pursuant to Service procedures. Preferred operators must submit a responsive offer to such solicitation in order to effect their preference. If, as a result of the solicitation, an offer from a person other than a preferred operator is determined to be the best offer and that offeror is determined to be capable of carrying out the terms of the permit, the preferred operator which submitted the most responsive offer shall be given an opportunity to substantially equal the best offer received by amending its offer. If the amended offer of the preferred operator is considered by the Refuge Manager as being substantially equal to the terms of the best offer, the preferred operator, if determined to be capable of carrying out the terms of the permit, shall be awarded the visitor service permit. If the preferred operator fails to meet these requirements, the Refuge Manager shall award the permit to the person who submitted the best offer in response to the solicitation. The Native Corporation(s) determined to be “most directly affected” under this section and local residents have equal preference.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Refuge Manager from authorizing persons other than preferred operators to provide visitor services in refuge areas so long as the procedures described in this section have been followed with respect to preferred operators. Preferred operators are not entitled by this section to provide all visitor services in a qualified refuge.</P>
              <P>(4) An offer from a Native Corporation or a local corporation under this section must document its controlling interest in the entity or in the case of a joint venture, all partners, making the offer.</P>
              <P>(5) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or devised, directly or indirectly.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Preference to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated (CIRI).</E> (1) Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, in cooperation with village corporations within Cook Inlet Region when appropriate, shall have a right of first refusal to provide new visitor services within that portion of the Kenai National Moose Range (Kenai National Wildlife Refuge) within the boundaries of Cook Inlet Region. The CIRI shall have ninety (90) days from receipt of a prospectus in which to exercise its right.<PRTPAGE P="532"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) In order to exercise this right of first refusal, CIRI must submit an offer responsive to the terms of a visitor services solicitation. If CIRI makes such an offer and is determined by the Refuge Manager to be capable of carrying out the terms of the special use permit, it shall be awarded the permit. If it does not, the permit may be awarded to another person pursuant to a showing that such other person can carry out the conditions of the special use permit in a manner compatible with the purposes of the refuge. An offer being made by CIRI under this section must document controlling interest by CIRI when made in cooperation with village corporations within the Cook Inlet Region. The CIRI right of first refusal shall have precedence over the rights of preferred operators.</P>
              <P>(3) The right of first refusal described in this section may not be sold, transferred, devised, or assigned, directly or indirectly.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Most directly affected Native Corporation determination.</E> (1) Prior to the issuance of a solicitation document for any new visitor service in a refuge, the Refuge Manager shall provide an opportunity for any Native Corporation interested in providing visitor services within that refuge to submit an application to the Refuge Manager to be determined “most directly affected” Native Corporation. The application shall include but not be limited to, the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the Native Corporation, the date of incorporation, its articles of incorporation and structure, and the name of the applicable refuge area;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location of the corporation's population center or centers;</P>
              <P>(iii) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use, and their effects on the Native Corporation as a result of the expansion or establishment of the refuge; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Any other information the Native Corporation believes is relevant.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native Corporations, the Refuge Manager will determine the “most directly affected” Native Corporation based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of acres of surface land within and adjoining the refuge that the Native Corporation owns, or which has been selected under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, unless such selection is determined to be invalid or is relinquished;</P>
              <P>(ii) The distance and accessibility from the Native Corporation's population center and/or business address to the applicable refuge; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The socio-economic impacts, including historic and traditional use, and their effects as a result of the expansion or establishment of the refuge.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event that more than one Native Corporation is determined to be equally affected, each such Native Corporation shall be considered as a preferred operator under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The Refuge Manager's “most directly affected” Native Corporation determination or when requested, the Regional Director's appeal decision for a refuge is applicable for all new visitor services in that refuge.</P>
              <P>(5) Any Native Corporation that has not applied for a most directly affected Native Corporation determination may apply for a determination upon issuance of a future solicitation for a new visitor service. A corporation determined to be most directly affected for a refuge will maintain that status for all future visitor service solicitations.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Appeal procedures.</E> Any person(s) who believe that they have been improperly denied rights with respect to providing visitor services under this section may appeal the denial to the Regional Director. Such an appeal must be submitted in writing within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the denial from which an appeal is sought. The appeals process as defined in 50 CFR subpart F, 36.41(b) will apply with exception of the period of time allowed to file an appeal.</P>

              <P>(2) For noncompetitively issued permits, the applicant may present the application verbally if he/she is unable to prepare a written application. The refuge manager will keep a written record of such verbal application. For competitively issued permits, the applicant must submit a written application in the format delineated in the prospectus or other designated format of the Service.</P>
              <P>(3) The refuge manager will grant or deny applications for noncompetitively issued permits in writing within 45 days, except for good cause. For competitively issued permits, the refuge manager will grant or deny applications in accordance with the time frame established in the prospectus, except for good cause.</P>
              <P>(4) Refuge managers may establish application period deadlines for individual refuges for both competitively and noncompetitively issued permits. The refuge manager will send notification of availability for commercial opportunities and application deadlines to existing and/or the previous year's permittees. He/she will publish the notice in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the State and in at least one local newspaper if available, and will make available for broadcast on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local prospective applicants.</P>
              <P>(5) The Service may limit the number of applications that an individual may submit for competitively awarded offerings.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Competitively awarded permits.</E> (1) Where the number of available permits is limited, refuge managers will award permits competitively. A prospectus with invitation to bid system will be the primary competitive method used for selecting commercial visitor services. Where justified, other selection methods, including but not limited to lotteries, may be used. Such circumstances may include, but not be limited to, the timely refilling of use areas that have become vacant during regularly scheduled terms to prevent commercial visitor service opportunities from going unused, and initiating trial programs on individual refuges. The refuge manager has discretionary authority to issue noncompetitive permits on a one-time, short-term basis to accredited educational institutions and other nonprofit organizations to conduct primarily environmental education-related activities that also may be recreational in nature in use areas where permits for that type of guided recreational activity are otherwise limited to competitive award.</P>
              <P>(2) Where numbers of permits have been limited for an activity prior to the promulgation of these regulations and a prospectus with invitation to bid system has not yet been developed, refuge managers may issue noncompetitive five-year permits consistent with the terms set forth in paragraph (e)(16) of this section on a one-time basis to existing permittees.</P>

              <P>(3) The Service will publish notice of all solicitations for competition in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this <PRTPAGE P="544"/>section and include reasonable application periods of not less than 60 days. When competitively selecting permittees for an activity in a use area where permits for that activity were not previously competitively awarded, the Service will publish notice of the upcoming opportunity a minimum of 18 months prior to the effective date of the permit term.</P>
              <P>(4) All prospectuses will identify the selection criteria that the Service will use to evaluate the proposals. All prospectuses involving commercial visitor services must include experience and performance in providing the same or similar services as a criterion. In evaluating the experience of an applicant, the Service will specifically consider knowledge of the specific area covered by the prospectus and the nature of the technical skills required to provide quality service to the public.</P>
              <P>(5) A panel of Service employees who use a scoring process based on the selection criteria will evaluate and rank applications received in response to a prospectus.</P>
              <P>(6) The Service has discretionary authority to not evaluate or consider proposals that are incomplete or improperly submitted.</P>
              <P>(7) The Service may establish minimum scores to qualify for the award of permits. If established, these minimum scores will be identified in the prospectus.</P>
              <P>(8) The Service may establish limits on the number of use areas within an individual refuge, or on refuges statewide, in which a permittee is authorized to operate. This limit applies to different corporations in which the same individual has any ownership interests.</P>
              <P>(9) When vacancies occur in competitively filled use areas, the procedure for reissuing the permits will depend on how long it has been since the permit originally was issued. The Service will award the permit to the next highest ranking interested applicant in the original solicitation, if a vacancy occurs within the first 12 months of the permit's effective date. Resolicited competition for the area will occur as soon as practicable if:</P>
              <P>(i) A vacancy occurs after 12 months of the permit's effective date; and</P>
              <P>(ii) At least 24 months of the original permit term is available for a new permittee after completion of the solicitation, application, evaluation and awards period. If less than 24 months of the term of the permit is available, the Service has the discretion to solicit competition during the regularly scheduled solicitation period. The Service may annually issue noncompetitive permits for vacant areas, where there has not been significant permittee interest, until competition can be solicited in conjunction with other solicitations for vacant areas.</P>
              <P>(10) Terms of permits awarded under the prospectus with invitation method are valid for 5 years except in those instances where the Service issues permits to fill vacancies occurring during a scheduled award cycle. In these instances, the permit duration is limited to the expiration date of the original award period. Permits awarded under the prospectus by invitation method must be renewed noncompetitively by the refuge manager for a period of 5 additional years upon application and a showing of permittee compliance with all applicable permit terms and conditions and a satisfactory record of performance. After one renewal, the Service shall not extend or noncompetitively renew another permit.</P>
              <P>(11) Permit privileges may be transferred to other qualified entities that demonstrate the ability to meet Service standards, as outlined in the prospectus upon which the existing permit was based, subject to approval by the refuge manager. Requests for transfers must be made in writing to the refuge manager. A permittee who transfers his/her privileges will not be eligible to be considered for competitively awarded permits for the same type of activity on the same national wildlife refuge for a period of three years following the authorized transfer. The Service retains complete discretion in allowing transfers. In general, the Service approves transfers only upon demonstrating that it is to the government's benefit and if all the following criteria are satisfied:</P>

              <P>(i) The transfer is part of the sale or disposition of the current permittee's entire business as earlier defined;<PRTPAGE P="545"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The current permittee was either conducting the commercial operation in the refuge under authorization of a permit for a minimum of 12 years or owns significant real property in the area, the value of which is dependent on holding a refuge permit. Consideration of the last element will include, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) The relationship of the real property to permitted refuge activities as documented in the operations plan;</P>
              <P>(B) The percentage that the authorized refuge activities comprise of the total commercial use associated with the real property; and</P>
              <P>(C) The appraised value of the real property.</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee must be independently qualified to hold the permit under the standards of the prospectus of the original existing permit.</P>
              <P>(iv) The transferee has an acceptable history of compliance with State and Federal fish and wildlife and related permit regulations during the past 5 years. An individual with any felony conviction is an ineligible transferee. Transfer approval to an individual having any violations, convictions, or pleas of nolo contendere for fish and wildlife related federal misdemeanors or State violations will be discretionary. Denial is based on, but not limited to, whether the individual committed any violation in which the case disposition resulted in any of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Any jail time served or probation;</P>
              <P>(B) Any criminal fine of $250 or greater;</P>
              <P>(C) Forfeiture of equipment or harvested animal (or parts thereof) valued at $250 or greater;</P>
              <P>(D) Suspension of privileges or revocation of any fish and wildlife related license/permits;</P>
              <P>(E) Other alternative sentencing that indicates the penalty is of equal severity to the foregoing elements; or</P>
              <P>(F) Any multiple convictions or pleas of nolo contendere for fish and wildlife-related Federal misdemeanors or State fish and wildlife-related violations or misdemeanors irrespective of the amount of the fine.</P>
              <P>(12) The transferee must follow the operations plan of the original permittee. The transferee may modify the operations plan with the written consent of the refuge manager as long as the change does not result in increased adverse impacts to refuge resources or other refuge users.</P>
              <P>(13) Upon timely approval of the transfer, the Service will issue the new permittee a permit for the remaining portion of the original permit term. The refuge manager retains the right to restrict, suspend, revoke, or not renew the permit for failure to comply with its terms and conditions.</P>
              <P>(14) Permit privileges issued under this paragraph (e) may be transferred, subject to refuge manager approval, to a former spouse when a court awards permit-associated business assets in a divorce settlement agreement to that person. The recipient must independently qualify to hold the originally issued permit under the minimum standards identified by the Service, and the permittee must have an acceptable history of compliance as set forth in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(15) Permit privileges issued under this paragraph (e) may be transferred in the case of death or disability of the permittee, subject to refuge manager approval, as provided in this paragraph (e). In these cases, the permit privileges may pass to a spouse who can demonstrate he/she is capable of providing the authorized services and who has an acceptable history of compliance as set forth in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section. A spouse who lacks any required license(s) but otherwise qualifies may hire an employee, who holds the required license(s) and who has an acceptable history of compliance as set forth in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section, to assist in the operation. Permit privileges may also pass to another member of the immediate family or a person who was a business partner at the time of original permit issuance. This person must be independently qualified under the minimum standards identified by the Service at the time of original permit issuance and have an acceptable history of compliance as set forth in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section.</P>

              <P>(16) Upon September 26, 1997, refuge managers will amend existing competitively-awarded permits through the <PRTPAGE P="546"/>prospectus method to make the terms fully consistent with this section, including eligibility for a 5-year non-competitive renewal.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Fees.</E> Permittees must pay fees formally established by regional and/or nation-wide Service policy. The refuge manager must document any fee exemption.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Subletting and subcontracting.</E> A permittee may not sublet any part of an authorized use area. Subcontracting any service authorized by the permit requires written approval from the refuge manager unless the subcontracted service is specifically identified in the permittee's approved perations plan.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Restriction, suspension and revocation of permits.</E> The refuge manager may suspend, revoke, or reasonably restrict the terms of a permit for noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the regulations in this subchapter C; for nonuse of the permit; for violations/convictions (including pleas of nolo contendere) of any law or regulation pertaining to the same type of activity authorized by the permit, whether or not the activity occurred on or off the refuge; to protect public health or safety; or if the refuge manager determines the use to be incompatible with refuge purposes or is inconsistent with the Service's obligations under Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. All actions pertaining to this paragraph are subject to the appeal process as set forth in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> (1) Any person adversely affected by a refuge manager's decision or order relating to the person's permit, or application for a permit, has the right to have the decision or order reviewed by the regional director. This section does not apply to permits or applications for rights-of-way. See 50 CFR 29.22 for the hearing and appeals procedure on rights-of-way.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to making any adverse decision or order on any permit or an application for a noncompetitively issued permit, the refuge manager will notify the permittee or applicant, verbally or in writing, of the proposed action and its effective date. A permittee or applicant of noncompetitively issued permits, shall have 45 calendar days after notification in which to present to the refuge manager, orally or in writing, a statement in opposition to the proposed action or effective date. Notification in writing to a valid permit holder shall occur within 10 calendar days after receipt of the statement in opposition to the refuge manager's final decision or order. An applicant for a noncompetitively issued permit shall be notified in writing within 30 calendar days after receipt of the statement in opposition, of the refuge manager's final decision or order. An applicant for a competitively issued permit who is not selected will not receive advance notice of the award decision. Such applicants, who wish to appeal the decision must appeal directly to the regional director within the time period provided for in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The permittee or applicant shall have 45 calendar days from the postmarked date of the refuge manager's final decision or order in which to file a written appeal to the regional director. In appeals involving applicants who were not selected during a competitive selection process, the selected applicant concurrently will have the opportunity to provide information to the regional director prior to the final decision. Selected applicants who choose to take advantage of this opportunity, will retain their right of appeal should the appeal of the unsuccessful applicant result in reversal or revision of the original decision. For purposes of reconsideration, appellants shall present the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Any statement or documentation, in addition to that included in the initial application, permit or competitive prospectus, which demonstrates that the appellant satisfies the criteria set forth in the document under which the permit application/award was made;</P>
              <P>(ii) The basis for the permit applicant's disagreement with the decision or order being appealed; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether or not the permit applicant requests an informal hearing before the regional director.</P>

              <P>(4) The regional director will provide a hearing if requested by the applicant. After consideration of the written materials and oral hearing, and within a reasonable time, the regional director <PRTPAGE P="547"/>shall affirm, reverse, or modify the refuge manager's decision or order and shall set forth in writing the basis for the decision. The applicant must be sent a copy of the decision promptly. The decision will constitute final agency action.</P>
              <P>(5) Permittee compliance with any decision or order of a refuge manager shall be required during the appeal process unless the regional director makes a preliminary finding contrary to the refuge manager's decision, and prepares a written determination that such action is not detrimental to the interests of the United States, or upon submission and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate by the refuge manager to indemnify the United States from loss or damage.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">State selection of guide-outfitters.</E> Nothing in this section will prohibit the Service from cooperating with the State of Alaska in administering the selection of sport fishing guides and big game hunting guide-outfitters operating on national wildlife refuges should the State develop a competitive selection process which is acceptable to the Service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>These regulations implement the requirement of section 1002(d) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 94 Stat. 2450, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3142(d), that the Secretary establish guidelines governing surface geological and geophysical exploration for oil and gas within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Section 1002 mandates an oil and gas exploration program for the refuge's coastal plain. The program shall culminate in a report to Congress which contains, among other things, the identification of those areas within the coastal plain that have oil and gas production potential, an estimate of the volume of oil and gas concerned, the description of the wildlife, its habitat, and other resources that are within the areas identified, and an evaluation of the adverse effects that the carrying out of further exploration for, and the development and production of, oil and gas within such areas will have on the refuge's resources. It is the objective of this program to ascertain the best possible data and information concerning the probable existence, location, volume, and potential for further exploration, development, and production of oil and gas within the coastal plain without significantly adversely affecting the wildlife, its habitat, or the environment and without unnecessary duplication of exploratory activities. These regulations prescribe the requirements and procedures for obtaining authorization for and the conduct of such exploratory activities, and for submitting to the Department the resulting data and information. These regulations also describe other matters relating to the administration of the program.</P>

              <P>(a) Before the issuance of its special use permit, any applicant whose exploration plan has been approved under § 37.22 shall furnish to the Service a surety bond of not less than $100,000, or other security satisfactory to the Service, to secure performance of its exploration plan and plan(s) of operation and compliance with the permit and this part. Such surety bond shall be issued by qualified surety companies approved by the Department of the Treasury (see Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570). Such bond shall be maintained by the permittee for the benefit of the Service until the Regional Director notifies the permittee in writing that all terms and conditions of its exploration plan, special use permit, plan of operation, and this part have been met or otherwise consents to its cancellation or termination. Any bond furnished or maintained by a person under this section shall be on a form approved or prescribed by the Regional Director. The Regional Director may require an increase in the amount of any bond or other security to be furnished and any outstanding bond or security or require a new bond or security whenever additional coverage is needed to secure performance of its exploration plan and plan(s) of operation and compliance with the permit and this part or is needed as a consequence of default.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever a permittee's exploration plan, plan of operation, or special use permit is revised or modified, the permittee shall provide to the Regional Director within 30 days thereafter an acknowledgement by the surety that its bond continues to apply to the exploration plan, plan of operation or special use permit, as revised or modified, unless a waiver of notice to the surety is contained in the bond or the surety is not otherwise released by the revision or modification, or unless the permittee provides to the Service an increased or additional bond.</P>
              <P>(c) Recovery of the amount specified in the permittee's bond or other security shall not preclude the Department from seeking specific performance by the permittee of any obligations not satisfied by enforcement of the bond or security, or compensation for any damages, losses or costs due to the permittee's activities which exceed the amount recovered, by pursuing the Department's legal remedies.</P>

Written notice of the Director's decision and the reasons therefor shall be provided promptly to the applicant. The Director's decision shall constitute the final administrative decision of the Secretary in the matter. Nothing in this part shall be construed to deprive the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks of the authority to take jurisdiction at any stage of any appeal or request for reconsideration and render the final decision in the matter after holding any informal hearing that may be required, to review any decision of the Regional Director or Director, or to direct the Regional Director or Director to reconsider a decision.</FP>
              <P>(d) The Regional Director, as a condition of approval of any exploration plan under this section, shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Require that all data and information (including processed, analyzed and interpreted information) obtained as a result of carrying out the plan shall be submitted to the Regional Director, as provided in § 37.53;</P>
              <P>(2) Make such data and information available to the public, except that any processed, analyzed and interpreted data or information shall be held confidential by the Department for a period of not less than 10 years following the submission of such data or information to the Regional Director or 2 years following any lease sale including the area within the refuge from which the information was obtained, whichever period is longer, as provided in § 37.54; and</P>
              <P>(3) Require that all raw data and information obtained as a result of carrying out the plan shall be made available by the permittee to any person at fair cost.</P>
              <P>(e) In the course of evaluating an exploration plan, the Regional Director shall also evaluate the effect of the proposed exploratory activities on subsistence uses and needs, the availability for exploration of alternate areas within the coastal plain, and alternatives to the proposed activities which would reduce or eliminate the use of areas within the coastal plain needed for subsistence purposes.

              <P>(b) Each applicant shall submit with each exploration plan submitted a payment, the amount of which shall be an estimate made by the Regional Director of the costs which will be incurred by the Department in publishing, reviewing, modifying and approving or disapproving the applicant's exploration plan.</P>
              <P>(1) If the applicant's plan is disapproved or if the applicant withdraws its application before a decision is reached on its plan, the applicant shall be responsible for such costs incurred by the Department in processing the applicant's application up to the date on which the plan is disapproved or the Regional Director receives written notice of the applicant's withdrawal, and for costs subsequently incurred by the Department in terminating the application review process. If the costs actually incurred exceed the estimate paid at the time of application, reimbursement by the applicant of such additional costs shall be due within 30 days of receiving notice from the Regional Director of the additional amount due. If the actual costs incurred are less than the estimate paid by the applicant, the excess shall be refunded to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) If the applicant's plan is approved, the applicant shall pay an estimate made by the Regional Director of the costs which will be incurred by the Department in preparing and issuing to the applicant a special use permit. The first quarterly payment made by the applicant pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be adjusted upward or downward, as warranted, to accurately reflect the actual costs incurred by the Department in processing the permit. If an applicant withdraws after its plan is approved, but before its special use permit is issued, the applicant shall be responsible for such costs incurred by the Department in preparing the applicant's permit up to the date on which the Regional Director receives written notice of the applicant's withdrawal and for costs subsequently incurred by the Department in terminating permit preparation and issuance.</P>

              <P>(3) When two or more applications are filed which the Regional Director determines to be in competition with each other, each applicant shall reimburse the Department for such actual costs incurred in processing its exploration plan and special use permit, if issued, except that those costs which <PRTPAGE P="563"/>are not readily identifiable with one of the applicants, shall be paid by each of the applicants in equal shares.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon issuance of a special use permit, the permittee shall make an initial advance payment covering that current fiscal year quarter and quarterly payments thereafter to cover the actual costs incurred by the Department in administering the permittee's permit for its duration. Such costs shall include, but are not limited to, those direct costs and indirect costs, as established by the indirect costs rate of the charging bureau or office, incurred in reviewing and acting on permittee's plan(s) of operation; reviewing evidence of the permittee's compliance with any order given by the Regional Director under § 37.13; preparing and issuing the permittee's special use permit; inspecting, monitoring, and enforcing the permittee's compliance with its approved exploration plan, plan(s) of operation, special use permit and this part; performing the permittee's obligations pursuant to § 37.31(a); and identifying, evaluating and preserving historic, archeological and cultural resources in areas to be explored by the permittee. Each quarterly payment will be paid at the outset of the quarter and will cover the estimated cost of that quarter as adjusted by the Regional Director by reason of any adjustment warranted by paragraph (b) of this section or by overpayments or underpayments in previous quarters for which adjustment has not already been made. Upon termination of the permittee's special use permit, reimbursement or refundment of any outstanding amounts due the Department or the permittee shall be made within 180 days.</P>
              <P>(d) Estimates required by this section shall be made by the Regional Director on the basis of the best available cost information. However, reimbursement shall not be limited to the Regional Director's estimate if actual costs exceed projected estimates.</P>
              <P>(e) All payments required by this section shall be made payable to the Service. No applicant or permittee shall set off or otherwise deduct any debt due to or any sum claimed to be owed to it by the United States from any payment required by this section. Overpayments shall be credited or refunded to the person making them.</P>
              <P>(f) When through partnership, joint venture or other business arrangement more than one person applies for or participates in a special use permit, each shall be jointly and severally liable for reimbursing the Department's cost under this section.</P>
              <P>(g) Any lodging, food, communication, and transportation provided by a permittee under § 37.42 shall be deemed to be costs paid to the Department in kind for services rendered in inspecting and monitoring the permittee's exploratory activities. At the end of each quarter, the permittee shall furnish the Regional Director with a report, in a format approved or prescribed by him, on the goods and services provided during that quarter, and the names of the individuals to whom they were provided.</P>
              <P>(h) Any dispute between an applicant or permittee and the Regional Director as to costs actually incurred by the Department and charged to the applicant or permittee shall be finally decided for the Secretary by the Director, using the procedures described in § 37.22(c).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Civil penalties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section prescribes the procedures for assessing a civil penalty for the violation of any provision of an approved exploration plan, any term or condition of the special use permit issued under § 37.23, or any prohibition contained in this part. The civil penalty remedy afforded by this section is in addition to all other remedies available to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of violation.</E> (1) The notice of violation shall be issued by the Solicitor and served personally or by registered mail upon the person named in the notice (hereinafter the respondent) or his authorized representative. The notice shall contain:</P>
              <P>(i) A summary of the facts believed to show a violation by the respondent;</P>
              <P>(ii) A specific reference to the provision, term, condition or prohibition allegedly violated; and</P>

              <P>(iii) The amount of the penalty proposed to be assessed. The notice may also contain an initial proposal for <PRTPAGE P="564"/>compromise or settlement of the action.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice of violation shall also advise respondent of his right to:</P>
              <P>(i) Respond to the notice within 45 calendar days from the date of its issuance by: (A) Undertaking informal discussions with the Solicitor; (B) Accepting the proposed penalty or the compromise, if any, offered in the notice; or (C) Filing a petition for relief in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Take no action and await the Solicitor's notice of assessment. Such response must be received by the Solicitor on or before the 45th day during normal business hours at the address stated in the notice.</P>
              <P>(3) Any notice of violation may be amended, but any nontechnical amendment will extend the running of the respondent's 45 day period for response from the date of the notice to the date of the amendment.</P>
              <P>(4) Acceptance of the proposed penalty or the compromise, if any, stated in the notice of violation shall be deemed to be a waiver of the notice of assessment required in paragraph (d) of this section and of the respondent's right to an opportunity for a hearing described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Petition for relief.</E> If the respondent chooses, he may ask that no penalty be assessed or that the amount be reduced and he may admit or contest the legal sufficiency of the Solicitor's charges and allegations of facts, by filing a petition for relief at the address specified in the notice within 45 calendar days from the date thereof. Such petition must be received by the Solicitor on or before the 45th day during normal business hours. The petition shall be in writing and signed by the respondent. If the respondent is a corporation, partnership, association or agency, the petition must be signed by an officer or official authorized to sign such document. It must set forth in full the legal or other reasons for the relief requested.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of assessment.</E> (1) After 45 calendar days from the date of the notice of violation or any amendment thereof, the Solicitor may proceed to determine whether the respondent committed the violation alleged and to determine the amount of civil penalty to be assessed, taking into consideration the information available and such showing as may have been made by the respondent. The Solicitor shall notify the respondent of his determinations by a written notice of assessment, which shall also set forth the basis for his determinations. The notice of assessment shall be served on the respondent personally or by registered mail.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice of assessment shall also advise the respondent of his right to request a hearing on the matter in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for a hearing.</E> Within 45 calendar days from the date of the issuance of the notice of assessment, the respondent may request a hearing to be conducted on the matter in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 through 557 by filing a dated, written request for hearing with the Hearings Division, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the Interior, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Such request must be received at this address on or before the 45th day during normal business hours. The respondent shall state the respondent's preference as to the place and date for a hearing. The request must enclose a copy of the notice of violation and the notice of assessment. A copy of the request shall be served upon the Solicitor personally or by mail at the address specified in the notice of assessment.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Finality of decision.</E> If no request for a hearing is filed in accordance with this section, the assessment stated in the notice of assessment shall be effective and constitute the final administrative decision of the Secretary on the 45th calandar day from the date of the notice of assessment. If the request for hearing is timely filed in accordance with this section, the date of the final administrative decision in the matter shall be as provided in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section. When a civil penalty assessed under this section becomes final, the respondent shall have 20 calendar days from the date of the final administrative decision within which to make full payment of the penalty assessed. Payment <PRTPAGE P="565"/>will be timely only if received in the Office of the Solicitor during normal business hours on or before the 20th day.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the Hearings Division will assign an administrative law judge who shall have all the powers accorded by law and necessary to preside over the parties and the hearing and to make decisions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 through 557. Notice of such assignment shall be given promptly to the respondent and to the Solicitor at the address stated in the notice of assessment. Upon notice of the assignment of an administrative law judge to the case, the Solicitor shall file all correspondence and petitions exchanged between the Solicitor and the respondent which shall become a part of the hearing record.</P>
              <P>(2) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 through 557 and with 43 CFR part 4 to the extent that it is not inconsistent with this part. Subject to 43 CFR 1.3, the respondent may appear in person, by representative, or by counsel. The hearing shall be held in a location established by the administrative law judge, giving due regard to the convenience of the parties, their representatives and witnesses. Failure to appear at the time set for hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and consent to the decision on the record made at the hearing. The judge shall render a written decision on the record, which shall set forth his findings of facts and conclusions of law and the reasons therefore, and an assessment of a civil penalty if he determines that the respondent committed the violation charged.</P>
              <P>(3) Discovery shall be obtained by employing the procedures described 43 CFR 4.1130 through 4.1141. In addition, discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under 43 CFR 4.1132(a) and acquired and developed in anticipation of administrative adjudication or litigation, may be obtained only as follows:</P>
              <P>(i)(A) A party through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.</P>
              <P>(B) Upon motion, the administrative law judge may order further discovery by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope and such provisions under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section concerning fees and expenses, as the administrative law judge may deem appropriate.</P>
              <P>(ii) A party may discover facts known or opinions held by an expert, who has been retained or employed by another party in anticipation of administrative adjudication or litigation or preparation therefore and who is not expected to be called as a witness, only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unless manifest injustice would result, (A) the administrative law judge shall require the party seeking discovery to pay the expert, or the Department if the expert is an employee of the United States, a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section; and (B) with respect to discovery under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of this section the administrative law judge may require and with respect to discovery under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section the administrative law judge shall require, the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless the notice of appeal is filed in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, the administrative law judge's decision shall constitute the final administrative decision of the Secretary in the matter and shall become effective 30 calendar days from the date of the decision.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> (1) Either the respondent or the Solicitor may seek an appeal from the decision of an administrative law judge as to the respondent's violation or penalty or both by the filing of a notice of appeal with the Director, <PRTPAGE P="566"/>Office of Hearings and Appeals, United States Department of the Interior, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, Virginia 22203, within 30 calendar days of the date of the administrative law judge's decision. Such notice shall be accompanied by proof of service on the administrative law judge and the opposing party.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of such a request, the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, shall appoint an ad hoc appeals board to determine whether an appeal should be granted, and to hear and decide an appeal. To the extent they are not inconsistent herewith, the provisions of 43 CFR part 4, subpart G shall apply to appeal proceedings under this paragraph. The determination of the board to grant or deny an appeal, as well as its decision on the merits of an appeal, shall be in writing and become effective as the final administrative determination of the Secretary in the matter on the date it is rendered, unless otherwise specified therein.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Amount of penalty.</E> The amount of any civil penalty assessed under this section shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall, however, constitute a separate offense. In determining the amount of such penalty, the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation committed, and, with respect to the respondent, his history of any prior offenses, his demonstrated good faith in attempting to achieve timely compliance after being cited for the violation, and such other matters as justice may require shall be considered.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Petition for remission.</E> The Solicitor may modify or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this paragraph unless the matter is pending in court for judicial review or for recovery of the civil penalty assessed. A petition for remission may be filed by the respondent with the Solicitor at any time from the date of the notice of violation referred to in paragraph (b) of this section until 90 days after the date of final administrative decision assessing a civil penalty. The petition must set forth in full the legal and other reasons for the relief requested. Any petition that is not timely filed will not receive consideration. The Solicitor's decision shall be the final administrative decision for the Secretary on the petition.</P>

The lessor must be able to regain possession of the lessee's interest (<E T="03">leasehold interest</E>) at the end of the lease term. An agreement that does not correspond to this definition is not a lease even if it is labeled as one.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Personal property</E> means anything tangible or intangible that is not real property.</P>
              <P>(1) Tangible personal property includes:</P>
              <P>(i) Objects, such as equipment and supplies, that are moveable without substantive damage to the land or any structure to which they may be attached;</P>

              <P>(C) Do not transfer a right of exclusive use and possession of an area of land or water.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Project</E> means one or more related undertakings in a project-by-project grant that are necessary to fulfill a need or needs, as defined by a State fish and wildlife agency, consistent with the purposes of the appropriate Act. For convenience of reference in this part, the meaning of project includes an agency's fish and wildlife program under a comprehensive management system grant.</P>

Examples of real property include fee, conservation easements, access easements, utility easements, and mineral rights. A leasehold interest is also real property except in those States where the State Attorney General provides an official opinion that determines a lease is personal property under State law.</P>
              <P>(1) A parcel includes (unless limited by its legal description) the space above and below it and anything physically affixed to it by a natural process or human action. Examples include standing timber, other vegetation (except annual crops), buildings, roads, fences, and other structures.</P>
              <P>(2) A parcel may also have rights attached to it by a legally prescribed procedure. Examples include water rights or an access easement that allows the parcel's owner to travel across an adjacent parcel.</P>
              <P>(3) The legal classification of an interest, benefit, or right depends on its attributes rather than the name assigned to it. For example, a grazing permit is often incorrectly labeled a lease, which can be real property, but most grazing permits are actually licenses, which are not real property.</P>

              <P>The State must complete the actions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to resolve a declaration of diversion. The State must use a source of funds other than license revenue to fund the replacement of license revenue.</P>

              <P>(d) The agency must take one of the following actions to resolve a diversion of real, personal, or intellectual property:</P>
              <P>(1) Regain management control of the property, which must be in about the same condition as before diversion;</P>

              <P>(a) A State fish and wildlife agency certifies the number of paid license holders by responding to the Director's annual request for the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of people who have paid licenses to hunt in the State during the State-specified certification period (certification period); and</P>
              <P>(2) The number of people who have paid licenses to fish in the State during the certification period.</P>

              <P>(c) If an agency director uses statistical sampling to eliminate multiple counting of the same individuals, he or she must ensure that the sampling is complete by the earlier of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Five years after the last statistical sample; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>What additional requirements apply to certifying multiyear licenses?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following additional requirements apply to certifying multiyear licenses:</P>
              <P>(a) A State fish and wildlife agency must follow the requirement at § 80.34(a) for all multiyear licenses sold before and after the date that the agency adopts the new standard, unless following the exception at paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) If an agency is using an investment, annuity, or similar method to fulfill the net-revenue requirements of the version of § 80.33 that was effective from August 31, 2011, or any prior rule that required net revenue, until September 26, 2019, the agency must discontinue that method and convert to the new standard, unless following the exception at paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) If the revenue collected at the time of sale has not been spent, the agency must begin to use the new standard by applying the total amount the agency received at the time of sale.</P>
              <P>(2) If the revenue collected at the time of sale has been spent, the agency must apply the new standard as if it were applicable at the time of sale. For example, if a single-privilege, multiyear license sold for $100 in 2014, and the agency adopts the new standard in 2018, then 4 years have been used toward the amount received by the agency (4 years × $2 = $8) and the license holder may be counted for up to 46 more years ($100 − $8 = $92/$2 = 46).</P>
              <P>(c) An agency may continue to follow the requirements of the version of § 80.33 that was effective from August 31, 2011, or any prior rule that required net revenue, until September 26, 2019, for those multiyear licenses that were sold before the date specified at § 80.34(b) if the agency:</P>
              <P>(1) Notifies the Director of the agency's intention to do so;</P>
              <P>(2) Describes how the new requirement will cause financial or operational harm to the agency when applied to licenses sold before the effective date of these regulations; and</P>
              <P>(3) Commits to follow the current standard for those multiyear licenses sold after the date specified at § 80.34(b).</P>
              <P>(d) A multiyear license may be valid for either a specific or indeterminate number of years, but it must be valid for at least 2 years.</P>

              <P>(e) The agency may count the license for all certification periods for which it received the minimum required revenue, as long as the license holder meets all other requirements of this <PRTPAGE P="586"/>subpart. For example, an agency may count a single-privilege, multiyear license that sells for $25 for 12 certification periods.

              <P>(f) An agency may spend a multiyear license fee as soon as the agency receives it.</P>

              <P>(h) The agency must use and document a reasonable technique for deciding how many multiyear-license holders remain alive in the certification period. Some examples of reasonable techniques are specific identification of license holders, statistical sampling, life-expectancy tables, and mortality tables. The agency may instead use 80 years of age as a default for life expectancy.</P>

              <P>(c) The agency must receive at least the average amount of State-provided discretionary funds that it received for the administration of the State's fish and wildlife agency during the State's 5 previous fiscal years.</P>
              <P>(1) State-provided discretionary funds are those from the State's general fund that the State may increase or decrease if it chooses to do so.</P>
              <P>(2) Some State-provided funds are from special taxes, trust funds, gifts, bequests, or other sources specifically dedicated to the support of the State fish and wildlife agency. These funds typically fluctuate annually due to interest rates, sales, or other factors. They are not discretionary funds for purposes of this part as long as the State does not take any action to reduce the amount available to its fish and wildlife agency.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency must receive and account for the State or other entity funds as license revenue.</P>
              <P>(e) The agency must issue licenses in the license holder's name or by using a unique identifier that is traceable to the license holder, who is verifiable in State records.</P>

              <P>(1) The Regional Director may require States in the Region to make changes needed to achieve the minimum 15-percent Regional average before the end of the fifth year; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Regional Director must not require a State to increase or decrease its allocation if the State has allocated at least 15 percent over the 5-year period.</P>
              <P>(f) A Federal obligation of these allocated funds must occur by the end of the fourth consecutive Federal fiscal year after the Federal fiscal year in which the funds first became available for allocation.</P>
              <P>(g) If the agency's application to use these funds has not led to a Federal obligation by that time, these allocated funds become available for reapportionment among the State fish and wildlife agencies for the following fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(a) When a State fish and wildlife agency allocates and obligates funds it must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The ratio of total funds obligated for marine fisheries projects to total funds obligated for marine and freshwater fisheries projects combined must equal the ratio of resident marine anglers to the total number of resident anglers in the State; and</P>
              <P>(2) The ratio of total funds obligated for freshwater fisheries projects to total funds obligated for marine and freshwater fisheries projects combined must equal the ratio of resident freshwater anglers to the total number of resident anglers in the State.</P>
              <P>(b) A resident angler is one who fishes for recreational purposes in the same State where he or she maintains legal residence.</P>
              <P>(c) Agencies must determine the relative distribution of resident anglers in the State between those that fish in marine environments and those that fish in freshwater environments. Agencies must use the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-associated Recreation or another statistically reliable survey or technique approved by the Regional Director for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(d) If an agency uses statistical sampling to determine the relative distribution of resident anglers in the State between those that fish in marine environments and those that fish in freshwater environments, the sampling must be complete by the earlier of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Five years after the last statistical sample; or</P>
              <P>(2) Before completing the first certification following any change in the licensing system that could affect the number of sportfishing license holders.</P>
              <P>(e) The amounts allocated from each year's apportionment do not necessarily have to result in an equitable allocation for each year. However, the amounts allocated over a variable period, not to exceed 3 years, must result in an equitable allocation between marine and freshwater fisheries projects.</P>
              <P>(f) Agencies that fail to allocate funds equitably between marine and freshwater fisheries projects may become ineligible to use Sport Fish Restoration program funds. These agencies must remain ineligible until they demonstrate to the Director that they have allocated the funds equitably.</P>

The Regional Director decides on the specific Federal share between 75 and 100 percent based on what he or she decides is fair, just, and equitable. The Regional Director may reduce the Federal share to less than 75 percent of allowable project costs only if the District of Columbia voluntarily provides match to pay the remaining allowable costs. However, the Regional Director must not reduce the Federal share below 10 percent unless he or she follows the procedure at paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The Regional Director may provide funds to pay 75 to 100 percent of the allowable costs of a project funded by a grant to a fish and wildlife agency of the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands and the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. The Regional Director decides on the specific Federal share between 75 and 100 percent based on what he or she decides is fair, just, and equitable. The Regional Director may reduce the Federal share to less than 75 percent of allowable project costs only if the Commonwealth or territorial fish and wildlife agency voluntarily provides match to pay the remaining allowable costs. However, the Regional Director must not reduce the Federal share below 10 percent unless he or she follows the procedure at paragraph (d) of this section. The Federal share of allowable costs for a grant-funded project for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa may be affected by the waiver process described at § 80.84(c).</P>
              <P>(d) The Regional Director may waive the 10-percent minimum Federal share of allowable costs if the State, District of Columbia, Commonwealth, or territory requests a waiver and provides compelling reasons to justify why it is necessary for the Federal government to fund less than 10 percent of the allowable costs of a project.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does the Service establish the non-Federal share of allowable costs?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To establish the non-Federal share of a grant-funded project for the 50 States, the Regional Director approves an application for Federal assistance in which the State fish and wildlife agency proposes the specific non-Federal share by estimating the Federal and match dollars, consistent with § 80.83(a).</P>
              <P>(b) To establish the non-Federal share of a grant-funded project for the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Regional Director:</P>
              <P>(1) Decides which percentage is fair, just, and equitable for the Federal share consistent with § 80.83(b) through (d);</P>
              <P>(2) Subtracts the Federal share percentage from 100 percent to determine the percentage of non-Federal share; and</P>
              <P>(3) Applies the percentage of non-Federal share to the allowable costs of a grant-funded project to determine the match requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) To establish the non-Federal share of a grant-funded project for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, the Regional Director must first calculate a preliminary percentage of non-Federal share in the same manner as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Following 48 U.S.C. 1469a, the Regional Director must then waive the first $200,000 of match to establish the final non-Federal match requirement for a project that includes funding from only one grant program or subprogram. If a project includes funds from more than one grant program or subprogram, the Regional Director must waive the first $200,000 of match applied to the funds for each program and subprogram.</P>

              <P>A State fish and wildlife agency must hold title to an ownership interest in real property acquired under a grant to the extent possible under State law.</P>
              <P>(a) Some States do not authorize their fish and wildlife agency to hold the title to real property that the agency manages. In these cases, the State or one of its administrative units may hold the title to grant-funded real property as long as the agency has the authority to manage the real property for its authorized purpose under the grant. The agency, the State, or another administrative unit of State government must not hold title to an undivided ownership interest in the real property concurrently with a subgrantee or any other entity.</P>
              <P>(b) An ownership interest is an interest in real property that gives the person who holds it the right to use and occupy a parcel of land or water and to exclude others. Ownership interests include fee and leasehold interests but not easements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Does an agency have to hold an easement acquired under a grant?</SUBJECT>
              <P>A State fish and wildlife agency must hold an easement acquired under a grant, but it may share certain rights or responsibilities as described in paragraph (b) of this section if consistent with State law.</P>
              <P>(a) Any sharing of rights or responsibilities does not diminish the agency's responsibility to manage the easement for its authorized purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency may share holding or enforcement of an easement only in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(1) The State or another administrative unit of State government may hold an easement on behalf of its fish and wildlife agency.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency may subgrant the concurrent right to hold the easement to a nonprofit organization or to a local or tribal government. A concurrent right to hold an easement means that both the State agency and the subgrantee hold the easement and share its rights and responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(3) The agency may subgrant a right of enforcement to a nonprofit organization or to a local or tribal government. This right of enforcement may allow the subgrantee to have reasonable access and entry to property protected under the easement for purposes of inspection, monitoring, and enforcement. The subgrantee's right of enforcement must not supersede and must be concurrent with the agency's right of enforcement.</P>

              <P>The regulations in this part establish the requirements for coastal State participation in the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program authorized by Section 305 of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (Pub L. 101-646, title III; 16 U.S.C. 3954). The primary goal of the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program is the long-term conservation of coastal wetlands ecosystems. It accomplishes this by helping States protect, restore, and enhance their coastal habitats through a competitive grants program. Results are measured in acres protected, restored, and enhanced.</P>

              <P>Terms used have the following meaning in this part:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Coastal barrier.</E> A depositional geologic feature that is subject to wave, tidal, and wind energies; protects landward aquatic habitats from direct wave attack; and includes all associated aquatic habitats such as adjacent wetlands, marshes, estuaries, inlets, and nearshore waters. These can include islands; spits of land connected to a mainland at one end; sand bars that connect two headlands and enclose aquatic habitat; broad, sandy, dune beaches; or fringing mangroves. Coastal barriers are found on coastlines including major embayments and the Great Lakes of the United States and its territories.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Coastal Barrier Resources System.</E> A defined set of undeveloped coastal areas, designated by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-348) and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-591). Within these defined units of the System, Federal expenditures are restricted to discourage development of coastal barriers.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Coastal States.</E> States bordering the Great Lakes (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin); States bordering the Atlantic, Gulf (except Louisiana), and Pacific coasts (Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington); and American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. (Louisiana is not included because it has its own wetlands conservation program authorized by the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act and implemented by the Corps of Engineers with assistance from the State of Louisiana, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce.)<PRTPAGE P="615"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Coastal wetland ecosystems.</E> Ecosystems that consist of multiple, interrelated coastal land features. They include wetlands in drainage basins of estuaries or coastal waters that contain saline, brackish, and nearshore waters; coastlines and adjacent lands; adjacent freshwater and intermediate wetlands that interact as an ecological unit; and river mouths and those portions of major river systems affected by tidal influence—all of which interact as an integrated ecological unit. Shorelands, dunes, nearshore islands, barrier islands and associated headlands, and freshwater wetlands within estuarine drainages are included in the definition since these interrelated features are critical to coastal fish, wildlife, and their habitats.</P>
              <P>The definition of a coastal wetland ecosystem also applies to the Great Lakes and their watersheds, where freshwater plays a similar hydrologic role. The Great Lakes coastal wetland ecosystem is made up of multiple interrelated coastal landscape features along the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes coastal wetland ecosystem includes wetlands located adjacent to any of the Great Lakes including Lake St. Clair and connecting waters, and mouths of river or stream systems draining directly into the Great Lakes. Shorelands, dunes, offshore islands, and barrier islands and associated headlands are included in the definition since these interrelated features are critical to Great Lakes fish, wildlife, and their habitats.</P>

                <E T="03">Fund.</E> A fund established and used by a coastal State for acquiring coastal wetlands, other natural areas, or open spaces. The fund can be a trust fund from which the principal is not spent, or a fund derived from a dedicated recurring source of monies including, but not limited to, real estate transfer fees or taxes, cigarette taxes, tax checkoffs, or motor vehicle license plate fees.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Grant.</E> An award of financial assistance by the Federal Government to an eligible applicant.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Long-term conservation.</E> Protecting and restoring terrestrial and aquatic environments for at least 20 years. This includes the hydrology, water quality, and fish and wildlife that depend on these environments.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Maintenance.</E> (These activities are ineligible under the program; the definition is included to distinguish these activities from acquisition, restoration, enhancement, and management.) Maintenance includes those activities necessary for upkeep of a facility or habitat. These activities include routine, recurring custodial maintenance such as housekeeping and minor repairs as well as the supplies, materials, and tools necessary to carry out the work. Also included is nonroutine cyclical maintenance to keep facilities or habitat improvements fully functional. Cyclical maintenance is major maintenance or renovation activities conducted at intervals normally greater than 1 year.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Management.</E> (Includes habitat management only.) Habitat management includes vegetation manipulation and restoration of habitat to support fish and wildlife populations. Creation of wetlands where they did not previously exist is not included in the definition of management.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Maritime forest.</E> Maritime forests are defined, for the purposes of this regulation, as broad-leaved forests that occur on barrier islands and along the mainland coast from Delaware to Texas. Examples are primarily characterized by a closed canopy of various combinations of live oak (<E T="03">Quercus virginiana</E>), upland laurel oak (<E T="03">Quercus hemisphaerica</E>), pignut hickory (<E T="03">Carya glabra</E>), southern magnolia (<E T="03">Magnolia grandiflora</E>), sugarberry (<E T="03">Celtis laevigata</E>), and cabbage palm (<E T="03">Sabal palmetto</E>). Shrubs and smaller trees typical <PRTPAGE P="616"/>of the understory include live oak, upland laurel oak, pignut hickory, red mulberry (<E T="03">Morus rubra</E>), wild olive (<E T="03">Osmanthus americanus</E>), American holly (<E T="03">Ilex opaca</E>), yaupon (<E T="03">Ilex vomitoria</E>), beautyberry (<E T="03">Callicarpa americana</E>), bumelia (<E T="03">Sideraxylon</E> spp.), and small-flowered pawpaw (<E T="03">Asimina parviflora</E>). The herb layer is generally rich and diverse, typically including partridgeberry (<E T="03">Mitchella repens</E>), coralbean (<E T="03">Erythrina herbacea</E>), small-leaved milk pea (<E T="03">Galactia microphylla</E>), tick trefoils (<E T="03">Desmodium</E> spp.), and spikegrass (<E T="03">Chasmanthium sessiliflorum</E>). Vines are represented by muscadine grape (<E T="03">Vitis rotundifolia</E>), Virginia creeper (<E T="03">Parrhenocissus quinquefolia</E>), and various briers (<E T="03">Smilax</E> spp.).</P>
              <P>This natural community type becomes established on old coastal dunes that have been stabilized long enough to sustain forests. In time, the accumulation of humus contributes to moisture retention of soils, while the canopy minimizes temperature fluctuations by reducing soil warming during the day and heat loss at night. Because of the underlying deep sands, maritime forests are generally well-drained.</P>
              <P>Maritime forests have become prime resort and residential property because of their relatively protected locations along the coast. Although this community type originally occurred in virtually continuous strips along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, residential developments and infrastructure encroachments have severely fragmented most occurrences.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">National Wetlands Inventory.</E> A Service program that produces information on the characteristics, extent, and status of the Nation's wetlands and deepwater habitat. The program's strongest mandates come from the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3901), which directs the Service to map wetlands, conduct wetlands status and trends studies, and disseminate the information produced.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan.</E> A plan developed by the Service for the U.S. Department of the Interior at the direction of Congress through the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3901).

              <P>
                <E T="03">Program.</E> The National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. A program administered by the Service that awards Federal grants through a competitive process to State agencies for projects to acquire, restore, manage, or enhance coastal wetlands.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Project.</E> One or more related activities necessary to fulfill a stated objective to provide for the long-term conservation of coastal wetlands including the lands and waters, hydrology, water quality, and wetland-dependent wildlife. These activities can include acquisition, restoration, enhancement, or management of coastal wetlands.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Restoration.</E> The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former or degraded wetland.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How are projects selected for grants?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Project selection is a three-step process: proposal acceptance, proposal ranking, and proposal selection.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Proposal acceptance.</E> (1) The Regional Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Offices decide whether a proposal should be accepted for consideration by determining if the proposal is complete, substantial, and contains activities that are eligible. Proposals that do not qualify are immediately returned to the State. Revision and resubmission of returned proposals is allowable during this period, which is in June (check with your Regional Office for the exact dates each year). If any of the factors of completeness, substantiality, or eligibility are not met, the Regions should not forward the proposal to Headquarters.</P>
              <P>(2) To be considered for acceptance, the proposal must be substantial in character and design. A substantial proposal is one that:</P>
              <P>(i) Identifies and describes a need within the purposes of the Act;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identifies the objective to be accomplished based on the stated need;</P>
              <P>(iii) Uses accepted principles, sound design, and appropriate procedures;</P>

              <P>(iv) Provides public conservation benefits that are cost effective and long-term, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, at least 20 years; and</P>
              <P>(v) Identifies obtainable, quantified performance measures (acres enhanced, restored, or protected) that help achieve the management goals and objectives of the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. Through this program, the States' efforts and leadership will help the Service meet its Long-Term and Annual Performance Goals as expressed in the Service's Annual Performance Plan. <SU>1</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(3) The grant limit is $1 million. Proposals requesting Program awards that exceed $1 million will be returned to the appropriate State. Similarly, individual projects that have clearly been divided into multiple proposals for submission in one grant cycle to avoid this limit will be returned to the appropriate State. The State can revise and resubmit the proposal so that the request does not exceed the $1 million limit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proposal ranking.</E> Once a proposal is accepted by the Region, the Regional Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Office sends the proposal to the National Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Office, which works with the National Office of the Fish and Wildlife Management and Habitat Restoration Program for distribution to a Review Panel. The Review Panel includes representation from our coastal Regions and from other Service Programs, for example, the Endangered Species Program. The Fisheries and Habitat Conservation Program is responsible for coordinating the review and ranking of proposals according to the established criteria, a process that usually involves a national meeting.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Proposal selection.</E> The Review Panel's recommendations are forwarded to the Director of the Service for a final review and project selection. The Director announces the selection by October 1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>An overview of the ranking criteria.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The primary objective of the proposal will be to acquire, restore, enhance, or manage coastal wetlands to benefit coastal wetlands and the hydrology, water quality, and fish and wildlife dependent upon them. The Program will not provide grants, for example, for construction or repair of boat <PRTPAGE P="620"/>ramps or docks for recreational purposes and construction or support of research facilities or activities. The purpose of the ranking criteria is to provide a means for selecting the best projects—those that produce the maximum benefits to coastal wetlands and the fish and wildlife that depend on them.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proposal ranking factors</E>—(1) <E T="03">Ranking criteria.</E> As explained in § 84.32, we will evaluate proposals according to 13 ranking criteria. These criteria have varying point values. Proposals must address each of these 13 criteria.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional considerations.</E> Even though the criteria provide the primary evaluation of proposals, we may factor additional considerations into the ranking decision at the national level. In case of a tie, we will use these additional considerations to rank proposals having identical scores.</P>
              <P>(c) The criteria in § 84.32 are not listed in priority order.</P>
              <P>(d) Points are assigned on the basis of a completed project, rather than current conditions, e.g., count 50 acres of estuarine emergent wetlands if 50 acres of that habitat type will be restored when the project is completed.</P>
              <P>(e) A range of points rather than a set point value allows the reviewer to distinguish between, for example, a proposal that provides some foraging habitat for a threatened species versus one that provides critical nesting habitat of several endangered species. Scoring guidance is included with the individual criteria.</P>
              <P>(f) A total of 64 points is possible under the scoring system.</P>
              <P>(g) If a grant proposal is not selected, the State may resubmit it for reconsideration in subsequent fiscal years. Resubmission of a grant proposal is the responsibility of the applicant.</P>

Include a breakdown showing the percentage of the proposal's total and wetland acreage in stable types. Provide National Wetlands Inventory codes/information if available.</P>
              <P>(iii) Wetlands benefited are less than 50 percent of the project area. (Up to 3 points)</P>
              <P>(iv) If the project would benefit wetlands in the upper portion of the coastal watershed, but does not demonstrate significant and direct benefits to coastal wetlands, the proposal will not receive any points. (0 points)</P>

              <P>(v) We will award a full 7 points to proposals that document that over 50 percent of their project area would be, upon project completion, decreasing coastal wetland types. A combination of decreasing and stable types that is over 50 percent of the project area could receive an intermediate score of <PRTPAGE P="621"/>4, 5, or 6 points, depending on the balance between decreasing and stable types. If wetlands are 50 percent or less of the project area, use the following guide for allocating points: 25 to 50 percent of the project area is decreasing or stable wetlands, 2, 3, or 4 points; 5 to 24 percent, 1 or 2 points; and less than 5 percent, 0 points.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Maritime forests on coastal barriers.</E> Will the proposal significantly benefit maritime forests on coastal barriers? The coastal barrier does not need to be a unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources System. (Maximum: 7 points)</P>
              <P>(i) The proposal documents significant benefit to maritime forests on a coastal barrier. Describe the forest in sufficient detail so reviewers can determine whether it meets the definition of “maritime forest.” (Up to 7 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The proposal does not benefit maritime forests on a coastal barrier. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) For this criterion most scores should be either 0 or 7. If questions arise about the significance of the benefit or whether the forests meet the strict definition, an intermediate score could be given.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Long-term conservation.</E> Does the project ensure long-term conservation of coastal wetland functions? The project must provide at least 20 years of conservation benefits to be eligible. (Maximum: 7 points)</P>
              <P>(i) Once the project is complete, the project will provide continuing coastal wetlands benefits in perpetuity (100 years or longer). (7 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) Once the project is complete, the project will provide continuing coastal wetland benefits for 50-99 years. (3 to 6 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) Once the project is complete, the proposal will provide continuing coastal wetlands benefits for 20-49 years. (1 to 3 points)</P>
              <P>(iv) The proposal should show how the project will be maintained and the benefits sustained over time. Proposals must include adequate documentation of long-term conservation of coastal wetland values, such as a 25-year easement, to receive points for this criterion. If part of the project's benefits will be perpetual (owned in fee title, for example) and part is estimated to last 20 years, reviewers should weigh the different elements of the project and give an intermediate score.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Coastal watershed management.</E> Would the completed project help accomplish the natural resource goals and objectives of one or more formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management plan(s) or effort(s)? Describe the management plan or effort(s). (Maximum: 3 points)</P>
              <P>(i) The project supports the natural resource goals of identified formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management plans or efforts. Describe the management plan(s) and/or effort(s) and explain how this project relates to its objectives. A plan that very specifically identifies the site will receive more points than a plan containing many generic references. (Up to 3 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The project does not support the natural resource goals and objectives of a formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management effort. If the proposal benefits the upper portions of coastal watersheds, but provides no significant and direct benefits to the coastal wetlands ecosystems, the proposal will not receive points.

Will it benefit State-listed threatened and endangered species? (Maximum: 5 points)</P>

              <P>(i) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat (e.g., nesting, breeding, feeding, nursery areas) for federally listed or proposed endangered or threatened species that use the coastal area project site for at least part of their life cycle. The project will benefit recently delisted species and habitat conservation plans developed under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act. List the species and their status (e.g., threatened or endangered) and provide documentation (e.g., cite recovery plan, attach letter from species expert) of current or recent species occurrence in the coastal area project site. Describe the importance of the habitat. (Up to 5 points)<PRTPAGE P="622"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat for State-listed threatened and endangered species. (Up to 2 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) The project will not provide, restore, or enhance important habitat for federally or State-listed or proposed endangered or threatened species in the coastal area project site for any part of their life cycle. If the proposal provides benefits to threatened and endangered species in the upper portion of the coastal watershed, but provides no significant and direct benefits to threatened and endangered species using coastal wetlands ecosystem habitat, the proposal will not receive any points. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iv) The combined scores of subparagraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section cannot exceed the 5-point maximum.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Benefits to fish.</E> Will the project provide, restore, or enhance important fisheries habitat? (Maximum: 5 points)</P>

              <P>(i) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, spawning, nursery, juvenile, or foraging habitat) for specific species that use the coastal area project site for at least part of their life cycle. These species may include anadromous, interjurisdictional, or other important species. List species, habitat types, and benefits to each species. (Up to 5 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The project does not document current or future benefits to fish species and their habitat. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) The more specific the information is on the use of the area and the importance of the habitat, the greater the points. An area specifically identified as critical for conservation in a fisheries management plan will, for example, receive more points than one which is not.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Benefits to coastal-dependent or migratory birds.</E> Will the project provide, restore, or enhance important habitat for coastal-dependent or migratory birds?</P>

              <P>(i) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, breeding, staging, foraging, wintering/summering habitat) benefits for at least part of the life cycle of coastal dependent or migratory birds. List the species and habitat types, and describe the benefits to each. (Up to 5 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The project will not significantly benefit coastal-dependent or migratory birds. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) We will give maximum points to projects that benefit coastal-dependent species identified in the North American Waterfowl Plan or listed as species of management concern. <SU>3</SU>
                <FTREF/> Proposals should also include information that demonstrates how the project will contribute to the regional goals developed under the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, Partners in Flight, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, or other bird conservation initiatives. Proposals that fail to do so will not receive maximum points. Indicate if the proposed area has been specifically identified by any program or agency for its migratory bird values.</P>

              <P>(8) <E T="03">Prevent or reduce contamination.</E> Will the project prevent or reduce input of contaminants to the coastal wetlands and associated coastal waters, or restore coastal wetlands and other associated coastal waters that are already contaminated? (Maximum: 5 points)</P>

              <P>(i) The project will prevent significant inputs of contaminants or will provide significant improvements to the quality of the coastal wetland and associated waters through protection from contaminants or restoration, including assimilation of nutrients and nonpersistent toxic substances. Describe the types and sources of possible or current impairment to the coastal wetland and other associated coastal waters (e.g., to water quality, sediments, flora, or fauna). Describe how contaminant inputs or residues will be prevented, reduced, or eliminated. Preventing contaminants by precluding residential development through acquisition will not normally warrant full points unless the applicant can be shown that significant contamination would have occurred otherwise. (Up to 5 points)<PRTPAGE P="623"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The proposal will not significantly prevent impairment or improve the quality of the coastal wetland and associated coastal waters. If the proposal provides positive water quality benefits in the upper portions of watersheds, but provides no significant and direct positive water quality benefits to coastal wetland ecosystems, the proposal will not receive points. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) Show direct links between contamination and wildlife and aquatic habitats. To receive full points, you should provide documentation of the linkage. Reviewers may consider the extent of contaminants prevention/reduction when assigning points. Proposals having the potential to produce an attractive nuisance (e.g., acquiring and/or restoring a wetland that will be attractive to wildlife and that also has the potential to accumulate high levels of persistent toxic metals or hydrocarbon compounds) will not receive points.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Catalyst for future conservation.</E> Is the project proposal designed to leverage other ongoing coastal wetlands protection projects in the area, such as acquisition of areas to add to already acquired coastal lands, or provide impetus for additional restoration? (Maximum: 4 points)</P>
              <P>(i) The project will be essential (e.g., key to completion or implementation of a greater conservation plan) to further advance or promote other coastal projects under way. Explain why. (Up to 4 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The project proposal does not demonstrate a positive impact on other coastal projects. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) To receive the maximum number of points, the proposal should be essential to the initiation or completion of a larger project. Examples may include acquisition of key in-holdings within a larger protected area, funds necessary to acquire fee simple interest in properties where a conservation easement has already been secured, and funds necessary to complete restoration activities to a protected area.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Partners in conservation.</E> Will the proposal receive financial support, including in-kind match, from private, local, or other Federal interests? (Maximum: 4 points)</P>
              <P>(i) The proposal includes the State applicant plus one or more non-State financial partners. (Up to 4 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The proposal includes only financial support from the State applicant. (0 points)</P>
              <P>(iii) A written description of commitment of funds or in-kind match from the partners must accompany the proposal. (This requirement is in addition to signing the Assurances Form.) The purpose of this criterion is to promote partnerships with private, local, or other Federal agencies rather than to increase the dollar amount of the matching share. Therefore, no specific minimum amount is indicated here. At least two partners, in addition to the State applicant, should have committed money to the project to receive maximum points.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Federal share reduced.</E> Does the proposal significantly reduce the Federal share by providing more than the required match amount? In the case of a Territory or Commonwealth that does not require match funds, does the proposal include financial support from sources other than the Territory or Commonwealth? (Maximum: 5 points)</P>
              <P>(i) The State, territory, or commonwealth applicant must have a non-Federal funding source (in-kind match does not count for this criterion) that reduces the Federal share. (Up to 5 points)</P>
              <P>(ii) The maximum Federal share is requested by the proposal. (0 points)</P>

              <P>(iii) The purpose of this criterion is to increase the amount of money from non-Federal sources. This increase decreases the need for Federal match dollars, so that Federal dollars can help more projects. Documentation of each partner's financial commitment must accompany the proposal to receive points. If the State itself provides the excess match, the State should receive credit for reducing the Federal share. Each 5 percent above the required State match would be approximately equal to 1 point. The following two examples, using both a 50 and 75 percent Federal match share, define a 10 percent increase in a State's match amount.

              <P>(a) Except for certain insular areas, the Federal share of an approved grant will not exceed 50 percent of approved costs incurred. However, the Federal share may be increased to 75 percent for coastal States that have established and are using a fund as defined in § 84.11. The Regions must certify the eligibility of the fund in order for the State to qualify for the 75 percent matching share.</P>

              <P>(b) The following insular areas: American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have been exempted from the matching share, as provided in Pub. L. 95-134, amended by Pub. L. 95-348, Pub. L. 96-<PRTPAGE P="626"/>205, Pub. L. 98-213, and Pub. L. 98-454 (48 U.S.C. 1469a). Puerto Rico is not exempt from the match requirements of this Program.</P>
              <P>(c) The State may provide materials (e.g., heavy equipment) or other services as a noncash match for portions of the State's matching share. The State may also provide the value of land, including the land proposed for restoration, enhancement, or management as a noncash match, provided that the land is necessary and reasonable for completing the project. For example, if a State proposes to manage a contiguous wetland of 100 acres, and already owns 10 of the 100 acres, the State can apply the current value of the 10 acres, provided that the 10 acres are necessary to manage the entire 100 acres. If the 10-acre wetland were not contiguous and no connection could be made that the 10 acres were needed to manage the proposed wetland, the State could not use the 10 acres as a noncash match. Review 43 CFR 12.64 for determining the value of in-kind contributions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the procedures for acquiring, maintaining, and disposing of real property?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of real property must follow the rules established in 43 CFR 12.71 and 50 CFR 80.14.</P>
              <P>(1) Title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant must be vested in the State or subgrantee, including local governments and nonprofit organizations. States must submit documentation (e.g., appraisals and appraisal reviews) to the Regional Director who must approve it before the State becomes legally obligated for the purchase. States will provide title vesting evidence and summary of land costs upon completion of the acquisition. The grant agreement and any deed to third parties (e.g., conservation easement or other lien on a third-party property) must include appropriate language to ensure that the lands and/or interests would revert back to the State or Federal Government if the conditions of the grant were no longer being implemented.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases where the interest obtained is less than fee simple title, the interest must be sufficient for long-term conservation of the specified wetlands resources.</P>
              <P>(3) Real property acquired with National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant funds must continue to serve the purpose for which it was acquired. If acquired property is used for reasons inconsistent with the purpose(s) for which acquired, such activities must cease and any adverse effects on the property must be corrected by the State or subgrantee with non-Federal monies in accordance with 50 CFR 80.14.</P>
              <P>(4) The State or subgrantee may not dispose of or encumber its title or other interest in real property without prior approval of the appropriate Regional Director of the Service. Real property includes, but is not limited to, lands, buildings, minerals, energy resources, timber, grazing, and animal products. If real property is sold, the State or subgrantee must compensate the Service in accordance with 43 CFR 12.71(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(5) If rights or interests obtained with the acquisition of coastal wetlands generate revenue during the Grant Agreement period, the State will treat the revenue as program income and use it to manage the acquired properties. If the State sells or leases real property, the State must treat the proceeds as program income and return the money to the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program regardless of the grant period.</P>
              <P>(6) Inconsistent use that is not corrected can be grounds for denying a State future grants under this Program.</P>
              <P>(b) A coastal State is responsible for design, supervision, and inspection of all major construction projects in accordance with accepted engineering standards.</P>
              <P>(1) The coastal State must have adequate rights to lands or waters where restoration or enhancement projects are planned to ensure protection and use of the facilities or structures throughout their useful life.</P>
              <P>(2) The construction, enlargement, or rehabilitation of dams are subject to Federal standards for dam design. If requested, the State must provide to the Regional Office written certification that any proposed changes to a dam meet Federal standards.</P>
              <P>(3) The coastal State must operate and maintain facilities, structures, or related assets to ensure their use for the stated project purpose and that they are adequately protected.</P>
              <P>(c) Acquisition, property records, maintenance, and disposal of equipment must be made in accordance with 43 CFR 12.72.</P>

              <P>All requests for additional monies for approved coastal wetland grants will be subject to the entire review process along with new grants. Any monies left over after the project is complete, or if the project is not completed, should be returned to Headquarters for use in following years. If a State has lands it wishes to acquire, restore, or enhance in close proximity to the original project, and the Region deems that spending project monies in these areas would provide similar benefits, the Region may use unspent balances to pay for these projects with prior approval from Headquarters. States must provide adequate justification and documentation to the Regions that the lands acquired, restored, or enhanced are similar to those in the original proposal and provide similar benefits to fish and wildlife.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Signs.</E> Facilities must display appropriate information signs at pumpout and portable toilet dump stations. Such information should indicate fees, restrictions, hours of operation, operating instructions, a contact name and 1-800-ASK-FISH telephone number for boaters to get additional information or to report an inoperable facility.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Pumpout symbol.</E> (1) At appropriate times, to increase public awareness of the Clean Vessel Act Pumpout Grant Program, use a pumpout symbol according to Service specifications. Use the pumpout symbol as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) As a sign at the entrance to a marina advertising the presence of a pumpout and/or portable toilet dump station;</P>
              <P>(ii) As a directional sign within a marina;</P>
              <P>(iii) As a sign at a pumpout and/or portable toilet dump station;</P>
              <P>(iv) As a symbol on educational and informational material; and</P>
              <P>(v) For other uses as appropriate to advance the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act.</P>
              <P>(2) To avoid confusion with having two symbols, use the selected symbol both for pumpout stations and portable dump stations. The Service encourages the use of this symbol as it is not copyrighted. The NOAA NOS magenta “P” within a magenta circle will continue to be used on nautical charts to identify the location of pumpout and portable toilet dump stations. NOAA will include information about the selected pumpout symbol in the U.S. Coast Pilots, a supplement to the charts, to relate this symbol to the NOAA Nautical Chart magenta “P” and circle.</P>
              <P>(3) All recipients identified in § 85.11 should display the appropriate pumpout symbol on facilities, such as pumpout and portable toilet dump stations, or on printed material or other visual representations relating to project accomplishments or education/information, and should encourage others to do so. Sub-recipients also should display the symbol and should encourage use by others for the purposes stated in this paragraph (b)(3).</P>
              <P>(4) The Service encourages other persons or organizations, such as marinas with pumpout stations not constructed with Clean Vessel Act funds, to use the symbol to advance the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act program.</P>
              <P>(5) The following specifications shall apply: The symbol is black, the background is white, and the border is international orange. There is no standard for the black and white, but use black and white colors, not shades. The standards for the international orange color is as follows: For day boards (signs), use retroflective international orange film. For paint, use international orange conforming to FED-STD 595B, chip number 12197 in daylight conditions. For inks, use Pantone Matching System color chart 179C. In order to ensure visibility after dark, use reflectorized film or paint, and/or artificial illumination. Pumpout symbol technical specifications to construct signs and for other purposes are available upon request.</P>
              <P>(6) The following rules govern the graphic reproduction of the symbol:</P>
              <P>(i) Do not use a smaller than legible symbol.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you reduce or enlarge the symbol, maintain the same proportions.</P>
              <P>(iii) Do not obscure the symbol by overprinting.</P>
              <P>(iv) Do not place the symbol where it will be split by unlike backgrounds.</P>
              <P>(v) Do not place the symbol on a background that is highly textured or patterned.</P>
              <P>(vi) When appropriate, for economical reasons, depict the symbol in one-color (black) with a white background, rather than two-color (international orange and black) with white background.</P>
              <P>(7) The pumpout symbol follows:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="246" SPAN="2">
                <PRTPAGE P="634"/>
                <GID>ER27AU97.010</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualifying signs.</E> (1) In conjunction with the symbol, you may use other qualifying signs below the symbol, either on the same sign or on a separate sign.</P>
              <P>(i) You may place the message “<E T="0071">P</E> PUMP OUT”, “<E T="0071">P</E> PUMPOUT STATION”, “<E T="0071">P</E> PORTABLE TOILET DUMP STATION”, or other appropriate qualifier, beneath the symbol. Place the magenta-colored “P” and circle in front of the message to relate the pumpout symbol to the NOAA NOS nautical charts. Messages may be appropriate for several years until the symbol is understood without the message. When appropriate, substitute a black “P” and circle for economical reasons.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may place directional arrows beneath the symbol to indicate the direction of pumpout or portable toilet dump station facilities.</P>
              <P>(2) The following specifications shall apply: Symbols, such as directional arrows, and letters, are black, and the background is white. For using inks to create the magenta color, use PMS color chart 259U. Letters and black and white colors shall follow the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD), FHWA, 1988. The Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, provides for sale copies of the 1988 MUTCD, including Revision No. 3, dated September 3, 1993, Stock No. 050-001-00308-2.</P>
              <P>(3) The same rules governing the graphic reproduction of the pumpout symbol, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, shall apply to qualifying signs.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Pumpout slogan.</E> (1) Use the pumpout slogan according to Service specifications to help increase boater awareness of the need to use pumpout and dump stations to properly dispose of their boat sewage. Use the slogan in conjunction with the pumpout symbol, on educational/informational material, and for other uses as appropriate to advance the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act. The slogan is not copyrighted, and the Service encourages its appropriate use.<PRTPAGE P="635"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) All recipients identified in § 85.11 should display the pumpout slogan on facilities, such as pumpout and portable toilet dump stations as appropriate, and on printed material or other visual representations relating to project accomplishments or education/information, and should encourage others to do so. Sub-recipients should display the slogan for purposes as stated above and should encourage others to do so.</P>
              <P>(3) The Service encourages other persons or organizations, such as marinas with pumpout stations not constructed with Clean Vessel Act funds, to use the slogan to advance the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act program.</P>
              <P>(4) The following specifications shall apply: Letters are black and background is white. The same reference under specifications for Qualifying Signs in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(5) The same rules governing the graphic reproduction of the pumpout symbol, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, shall apply to the pumpout slogan.</P>
              <P>(6) The pumpout slogan follows:
              </P>
              <FP>KEEP OUR WATER CLEAN—USE PUMPOUTS</FP>
              
              <P>(e) All information signs, pumpout symbol, qualifying signs, and pumpout slogan identified in this section and the crediting logo identified in § 85.47, inform and educate boaters. Therefore, use the signs, symbol, slogan and logo as appropriate. For instance, a sign on the water directing boaters to a pumpout may only need the pumpout symbol, and a qualifying sign beneath, e.g., an arrow, and possibly the words “PUMPOUT STATION”. For pumpout and dump stations, the pumpout symbol, slogan, information signs, including all information in paragraph (a) of this section, and the crediting and State logo may be appropriate. If desirable, add qualifying signs. Position a legible sign, symbol and logo either on the pumpout/dump station, on a separate sign, or both, for the greatest effect in informing and educating boaters. For other products such as print and video public service announcements, brochures, etc., the placement of symbols, etc. depends on space availability. The following order of priority dictates the order of use under limited space conditions: the pumpout symbol, slogan, 1-800-ASK-FISH telephone number and Sport Fish Restoration crediting logo. Add other information as appropriate. Use judgement when placing information on signs so as not to confuse the reader. Display the symbol, logo, slogan and information signs in the appropriate locations.

              <SUBJECT>What if a BIG-funded facility would benefit both eligible and ineligible users?</SUBJECT>
              <P>You may assign any share of the costs to the BIG grant only if the BIG-funded facility or a discrete element of the BIG-funded facility benefits only eligible users. If a cost does not exclusively benefit eligible users, you must allocate costs accordingly. A discrete element has a distinct purpose, such as a fuel station, pumpout facility, breakwater, or dock system.</P>
              <P>(a) You must clearly show and explain in the project statement:</P>
              <P>(1) The anticipated benefits of each project, discrete elements, and major components;</P>
              <P>(2) The breakdown of costs, as described at § 86.43(i), including the basis or method you use to allocate costs between eligible and ineligible users; and</P>
              <P>(3) Your reasoning in determining how to allocate costs, based on paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and any other guidance in the annual NOFO.</P>
              <P>(b) After you submit the application, if we do not agree with your cost allocation using paragraph (a) of this section, we will contact you. We may ask you to clarify your information. If we do not agree that the allocation is equitable, we may negotiate an equitable allocation. We must be able to agree that you are appropriately allocating costs between eligible and ineligible users based on the expected use before we consider your application for award.</P>
              <P>(c) If a proposed BIG-funded facility, or a discrete element, minor component, or single action of the BIG-funded project, gives a secondary or minimal benefit to all users, we will not require you to allocate costs between eligible and ineligible users for that benefit. Examples of how we will apply this rule are:</P>
              <P>(1) The primary purpose is to benefit eligible users directly, with the secondary benefit for both eligible and ineligible users. You must clearly state the exclusive benefit to eligible users in your application. The secondary benefit cannot exclude eligible users from the primary purpose. For example, if you construct a dock system for exclusive use by eligible vessels and a secondary benefit of the dock system is protection of the marina from wave action, you would not have to allocate costs for the secondary benefit. However, the secondary benefit cannot be docking for ineligible vessels because it would exclude eligible users from the primary purpose.</P>
              <P>(2) The secondary benefit to ineligible users is not the primary purpose, is minimal, and you do not add special features to accommodate ineligible users. For example, you do not have to allocate costs between user groups for a gangway from the transient dock, designed exclusively for eligible users, even though it is accessible to the general public. However, if you construct the gangway to accommodate the expected ineligible users, then you must allocate costs between user groups.</P>

              <P>(3) The expected benefits to both eligible and ineligible users have minimal value. If the component has a value of .0025 percent or less than the maximum available Federal award plus required match, you do not have to allocate costs for that component. We will post the amount of the minimal value each year in the annual NOFO. For example, <PRTPAGE P="645"/>if the total maximum Federal award and required match for a BIG Tier 2—National project is $2 million, you do not have to allocate costs between user groups for any discrete project element, component, or action with a value of $5,000 or less.</P>
              <P>(d) Examples of actions for which you must allocate costs between user groups are the following, unless paragraph (b) of this section applies:</P>
              <P>(1) You propose a 200-foot dock for eligible user tie-up spaces that you attach to the shore at a boat launch. It will attract ineligible use as a tie-up for boaters as they enter and exit the water. You must allocate costs between the expected eligible and ineligible use.</P>
              <P>(2) You propose a breakwater, fuel station, pumpout station, restroom, dredging, navigational aids, or other multiuse or multipurpose action.</P>
              <P>(e) Examples of actions for which you do not need to allocate costs between user groups are:</P>
              <P>(1) You propose to construct, renovate, or maintain docks specifically for eligible vessels.</P>
              <P>(2) You propose to produce information and educational materials specific to BIG.</P>
              <P>(f) You must clearly inform boaters when access by ineligible users is limited or restricted following the guidance at § 86.94.</P>
              <P>(g) We may ask you to clarify or change how you allocate costs in your grant application if they do not meet our standards. We may reject costs or applications that do not allocate costs between eligible and ineligible users according to the requirements of this section and the NOFO.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What if I need more than the maximum Federal share and required match to complete my BIG-funded project?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If you plan a BIG project that you cannot complete with the recommended maximum Federal award and the required match, you may:</P>
              <P>(1) Find other sources of non-Federal funds to complete the project;</P>
              <P>(2) Divide your larger project into smaller, distinct, stand-alone projects and apply for more than one BIG grant, either in the same year or in different years. One project cannot depend on the anticipated completion of another; or</P>
              <P>(3) Combine your BIG Tier 1—State and BIG Tier 2—National funding to complete a project at a single location.</P>
              <P>(b) If you are awarded a grant and find you cannot complete a BIG project with the Federal funds and required match, you may:</P>
              <P>(1) Find other sources of non-Federal funds to complete the project.</P>
              <P>(2) Consider if BIG Tier 1—State funds are available to help complete the project. This is not a guaranteed option.</P>
              <P>(3) Ask for approval to revise the grant by following the requirements at subpart H of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) For BIG Tier 2—National grants, we review and rank each application individually, and each must compete with other applications for the same award year.</P>
              <P>(d) If you receive a BIG grant for one of your applications, we do not give preference to other applications you submit.</P>
              <P>(e) If you do not complete your project, we may take one or more of the remedies for noncompliance found at 2 CFR 200.338, and any other regulations that apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What changes can I make in a grant application after I submit it?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After you submit your grant application, you can add or change information up to the date and time that the applications are due.</P>

              <P>(b) After the application due date and before we announce selected projects, you can add or change information in your application only if it does not affect the scope of the project, would not affect the score of the application, and <PRTPAGE P="650"/>is not a correction (see paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
              <P>(1) During this period we may ask you to change the useful life following the requirements at § 86.74 or allocation of costs between users of the BIG project following the requirements at § 86.19.</P>
              <P>(2) If your application proposes using BIG funds for an action we identify as ineligible, we will decide on a case-by-case basis whether we will allow you to change your application to remove identified ineligible costs and if we will consider your application for funding.</P>
              <P>(c) You must inform us of any incorrect information in an application as soon as you discover it, either before or after receiving an award.</P>
              <P>(d) We may ask you at any point in the application process to:</P>
              <P>(1) Clarify, correct, explain, or supplement data and information in the application;</P>
              <P>(2) Justify the eligibility of a proposed action; or</P>
              <P>(3) Justify the allowability of proposed costs or in-kind contributions.</P>
              <P>(e) If you do not respond fully to our questions at paragraph (d) of this section in the time allotted, we may decide not to consider your application for funding.</P>
              <P>(f) If your application is competitive, but funding is limited and we cannot fully fund your project, we may tell you the amount of available funds and ask you if you wish to accept the reduced funding amount. We will decide on a case-by-case basis if we will consider changes to the scope of your project based on the reduced funding. Any changes to the scope of a project must not result in reducing the number of points enough to lower your project's ranking position. If you choose to accept the reduced amount, you must amend your application to reflect all changes, including the difference in Federal and non-Federal funding.</P>

              <P>You must determine the useful life of your BIG-funded project using the following:</P>
              <P>(a) You must give an informed estimate of the useful life of the BIG-funded project in your grant application, including the information in Steps 1, 2, and 3, in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Identify all capital improvements that are proposed in your project. We may reject your application if you do not include an estimate for useful life.</P>
              <P>(i) Use the definition of <E T="03">capital improvement</E> at § 86.3.</P>
              <P>(ii) The capital improvement must be a structure or system that serves an identified purpose.</P>
              <P>(iii) Consider the function of the components in your application and group those with a similar purpose together as structures or systems.</P>
              <P>(iv) All auxiliary components of your project (those that are not directly part of the structure or system) must be identified as necessary for the continued use of an identified capital improvement. For example, a gangway is not part of the dock system, but is necessary for access to and from the dock system, so it could be included in the useful life of the dock system.</P>
              <P>(v) Attach an auxiliary component as identified at paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section to only one capital improvement. If it supports more than one, choose the one with the longest useful life.</P>

              <P>(vi) Examples of structures or systems that could potentially make up a single capital improvement are a: Rest room/shower building; dock system; breakwater; seawall; basin, as altered by dredging; or fuel station.<PRTPAGE P="655"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Estimate the useful life of each capital improvement identified in Step 1 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) State how you determine the useful life estimate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify factors that may influence the useful life of the identified capital improvement, such as: Marine environment, wave action, weather conditions, and heavy usage.</P>
              <P>(iii) Examples of sources to obtain estimates for useful life information when developing your application are: Vendors, engineers, contractors, or others with expertise or experience with a capital improvement.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> If you are asking us to consider additional points for a physical component, technology, or technique under the criterion at § 86.51(c) that will increase the useful life, you must describe in your application:</P>
              <P>(i) The capital improvement or component that you will apply the criterion at § 86.51(c) to;</P>
              <P>(ii) The expected increase in useful life;</P>
              <P>(iii) The sources of information that support your determination of an extended useful life; and</P>
              <P>(iv) A description of how you expect the useful life will be increased.</P>
              <P>(b) After you submit your application, but before we award your grant, you must:</P>
              <P>(1) Confirm the useful life for each capital improvement using a generally accepted method.</P>
              <P>(2) Provide any additional documents or information, if we request it.</P>
              <P>(3) Consult and obtain agreement for your final useful life determinations at the State or Regional level, or both.</P>
              <P>(4) Revise your application, as needed, to include the final useful life determination(s).</P>
              <P>(c) If we find before we award the grant that you are unable to support your determination of an extended useful life at § 86.51(c), we will reduce your score and adjust the ranking of applications accordingly.</P>
              <P>(d) You must finalize useful life in your grant by one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(i) State several useful-life expectations, one for each individual capital improvement you identified at paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) State a single useful life for the whole project, based on the longest useful life of the capital improvements you identified at paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>Section 1 of the Act of July 3, 1956, as amended (70 Stat. 492; 7 U.S.C. 442-445) provides that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall make available to the Secretary of the Interior such wheat, corn, or other grains, acquired through price support operations and certified by the Corporation to be available for purposes of the Act or in such condition through spoilage or deterioration as not to be desirable for human consumption, as the Secretary shall requisition for the purpose of preventing crop damage by migratory waterfowl. Section 2 of the Act provides that, upon a finding that any area in the United States is threatened with damage to farmers' crops by migratory waterfowl, the Secretary is authorized and directed to requisition from the Commodity Credit Corporation and to make available to Federal, State, or local governmental bodies or officials, or to private organizations or persons, such grain acquired by the Corporation through price support operations in such quantities and subject to such regulations as the Secretary determines will most effectively lure migratory waterfowl away from crop depredations and at the same time not expose such migratory waterfowl to shooting over areas to which the waterfowl have been lured by such feeding programs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interpretation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The authorization contained in the Act limits the availability of grain acquired through price support operations to the prevention of crop damage by migratory waterfowl (brant, wild ducks, geese, and swans) and such grain may not be made available for the feeding of any other species of migratory birds, whether or not such other species of migratory birds are committing or threatening to commit crop damage. Further, the Act does not authorize the use of such grain to conduct a migratory waterfowl feeding program for the purpose of augmenting natural sources of food available to migratory waterfowl, nor for any purpose incident to migratory waterfowl management not related to the prevention of crop damage. Accordingly, such grain shall not be made available pursuant to the Act to augment or to substitute for natural sources of migratory waterfowl food except as may be determined by the Secretary to be necessary to aid in the prevention of crop damage by such birds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Whenever it is found necessary to conduct feeding programs under this section for the purposes of preventing crop damage by migratory waterfowl, it shall be the policy of the Secretary for the purposes of economy and efficiency to accord preference to feeding programs proposed to be executed through the placement of grain upon wildlife management areas or other lands or waters owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by an agency of the United States or a State.</P>

              <P>Any person having an interest in crops being damaged or threatened with damage by migratory waterfowl in circumstances meeting the criteria prescribed in § 90.15 may make application for grain for use in luring such waterfowl away from such crops by submitting a written request to the Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regional office having administrative jurisdiction over the wildlife activities in the State where the affected crops are located. (See § 2.2 for geographical jurisdiction and addresses of regional offices.) Such applications may be in letter form but must contain information disclosing the location, nature, condition and extent of the crops being damaged or threatened, and the particular species of migratory waterfowl committing or threatening to commit damage. For the purposes of this section any authorized official of Federal, State, or local governmental body shall be deemed to be a “person” and to have such an interest in crops threatened with damages as to qualify him as an applicant.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 90.15</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Criteria to govern approval of applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Upon receipt of a written application for such grain for use in preventing crop depredations, the Regional Director shall promptly cause an investigation to be made, when necessary, to determine whether the applicant is in fact entitled to have such grain made available for such purposes. Whenever feasible the required investigation shall be made jointly by a representative of the game department of the State in which the affected crops are located and a representative of the Regional Director. When conducting such investigations, each of the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section shall be considered separately. An application for grain shall not be approved if it is determined that one or more of these factors minimizes the extent of crop damage or provides another effective method of preventing the complained of damage.</P>
              <P>(a) The migratory waterfowl committing or threatening to commit crop damage must be predominantly of a species which are susceptible of being effectively lured away from the crops by the use of such grain.</P>
              <P>(b) The crop damage or threatened crop damage must be substantial in nature (when measured by the extent and potential value of the crops involved and the number of birds threatening damage); and must affect growing crops or mature unharvested crops that are in such condition as to be marketable or have value as feed for livestock or other purposes of material value to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) It must be shown that the damage or threat of damage cannot be abated through the exercise of any of the privileges granted in permits authorized by this chapter I to frighten or otherwise herd migratory waterfowl away from affected crops.</P>
              <P>(d) During an open hunting season, it must be shown that the area affected by crop damage has been and is now open to public hunting and there has been a clear demonstration that such hunting is ineffective, and cannot be made effective, to prevent crop damage on such area.</P>

              <P>Upon receipt of a report and recommendations based upon an investigation conducted under § 90.15, the Secretary shall make a determination that the applicant meets the qualifications for receiving grain. He shall then determine the quantity of grain, either bagged or in bulk, to be made available; the means of transportation; and the point of delivery in the vicinity of the crop damage. Before receiving delivery of such grain the applicant shall <PRTPAGE P="662"/>execute and deliver to any officer authorized to enforce this part written assurances as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) That grain made available to him under this part will be used exclusively for the prevention and abatement of crop damage by migratory waterfowl and that no portion of such grain will be sold, donated, exchanged, or used as feed for livestock or other domestic animals or for any other purpose;</P>
              <P>(b) That consent is granted to any officer authorized to enforce this part, to inspect, supervise or direct the placement and distribution of grain made available under this part for the prevention of crop damage at all reasonable times;</P>
              <P>(c) That free and unrestricted access over the premises on which feeding operations have been or are to be conducted shall be permitted at all reasonable times, by any officer authorized to enforce this part and that such information as may be required by the officer will be promptly furnished; and</P>
              <P>(d) That the applicant will not take, nor permit his agents, employees, invitees, or other persons under his control to take migratory game birds on or over any lands or waters subject to his control, during the time such grain is placed, exposed, deposited, distributed, scattered, or present upon such lands or waters, nor for a period of 10 days immediately following the consumption or removal of such grain from such lands or waters.</P>

The design must be the contestant's original hand-drawn creation. The entry design may not be copied or duplicated from previously published art, including photographs, or from images in any format published on the internet. Photographs, computer-generated art, or art produced from a computer printer or other computer/mechanical output device (airbrush method excepted) are not eligible to be entered into the contest and will be disqualified.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The regulations in this part apply to all eligible persons harvesting migratory birds and their eggs for subsistence purposes in Alaska between the dates of March 10 and September 1. The provisions in this part do not replace or alter the regulations set forth in part 20 of this chapter, which relate to the hunting of migratory game birds and crows during the regular open season from September 1 through March 10.

              <SUBJECT>Who is eligible to participate?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If you are a permanent resident of a village within a subsistence harvest area, you will be eligible to harvest migratory birds and their eggs for subsistence purposes during the applicable periods specified in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Included areas.</E> Village areas located within the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak Archipelago, the Aleutian Islands, or in areas north and west of the Alaska Range are subsistence harvest areas, except that villages within these areas not meeting the criteria for a subsistence harvest area as identified in paragraph (c) of this section will be excluded from the spring and summer subsistence harvest.</P>

              <P>(1) Any person may request the Co-management Council to recommend that an otherwise included area be excluded by submitting a petition stating how the area does not meet the criteria identified in paragraph (c) of this section. The Co-management Council will forward petitions to the appropriate regional management body. The Co-management Council will then consider each petition and will submit to the Service any recommendations to exclude areas from the spring and summer subsistence harvest. The Service will publish any approved recommendations for public comment in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Based on petitions for inclusion recommended by the Co-management Council, the Service has added the following communities to the included areas under this part:</P>
              <P>(i) Upper Copper River Region—Gulkana, Gakona, Tazlina, Copper Center, Mentasta Lake, Chitina, Chistochina.</P>
              <P>(ii) Gulf of Alaska Region—Chugach Community of Tatitlek, Chugach Community of Chenega, Chugach Community of Port Graham, Chugach Community of Nanwalek.</P>
              <P>(iii) Cook Inlet Region—Tyonek.<PRTPAGE P="670"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Southeast Alaska Region—Hoonah, Craig, Hydaburg, and Yakutat.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Excluded areas.</E> Excluded areas are not subsistence harvest areas and are closed to harvest. Residents of excluded areas are not eligible persons as defined in § 92.4. Communities located within the excluded areas provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section may petition the Co-management Council through their regional management body for designation as a spring and summer subsistence harvest area. The petition must state how the community meets the criteria identified in paragraph (c) of this section. The Co-management Council will consider each petition and will submit to the Service any recommendations to designate a community as a spring and summer subsistence harvest area. The Service will publish any approved new designations of communities for public comment in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Excluded areas consist of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) All areas outside of Alaska.</P>
              <P>(2) Village areas located in Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Kenai Peninsula roaded area, the Gulf of Alaska roaded area, Southeast Alaska, and the Central Interior Excluded Area as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section generally do not qualify for a spring and summer harvest.</P>
              <P>(3) The Central Interior Excluded Area comprises the following: That portion of Unit 20(A) east of the Wood River drainage and south of Rex Trail, including the upper Wood River drainage south of its confluence with Chicken Creek; that portion of Unit 20(C) east of Denali National Park north to Rock Creek and east to Unit 20(A); and that portion of Unit 20(D) west of the Tanana River between its confluence with the Johnson and Delta Rivers, west of the east bank of the Johnson River, and north and west of the Volmar drainage, including the Goodpaster River drainage. The following communities are within the Excluded Area: Delta Junction/Big Delta/Fort Greely, McKinley Park/Village, Healy, Ferry, and all residents of the formerly named Fairbanks North Star Borough Excluded Area.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Criteria for determining designation as a spring and summer subsistence harvest area.</E> A previously excluded community may be included in the spring/summer harvest regulations if recommended by the Alaska Migratory Bird Co-management Council. The Alaska Migratory Bird Co-management Council will recommend designation of subsistence harvest areas based on a deliberative process using the best available information on nutritional and cultural needs and customary and traditional use. The Alaska Migratory Bird Co-management Council recommendations will accommodate traditional spring and summer harvests without creating new traditions or increasing harvest of migratory birds. Recommendations will be made based on the majority of factors and the weight of the evidence using the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) A pattern of use recurring in the spring and summer of each year prior to 1999, excluding interruptions by circumstances beyond the user's control;</P>
              <P>(2) The consistent harvest and use of migratory birds on or near the user's permanent residence;</P>
              <P>(3) A use pattern that includes the handing down of knowledge of hunting skills and values from generation to generation;</P>
              <P>(4) A use pattern in which migratory birds are shared or distributed among others within a definable community of persons; a community for purposes of subsistence uses may include specific villages or towns, with a historical pattern of subsistence use; and</P>
              <P>(5) A use pattern that includes reliance for subsistence purposes upon migratory birds or their eggs and that meets nutritional and other essential needs including, but not limited to, cultural, social, and economic elements of the subsistence way of life.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Participation by permanent residents of excluded areas.</E> Immediate family members who are residents of excluded areas may participate in the customary spring and summer subsistence harvest in a village's subsistence area with permission of the village council, to assist indigenous inhabitants in meeting their nutritional and other essential needs or for the teaching of cultural knowledge. A letter of invitation will be sent by the village council to the hunter with a copy to <PRTPAGE P="671"/>the Executive Director of the Co-management Council, who will inform law enforcement and the Service's Co-management Council coordination office within 2 working days. The Service will then inform any affected Federal agency when residents of excluded areas are allowed to participate in the subsistence harvest within their Federal lands.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regional management areas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Regions identified.</E> To allow for maximum participation by residents of subsistence eligible areas, the Alaska Regional Director of the Service established 12 geographic regions based on common subsistence resource use patterns and the 12 Alaska Native regional corporation boundaries established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Despite using the Alaska Native regional corporation boundaries, we are not working directly with the regional corporations in this program and are instead working with the Alaska Native nonprofit groups and local governments in those corresponding regions. You may obtain records and maps delineating the boundaries of the 12 regions from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Alaska State Office, 222 West 7th Ave., No. 13, Anchorage, AK 99513. The regions are identified as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Aleutian/Pribilof Islands;</P>
              <P>(2) Kodiak Archipelago;</P>
              <P>(3) Bristol Bay;</P>

              <P>(12) Cook Inlet.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Regional partnerships.</E> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will establish partner agreements with at least 1 partner organization in each of the 12 regions. The partner organization identified must be willing and able to coordinate the regional program on behalf of all subsistence hunters within that region. A regional partner will:</P>
              <P>(1) Organize or identify one or more management bodies within the region in which it is located.</P>
              <P>(2) Determine how the management body for the region should be organized, the manner in which it should function, its size, who serves on it, the length of terms, methods of involving subsistence users, and other related matters.</P>
              <P>(3) Coordinate regional meetings and the solicitation of proposals.</P>
              <P>(4) Ensure appointment of a person to represent the region by serving on the Co-management Council. If a region consists of more than one partner organization, each partner organization may appoint a member to sit on the Co-management Council.</P>
              <P>(5) Keep the residents of villages within the region informed of issues related to the subsistence harvest of migratory birds.</P>
              <P>(6) Work cooperatively with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to gather harvest data, numbers of subsistence users, and other management data and traditional knowledge for the benefit of the management bodies.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Regional management bodies.</E> (1) Regional management bodies must provide a forum for the collection and expression of opinions and recommendations regarding spring and summer subsistence harvesting of migratory birds. They must develop requests and recommendations from the region to be presented to the Co-management Council for deliberation. They must provide for public participation in the meetings at which recommendations and requests are formulated.</P>

              <P>(2) Requests and recommendations to the Co-management Council may involve seasons and bag limits, methods and means, law enforcement policies, population and harvest monitoring, education programs, research and use <PRTPAGE P="674"/>of traditional knowledge, habitat protection, and other concerns related to migratory bird subsistence programs.</P>
              <P>(3) Regional management bodies may be established specifically for the purpose of carrying out the responsibilities identified in this part, or they may be existing entities that can add these responsibilities to their existing duties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General overview of regulations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>These regulations establish a spring/summer migratory bird subsistence harvest in Alaska. The regulations list migratory bird species that are authorized for harvest, species that are not authorized for harvest, season dates, and dates for a 30-day closure to protect nesting birds. The Co-management Council will review and, if necessary, recommend modifications to these harvest regulations on an annual basis, working within the schedule of the Federal late-season regulations for migratory game bird hunting.</P>
              <P>(a) The taking, possession, transportation, and other uses of migratory birds are generally prohibited unless specifically authorized by regulation developed in accordance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Therefore, harvesting migratory birds is prohibited unless regulations are established ensuring the protection of the various populations of migratory birds. Migratory bird population levels, production, and habitat conditions vary annually. These conditions differ within Alaska and throughout North America. Therefore, the regulations governing migratory bird hunting may include annual adjustments to keep harvests within acceptable levels.</P>
              <P>(b) The development of the regulations in this part, like the development of the annual migratory game bird hunting regulations in part 20 of this chapter, involves annual data gathering programs to determine migratory bird population status and trends, evaluate habitat conditions, determine harvests, and consider other factors having an impact on the anticipated size of annual populations.</P>

              <P>(c) The Service proposes annual migratory game bird hunting regulations in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in the spring for seasons beginning September 1 of that year. Following consideration of additional biological information and public comment, the Service publishes supplemental proposals throughout the summer. These are also open to public comment.</P>
              <P>(d) Sections 92.31 through 92.39 provide for the annual harvest of migratory birds and their eggs during spring and summer for subsistence users in Alaska.</P>

              <P>Upon finding that continuation of these subsistence regulations would pose an imminent threat to the conservation of threatened Steller's eiders <E T="03">(Polysticta stelleri),</E> the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska Regional Director, in consultation with the Co-management Council, will immediately under § 92.21 take action as is necessary to prevent further take. Regulation changes implemented could range from a temporary closure of duck hunting in a small geographic area to large-scale regional or statewide long-term closures of all subsistence migratory bird hunting. These closures or temporary suspensions will remain in effect until the Regional Director, in consultation with the Co-management Council, determines that the potential for additional Steller's eiders to be taken no longer exists.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility for subsistence use.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You may take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses only if you are an Alaska resident of a rural area or rural community. The regulations in this part may further limit your qualifications to harvest fish or wildlife resources for subsistence uses. If you are not an Alaska resident or are a resident of a non-rural area or community listed in § 100.23, you may not take fish or wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Where the Board has made a customary and traditional use determination regarding subsistence use of a specific fish stock or wildlife population, in accordance with, and as listed in, § 100.24, only those Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities designated by the Board are eligible for subsistence taking of that population or stock on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in this part. If you do not live in one of those areas <PRTPAGE P="689"/>or communities, you may not take fish or wildlife from that population or stock, on public lands under the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) Where customary and traditional use determinations for a fish stock or wildlife population within a specific area have not yet been made by the Board (e.g., “no determination”), all Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities may harvest for subsistence from that stock or population under the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.</P>

              <P>(a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses, you must be an eligible rural Alaska resident and:</P>
              <P>(1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish, but you must be an Alaska resident) unless Federal licenses are required or unless otherwise provided for in subpart D of this part;</P>
              <P>(2) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent Federal permits (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit) required by subpart D of this part; and</P>
              <P>(3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the requirements in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to receive a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit or designate someone to harvest fish or wildlife for you under a Federal Designated Harvester Permit, you must be old enough to reasonably harvest that species yourself (or under the guidance of an adult).</P>
              <P>(c) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal law enforcement agent, you must also produce any licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, or other documents required by this section. If you are engaged in taking fish and wildlife under the regulations in this part, you must allow State or Federal law enforcement agents to inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or capable of being used to take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife in your possession.</P>
              <P>(d) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is a violation of the regulations in this part. Community harvests are reviewed annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an incorrect harvest report.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Information collection requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The rules in this part contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.</P>
              <P>(1) Section 100.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports. The information collection requirements contained in § 100.6 (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. Identity and location of residence are required to determine if you are eligible for a permit and a report of success is required after a harvest attempt. These requirements are not duplicative with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The regulations in § 100.6 require this information before a rural Alaska resident may engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The Department estimates that the average time necessary to obtain and comply with this permit information collection requirement is 0.25 hours.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 100.20, Request for reconsideration. The information collection requirements contained in § 100.20 provide a standardized process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.</P>
              <P>(3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible, and information gained from these reports is systematically available to Federal managers by routine computer access requiring less than 1 hour.</P>
              <P>(b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of the burden estimate to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b). Additional information requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory Committees or additional Regional Councils, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B of this part. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.</P>

              <P>(1) The Board may make such temporary changes only after it determines that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an unnecessary restriction on nonsubsistence users. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted.</P>

              <P>(a) The Federal Subsistence Board has determined that rural Alaska residents of the listed communities, areas, and individuals have customary and traditional use of the specified species on Federal public land in the specified areas.

This restriction does not apply to subsistence taking of deer (except on NPS lands) and of caribou on the Nushagak Peninsula (a portion of Units 17A and 17C) during Jan. 1-Mar. 31, provided the hunter is 300 feet from the airplane; moreover, this restriction does not apply to subsistence setting of snares or traps, or the removal of furbearers from traps or snares.</P>
              <P>(17) Taking a bear cub or a sow accompanied by cub(s).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Defense of life and property.</E> Wildlife taken in defense of life or property is not a subsistence use; wildlife so taken is subject to State regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Trapping furbearing animals.</E> The following methods and means of trapping furbearers for subsistence uses pursuant to the requirements of a trapping license are prohibited, in addition to the prohibitions listed at paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Disturbing or destroying a den, except that you may disturb a muskrat pushup or feeding house in the course of trapping;</P>
              <P>(2) Disturbing or destroying any beaver house;</P>
              <P>(3) Taking beaver by any means other than a steel trap or snare, except that you may use firearms in certain Units with established seasons as identified in Unit-specific regulations found in this subpart;</P>

              <P>(6) Taking or assisting in the taking of furbearers by firearm before 3:00 a.m. on the day following the day on which airborne travel occurred; however, this does not apply to a trapper using a firearm to dispatch furbearers caught in a trap or snare.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Possession and transportation of wildlife.</E> (1) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(2) or (f)(1) of this section, or as otherwise provided, you may not take a species of wildlife in any Unit, or portion of a Unit, if your total take of that species already obtained anywhere in the State under Federal and State regulations equals or exceeds the harvest limit in that Unit.</P>
              <P>(2) An animal taken under Federal or State regulations by any member of a community with an established community harvest limit for that species counts toward the community harvest limit for that species. Except for wildlife taken pursuant to § __.10(d)(5)(iii) or as otherwise provided for by this part, an animal taken as part of a community harvest limit counts toward every community member's harvest limit for that species taken under Federal or State of Alaska regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Harvest limits.</E> (1) The harvest limit specified for a trapping season for a <PRTPAGE P="720"/>species and the harvest limit set for a hunting season for the same species are separate and distinct. This means that if you have taken a harvest limit for a particular species under a trapping season, you may take additional animals under the harvest limit specified for a hunting season or vice versa.</P>
              <P>(2) A brown/grizzly bear taken in a Unit or portion of a Unit having a harvest limit of “one brown/grizzly bear per year” counts against a “one brown/grizzly bear every four regulatory years” harvest limit in other Units. You may not take more than one brown/grizzly bear in a regulatory year.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Evidence of sex and identity.</E> (1) If subsistence take of Dall sheep is restricted to a ram, you may not possess or transport a harvested sheep unless both horns accompany the animal.</P>
              <P>(2) If the subsistence taking of an ungulate, except sheep, is restricted to one sex in the local area, you may not possess or transport the carcass of an animal taken in that area unless sufficient portions of the external sex organs remain attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the animal, except that in Units 1-5 antlers are also considered proof of sex for deer if the antlers are naturally attached to an entire carcass, with or without the viscera; and except in Units 11, 13, 19, 21, and 24, where you may possess either sufficient portions of the external sex organs (still attached to a portion of the carcass) or the head (with or without antlers attached; however, the antler stumps must remain attached) to indicate the sex of the harvested moose. However, this paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption upon arrival at the location where it is to be consumed.</P>
              <P>(3) If a moose harvest limit requires an antlered bull, an antler size, or configuration restriction, you may not possess or transport the moose carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or its parts. If you possess a set of antlers with less than the required number of brow tines on one antler, you must leave the antlers naturally attached to the unbroken, uncut skull plate; however, this paragraph (g)(3) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption after arrival at the place where it is to be stored or consumed.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Removing harvest from the field.</E> You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters and hind quarters of caribou and moose harvested in Units 9, 17, 18, and 19B prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of moose harvested in Unit 21 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 24 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. Meat of the front quarters, hind quarters, or ribs from a harvested moose or caribou may be processed for human consumption and consumed in the field; however, meat may not be removed from the bones for purposes of transport out of the field. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 25 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Returning of tags, marks, or collars.</E> If you take an animal that has been marked or tagged for scientific studies, you must, within a reasonable time, notify the ADF&amp;G or the agency identified on the collar or marker when and where the animal was taken. You also must retain any ear tag, collar, radio, tattoo, or other identification with the hide until it is sealed, if sealing is required; in all cases, you must return any identification equipment to the ADF&amp;G or to an agency identified on such equipment.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Sealing of bear skins and skulls.</E> (1) Sealing requirements for bear apply to brown bears taken in all Units, except as specified in this paragraph (j), and black bears of all color phases taken in Units 1-7, 11-17, and 20.<PRTPAGE P="721"/>

              <P>(v) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 9E from Unit 9, you must first have it sealed by an authorized sealing representative. At the time of sealing, the representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.</P>
              <P>(4) You may not falsify any information required on the sealing certificate or temporary sealing form provided by the ADF&amp;G in accordance with State regulations.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Sealing of beaver, lynx, marten, otter, wolf, and wolverine.</E> You may not possess or transport from Alaska the untanned skin of a marten taken in Unit 1-5, 7, 13E, or 14-16 or the untanned skin of a beaver, lynx, otter, wolf, or wolverine, whether taken inside or outside the State, unless the skin has been sealed by an authorized representative in accordance with State or Federal regulations.</P>
              <P>(1) In Unit 18, you must obtain an ADF&amp;G seal for beaver skins only if they are to be sold or commercially tanned.</P>

              <P>(1) The harvest does not violate recognized principles of wildlife conservation and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations. The appropriate Federal land manager will establish the number, species, sex, or location of harvest, if necessary, for conservation purposes. Other regulations relating to ceremonial harvest may be found in the Unit-specific regulations in paragraph (n) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="722"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) No permit or harvest ticket is required for harvesting under this section; however, the harvester must be a federally qualified subsistence user with customary and traditional use in the area where the harvesting will occur.</P>

              <P>(B) Unit 22B consists of Norton Sound drainages from, but excluding, the Ungalik River drainage to, and including, the Topkok Creek drainage.</P>
              <P>(C) Unit 22C consists of Norton Sound and Bering Sea drainages from, but excluding, the Topkok Creek drainage to, and including, the Tisuk River drainage, and King and Sledge Islands.</P>

              <P>(ii) You may hunt brown bear by State registration permit in lieu of a resident tag if you have obtained a State registration permit prior to hunting. Aircraft may not be used in any manner for brown bear hunting under the authority of a brown bear State registration permit, including transportation of hunters, bears, or parts of bears; however, this does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unit-specific regulations:</P>
              <P>(A) If you have a trapping license, you may use a firearm to take beaver in Unit 22 during the established seasons.</P>
              <P>(B) Coyote, incidentally taken with a trap or snare, may be used for subsistence purposes.</P>
              <P>(C) A snowmachine may be used to position a hunter to select individual caribou for harvest provided that the animals are not shot from a moving snowmachine.</P>
              <P>(D) The taking of one bull moose and up to three musk oxen by the community of Wales is allowed for the celebration of the Kingikmuit Dance Festival under the terms of a Federal registration permit. Permits will be issued to individuals only at the request of the Native Village of Wales. The harvest may occur only within regularly established seasons in Unit 22E. The harvest will count against any established quota for the area.</P>
              <P>(E) A federally qualified subsistence user (recipient) may designate another federally qualified subsistence user to take musk oxen on his or her behalf unless the recipient is a member of a community operating under a community harvest system. The designated hunter must get a designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients in the course of a season, but have no more than two harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time, except in Unit 22E where a resident of Wales or Shishmaref acting as a designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients, but have no more than four harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time.</P>

              <P>(23) <E T="03">Unit 23.</E> (i) Unit 23 consists of Kotzebue Sound, Chukchi Sea, and Arctic Ocean drainages from and including the Goodhope River drainage to Cape Lisburne.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the following areas, the taking of wildlife for subsistence uses is prohibited or restricted on public land:</P>

              <P>(A) You may not use aircraft in any manner either for hunting of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine, or for transportation of hunters or harvested species in the Noatak Controlled Use Area for the period August 15-September 30. The Area consists of that portion of Unit 23 in a corridor extending 5 miles on either side of the Noatak River beginning at the mouth of the Noatak River, and extending upstream to the mouth of Sapun Creek. This closure does not apply to the transportation of hunters or parts of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine by regularly scheduled flights to communities by <PRTPAGE P="757"/>carriers that normally provide scheduled air service.</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(iii) You may not use aircraft in any manner for brown bear hunting, including transportation of hunters, bears, or parts of bears; however, this does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.</P>
              <P>(iv) Unit-specific regulations:</P>
              <P>(A) You may take caribou from a boat moving under power in Unit 23.</P>
              <P>(B) In addition to other restrictions on method of take found in this section, you may also take swimming caribou with a firearm using rimfire cartridges.</P>
              <P>(C) If you have a trapping license, you may take beaver with a firearm in all of Unit 23 from Nov. 1-June 10.</P>
              <P>(D) For the Baird and DeLong Mountain sheep hunts—A federally qualified subsistence user (recipient) may designate another federally qualified subsistence user to take sheep on his or her behalf unless the recipient is a member of a community operating under a community harvest system. The designated hunter must obtain a designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The designated hunter may hunt for only one recipient in the course of a season and may have both his and the recipients' harvest limits in his/her possession at the same time.</P>
              <P>(E) A snowmachine may be used to position a hunter to select individual caribou for harvest provided that the animals are not shot from a moving snowmachine. On BLM-managed lands only, a snowmachine may be used to position a caribou, wolf, or wolverine for harvest provided that the animals are not shot from a moving snowmachine.</P>
              <P>(F) A federally qualified subsistence user (recipient) may designate another federally qualified subsistence user to take musk oxen on his or her behalf unless the recipient is a member of a community operating under a community harvest system. The designated hunter must get a designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients, but have no more than two harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time.</P>

              <P>(ii) In the following areas, the taking of wildlife for subsistence uses is prohibited or restricted on public land:</P>
              <P>(A) You may not use firearms, snowmobiles, licensed highway vehicles, or motorized vehicles, except aircraft and boats, in the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area, which consists of those portions of Units 20, 24, 25, and 26 extending 5 miles from each side of the Dalton Highway from the Yukon River to milepost 300 of the Dalton Highway, except as follows: Residents living within the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area may use snowmobiles only for the subsistence taking of wildlife.

However, this does not apply to transportation of a moose hunter or moose part by aircraft between publicly owned airports in the controlled use area or between a publicly owned airport within the area and points outside the area. All hunters on the Koyukuk River passing the ADF&amp;G-operated check station at Ella's Cabin (15 miles upstream from the Yukon on the Koyukuk River) are <PRTPAGE P="760"/>required to stop and report to ADF&amp;G personnel at the check station.</P>
              <P>(iii) You may hunt brown bear by State registration permit in lieu of a resident tag if you have obtained a State registration permit prior to hunting. You may not use aircraft in any manner for brown bear hunting under the authority of a brown bear State registration permit, including transportation of hunters, bears, or parts of bears. However, this prohibition does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Subsistence taking of fish.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) Regulations in this section apply to the taking of fish or their parts for subsistence uses.</P>
              <P>(2) You may take fish for subsistence uses at any time by any method unless you are restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations found in this section. The harvest limit specified in this section for a subsistence season for a species and the State harvest limit set for a State season for the same species are not cumulative, except as modified by regulations in paragraph (e) of this section. This means that if you have taken the harvest limit for a particular species under a subsistence season specified in this section, you may not, after that, take any additional fish of that species under any other harvest limit specified for a State season.</P>
              <P>(3) You may not possess, transport, give, receive, or barter subsistence-taken fish or their parts that have been taken contrary to Federal law or regulation or State law or regulation (unless superseded by regulations in this part).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods, means, and general restrictions.</E> (1) Unless otherwise specified in this section or under terms of a required subsistence fishing permit (as may be modified by regulations in this section), you may use the following legal types of gear for subsistence fishing:</P>
              <P>(i) A set gillnet;</P>
              <P>(ii) A drift gillnet;</P>
              <P>(iii) A purse seine;</P>
              <P>(iv) A hand purse seine;</P>
              <P>(v) A beach seine;</P>
              <P>(vi) Troll gear;</P>
              <P>(vii) A fish wheel;</P>
              <P>(viii) A trawl;</P>
              <P>(ix) A pot;</P>
              <P>(x) A longline;</P>
              <P>(xi) A fyke net;</P>
              <P>(xii) A lead;</P>
              <P>(xiii) A herring pound;</P>
              <P>(xiv) A dip net;</P>
              <P>(xv) Jigging gear;</P>
              <P>(xvi) A mechanical jigging machine;</P>
              <P>(xvii) A handline;</P>
              <P>(xviii) A cast net;<PRTPAGE P="767"/>
              </P>
              <P>(xix) A rod and reel; and</P>
              <P>(xx) A spear.</P>
              <P>(2) You must include an escape mechanism on all pots used to take fish or shellfish. The escape mechanisms are as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) A sidewall, which may include the tunnel, of all shellfish and bottomfish pots must contain an opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches in length, except that in shrimp pots the opening must be a minimum of 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine, no larger than 30 thread. The cotton twine may be knotted at each end only. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The cotton twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars. Dungeness crab pots may have the pot lid tie-down straps secured to the pot at one end by a single loop of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine no larger than 60 thread, or the pot lid must be secured so that, when the twine degrades, the lid will no longer be securely closed.</P>
              <P>(ii) All king crab, Tanner crab, shrimp, miscellaneous shellfish and bottomfish pots may, instead of complying with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, satisfy the following: a sidewall, which may include the tunnel, must contain an opening at least 18 inches in length, except that shrimp pots must contain an opening at least 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of treated or untreated twine, no larger than 36 thread. A galvanic timed-release device, designed to release in no more than 30 days in saltwater, must be integral to the length of twine so that, when the device releases, the twine will no longer secure or obstruct the opening of the pot. The twine may be knotted only at each end and at the attachment points on the galvanic timed-release device. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars.</P>
              <P>(3) For subsistence fishing for salmon, you may not use a gillnet exceeding 50 fathoms in length, unless otherwise specified in this section. The gillnet web must contain at least 30 filaments of equal diameter or at least 6 filaments, each of which must be at least 0.20 millimeter in diameter.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, you may not obstruct more than one-half the width of any stream with any gear used to take fish for subsistence uses.</P>
              <P>(5) You may not use live nonindigenous fish as bait.</P>
              <P>(6) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on the side of your fish wheel facing midstream of the river.</P>
              <P>(7) You may use kegs or buoys of any color but red on any permitted gear, except in the following areas where kegs or buoys of any color, including red, may be used:</P>
              <P>(i) Yukon-Northern Area; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Kuskokwim Area.</P>
