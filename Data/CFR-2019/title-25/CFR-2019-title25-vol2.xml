      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <SUBJECT>How do the regulations in this part carry out the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990?</SUBJECT>

          <P>These regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (18 U.S.C. 1159, 25 U.S.C. 305 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) from false representations, and specify how the Indian Arts and Crafts Board will interpret certain conduct for enforcement purposes. The Act makes it unlawful to offer or display for sale or sell any good in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian, or Indian tribe, or Indian arts and crafts organization resident within the United States.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 309.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>What are the key definitions for purposes of the Act?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Indian</E> as applied to an individual means a person who is a member of an Indian tribe or for purposes of this part is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan (in accordance with the provisions of § 309.4).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Indian artisan</E> means an individual who is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Indian arts and crafts organization</E> means any legally established arts and crafts marketing organization composed of members of Indian tribes.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Indian product</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “Indian product” means any art or craft product made by an Indian. For this purpose, the term “made by an Indian” means that an Indian has provided the artistic or craft work labor necessary to implement an artistic design through a substantial transformation of materials to produce the art or craft work. This may include more than one Indian working together. The labor component of the product, however, must be entirely Indian for the Indian art or craft object to be an “Indian product.”</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Illustrations.</E> The term “Indian product” includes, but is not limited to:</P>
          <P>(i) Art made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;</P>
          <P>(ii) Craft work made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;</P>
          <P>(iii) Handcraft made by an Indian, <E T="03">i.e.</E> an object created with the help of only such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to condition the shape and design of each individual product.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Examples of non-qualifying products.</E> An “Indian product” under the Act does not include any of the following, for example:</P>
          <P>(i) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product made by non-Indian labor;</P>
          <P>(ii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is designed by an Indian but produced by non-Indian labor;</P>
          <P>(iii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is assembled from a kit;</P>
          <P>(iv) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product originating from a commercial product, without substantial transformation provided by Indian artistic or craft work labor;</P>
          <P>(v) Industrial products, which for this purpose are defined as goods that have an exclusively functional purpose, do not serve as a traditional artistic medium, and that do not lend themselves to Indian embellishment, such as appliances and vehicles. An industrial product may not become an Indian product.</P>
          <P>(vi) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is produced in an assembly line or related production line process using multiple workers not all whom are Indians. For example, if twenty people make up the labor to create the product(s), and one person is not Indian, the product is not an “Indian product.”</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Indian tribe</E> means—</P>
          <P>(1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or</P>
          <P>(2) Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Product of a particular Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization</E> means that the origin of a product is identified as a named Indian tribe or <PRTPAGE P="11"/>named Indian arts and crafts organization.</P>

          <SUBJECT>When does a commercial product become an Indian product?</SUBJECT>
          <P>In addressing Indian embellishments to originally commercial products, the Indian labor expended to add art or craft work to those objects must be sufficient to substantially transform the qualities and appearance of the original commercial item. “Commercial products,” under this part, are consumer goods designed for profit and mass distribution that lend themselves to Indian embellishment, for example clothing and accessories. Through substantial transformation due to Indian labor, a product changes from a commercial product to an Indian product. Examples of formerly commercial products that become Indian products include tennis shoes to which an Indian applies beadwork and denim jackets to which an Indian applies ribbon appliqués.</P>

          <P>The Indian Arts and Crafts Act is a truth-in-marketing law. Those who produce and market art and craft work should honestly represent and clarify the degree of Indian involvement in the production of the art and craft work when it is sold, displayed or offered for sale. The following guidelines illustrate the way in which art and craft work may be characterized for marketing purposes and gives examples of products that may be marketed as Indian products.</P>

          <SUBJECT>For marketing purposes, what is the recommended method of identifying authentic Indian products?</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The recommended method of marketing authentic Indian products is to include the name of the artist or artisan, the name of the Tribe in which the artist or artisan is enrolled, and the individual's Tribal enrollment number. If the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan, rather than an enrolled Tribal member, the product identification should include the name of the Tribe providing official written certification that the individual is a non-member Indian artisan and the date upon which such certification was issued by the Tribe. In order for an individual to be certified by an Indian Tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, the individual must be of Indian lineage of one or more members of such Indian Tribe and the certification must be issued in writing by the governing <PRTPAGE P="12"/>body of an Indian Tribe or by a certifying body delegated this function by the governing body of the Indian Tribe.</P>
          <P>(b) For example, the Indian product should include a label, hangtag, provenance card, or similar identification that includes W (name of the artist or artisan), and X (name of the Tribe in which the individual is enrolled) and Y (individual's Tribal enrollment number), or a statement that the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan of Z (name of the Tribe providing certification and the date upon which the certification was issued by the Tribe).</P>

          <P>What constitutes an Indian product is potentially very broad. However, to provide guidance to persons who produce, market, or purchase items marketed as Indian products, §§ 309.11 through 309.22 contain a sample listing of “specific examples” of objects that meet the definition of Indian products. There is some repetition, due to the interrelated nature of many Indian products when made by Indian artistic labor. The lists in these sections contain examples and are not intended to be all-inclusive. Additionally, although the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 and the Indian Arts and Crafts Enforcement Act of 2000 do not address materials used in Indian products, some materials are included for their descriptive nature only. This is not intended to restrict materials used or to exclude materials not listed.</P>

The Notice will be sent by facsimile or mail to the most current address known to the Commission. The Notice will inform the debtor of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount, nature, and basis of the debt;</P>

              <P>(4) The debtor's opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Commission to repay the debt;</P>
              <P>(5) The Commission's policy concerning interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs, as set out in § 513.5, including a statement that such assessments must be made against the debtor unless excused in accordance with the FCCS and this part;</P>

              <P>(a) Interest.</P>

              <P>(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. The Commission will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>

              <P>(c) Administrative costs. The Commission will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result <PRTPAGE P="30"/>of the debtor's failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the cost of providing a copy of the file to the debtor and costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(d) Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue throughout any appeal process.</P>
              <P>(e) Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.</P>
              <P>(f) Additional authority. The Commission may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(g) Waiver. (1) Regardless of the amount of the debt, the Chairman may decide to waive collection of all or part of the accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs if collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Commission's best interest.</P>
              <P>(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, when charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Chairman's decision whether to waive collection of these charges is final and not subject to further review.</P>

              <P>(a) The Commission will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Commission determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Commission will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When may the Commission use salary offset to collect debts?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commission collects debts owed by employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset under the authority of: 5 U.S.C. 5514; 31 U.S.C. 3716; 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; 31 CFR 285.7; and this subpart. Salary offset is applicable when the Commission is attempting to collect a debt owed by an individual employed by the Commission or another agency.</P>
              <P>(b) Nothing in the regulations in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, or the Federal Claims Collection Standards.</P>
              <P>(c) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code takes precedence over a salary offset under this subpart, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d) and 31 U.S.C. 3716.</P>
              <P>(d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly prohibited by another statute.</P>
              <P>(e) This subpart's regulations covering notice, hearing, written responses, and final decisions do not apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) Any routine intra-agency adjustment in pay that is attributable to clerical or administrative error or delay in processing pay documents that have occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, or any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less. However, at the time of any adjustment, or as soon thereafter as possible, the Commission's payroll agency will provide the employee with a written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a contact point for appealing the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(2) Any negative adjustment to pay that arises from the debtor's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four or fewer pay periods. However, at the time of the adjustment, the Commission's payroll agent will provide in the debtor's earnings statement a clear statement informing the debtor of the previous overpayment.</P>
              <P>(f) An employee's involuntary payment of all or any of the debt through salary offset will not be construed as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under the law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.</P>

              <P>(1) Notice that the Commission has reviewed the records relating to the debt and has determined that the employee owes the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) Notice that, after a 30-day period, the Commission will begin to collect the debt by deductions from the employee's current disposable pay account and the date on which deductions from salary will start;</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of the debt and the facts giving rise to it;</P>
              <P>(4) The frequency and the amount of the intended deduction stated as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of pay not to exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay, and the intention to continue the deductions until the debt and all accumulated interest are paid in full or resolved;</P>

              <P>(5) The name, address, and telephone number of the person to whom the debtor may propose a written alternative schedule for voluntary repayment in lieu of salary offset. The debtor must include a justification for the alternative schedule in the proposal;<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) The Commission's policy concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, set out at § 513.5, and a statement that assessments will be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS;</P>
              <P>(7) Notice of the employee's right to inspect and copy all Commission records pertaining to the debt and the name, address, and telephone number of the Commission employee to whom requests for access must be made;</P>
              <P>(8) Notice of the employee's opportunity to a hearing conducted by an individual who does not work for the Commission on the Commission's determination of the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of the repayment schedule;</P>

              <P>(a) To request a hearing, the debtor must file, within 15 days of receiving the Commission's notice of intent to offset, a written petition signed by the debtor and addressed to the Commission stating why the debtor believes the Commission's determination of the existence or amount of the debt is in error. The Commission may waive the 15-day time limit for filing a request for hearing if the employee shows that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his or her control or because the employee did not receive notice of the 15-day time limit. A debtor who has previously obtained a hearing to contest a debt that arose from a notice of violation or proposed civil fine assessment matters under 25 CFR parts 580 through 585 may not re-litigate matters that were at issue in that hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) Regardless of whether the debtor is a Commission employee, the Commission will provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official who is not from the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) The hearing will be conducted according to the FCCS review requirements at 31 CFR 901.3(e).</P>
              <P>(d) Unless the employee requests, and a hearing official grants, a delay in proceedings, within 60 days after the petition for hearing the hearing official will issue a written decision on:</P>
              <P>(1) The determination of the creditor agency concerning the existence or amount of the debt; and</P>
              <P>(2) The repayment schedule, if a schedule was not established by written agreement between the employee and the creditor agency.</P>
              <P>(e) If the hearing official determines that a debt may not be collected by salary offset but the Commission has determined that the debt is valid, the Commission may seek collection of the debt through other means in accordance with applicable law and regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) The form of hearings, written responses, and final decisions will be according to the Commission's review requirements at § 513.7. Written decisions regarding salary offset that are provided after a request for hearing must state: The facts purported to evidence the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the employee's or creditor agency's grounds; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and, where applicable, the repayment schedule.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What opportunity is there for a voluntary repayment agreement when the Commission is the creditor agency?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In response to a Notice of Intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt voluntarily in lieu of salary offset by submitting a written proposed repayment schedule to the Commission. A proposal must be received by the Commission within 15 calendar days after the employee is sent the Notice of Intent.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commission will notify the employee whether, within the Commission's discretion, the proposed repayment schedule is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(c) If the proposed repayment schedule is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 calendar days from the date the notice of the decision is received in which to file a request for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) If the proposed repayment schedule is acceptable or the employee agrees to a modification proposed by the Commission, the agreement will be put in writing and signed by the employee and the Commission.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What special review is available when the Commission is the creditor agency?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by the Commission of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</P>
              <P>(2) The request for special review must include an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a detailed statement, with supporting documents, that shows why the current salary offset or payment results in extreme financial hardship to the employee, spouse, or dependents. The statement must indicate:</P>
              <P>(i) Income from all sources;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assets;</P>
              <P>(iii) Liabilities;</P>
              <P>(iv) Number of dependents;</P>
              <P>(v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;</P>
              <P>(vi) Medical expenses; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commission will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Commission will notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of its determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Commission will provide a new certification to the paying agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Under what conditions will the Commission refund amounts collected by salary offset?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As the creditor agency, the Commission will promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514, when:</P>
              <P>(1) The Commission determines that the debt is not owed; or</P>
              <P>(2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Commission to make a refund.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section will not bear interest.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 513.37</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What will the Commission do as the paying agency?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When the Commission receives a certification from a creditor agency that has complied with the Office of Personnel Management's requirements set out at 5 CFR 550.1109, the Commission will send the employee a written notice of salary offset.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Commission receives an incomplete certification from a creditor agency, the Commission will return the certification with notice that the procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed and a properly certified claim submitted before the Commission will take action to collect the debt from the employee's current pay account.</P>
              <P>(c) Notice to a debtor will include:</P>
              <P>(1) The Commission's receipt of a certification from a creditor agency;</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of the debt and the deductions to be made, which may be stated as a percentage of disposable pay; and</P>

              <P>(3) The date and pay period when the salary offset will begin.<PRTPAGE P="34"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) The Commission will provide a copy of the notice of salary offset to a creditor agency.</P>
              <P>(e) The Commission will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(f) The Commission's payroll officer will determine the amount of the debtor's disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.</P>
              <P>(g) The Commission may use the following types of salary debt collection:</P>
              <P>(1) Lump sum offset. If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump sum offset.</P>
              <P>(2) Installment deductions. The amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the debtor has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will liquidate the debt in three years or less.</P>
              <P>(3) Deductions from final check. A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
              <P>(4) Deductions from other sources. If an employee subject to salary offset is leaving the Commission and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, then the Commission may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards.</P>
              <P>(h) When two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, the Commission's payroll office may, in its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.</P>
              <P>(i) The Commission is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>

            <P>Statements and/or fee payments over ninety (90) calendar days late constitute a failure to pay the annual fee, as set forth in IGRA, 25 U.S.C. 2717(a)(4), and Commission regulations, 25 CFR 573.4(a)(2). In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2717(a)(4), failure to pay fees shall be grounds for revocation of the approval of the Chair of any license, ordinance or resolution required under IGRA for the operation of gaming. In accordance with § 573.4(a)(2) of this chapter, if a tribe, management contractor, or individually owned gaming operation fails to pay the annual fee, the Chair may issue a notice of violation and, simultaneously with or subsequently to the notice of violation, a temporary closure order.</P>

            <P>(b) At any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under subchapter H of this chapter, the Chair and the recipient may agree to settle the notice of late submission, including the amount of the proposed late fee. In the event a settlement is reached, a settlement agreement shall be prepared and executed by the Chair and the recipient.

            <P>(a) The total amount of all fees imposed during any fiscal year shall not exceed the statutory maximum imposed by Congress. The Commission shall credit pro-rata any fees collected in excess of this amount against amounts otherwise due.</P>

            <P>(b) To the extent that revenue derived from fees imposed under the rates of fees established under § 514.2 are not expended or committed at the close of <PRTPAGE P="38"/>any fiscal year, such funds shall remain available until expended to defray the costs of operations of the Commission.</P>

            <P>This part contains the regulations the National Indian Gaming Commission (Commission) follows in implementing the Privacy Act of 1974. These regulations should be read together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The regulations in this part apply to all records contained within systems of records maintained by the Commission that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the Commission. The Commission shall also process all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Commission's FOIA regulations contained in 25 CFR part 517, which gives requesters maximum disclosure.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> Any individual may make a request to the Commission for access to records about him or herself. Such requests shall conform to the requirements of this section.

            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Each request for access to records must describe the records sought in enough detail to enable Commission personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which the records were compiled, any tribal gaming facility with which they were associated, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which the records are kept.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> Requests shall also include a statement indicating the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the requested information.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> When making a request for access to records the individual seeking access must provide verification of identity. The requester must provide a full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The request must be signed and must either be notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, which is a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to assist in the identification and location of requested records, a request may also, at the requester's option, include a social security number.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Verification of guardianship.</E> When making a request as a parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, the request must establish:</P>
            <P>(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, the social security number of the individual;</P>
            <P>(2) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) That the requester is the parent or guardian of the individual and proof of such relationship by providing a birth certificate showing parentage or a court order establishing guardianship; and</P>
            <P>(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Verification in the case of third party information requests.</E> Any individual who desires to have a record covered by this part disclosed to or mailed to another person may designate such person and authorize such person to act as his or her agent for <PRTPAGE P="40"/>that specific purpose. The authorization shall be in writing, signed by the individual whose record is requested, and notarized or witnessed as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">In-person disclosures.</E> An individual to whom a record is to be disclosed in person, pursuant to this section, may have a person of his or her own choosing accompany him or her when the record is disclosed. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the Privacy Act Officer shall inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The Privacy Act Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part access to records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When the Commission receives a request for a record in its possession, the Privacy Act Officer shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act. If the Privacy Act Officer determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the Privacy Act Officer determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall either:</P>
            <P>(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it, or to another agency that originated the record. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> Whenever the Privacy Act Officer refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgement of requests.</E> Upon receipt of a request, the Privacy Act Officer ordinarily shall, within 20 working days, send an acknowledgement letter which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under § 515.9 and provide an assigned request number.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grants of requests for access.</E> Once the Privacy Act Officer makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The notice shall inform the requester of any fee charged under § 515.9 of this part and the Privacy Act Officer shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the Privacy Act Officer will disclose the records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests for access.</E> If the Privacy Act Officer makes any adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. The notification letter shall be signed by the official making the determination and include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and title of the person responsible for the denial;</P>

            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied to the denial;<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
            </P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for amendment or correction of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> An individual may make a request for an amendment or correction to a Commission record about that individual by writing directly to the Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in § 515.3. The request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction that is sought, and state why the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The request may include any documentation that would be helpful to substantiate the reasons for the amendment sought.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Privacy Act Officer response.</E> The Privacy Act Officer shall, not later than 10 working days after receipt of a request for an amendment or correction of a record, acknowledge receipt of the request and provide notification of whether the request is granted or denied. If the request is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall describe the amendment or correction made and shall advise the requester of the right to obtain a copy of the amended or corrected record. If the request is denied in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall send a letter signed by the denying official stating:</P>
            <P>(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and</P>
            <P>(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A requester may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction in the same manner as a denial of a request for access as described in § 515.7. If the appeal is denied, the requester shall be advised of the right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of the right under the Privacy Act for judicial review of the decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Statements of Disagreement.</E> If the appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, the requester has the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states the reason(s) for disagreeing with the Privacy Act Officer's denial of the request for amendment or correction. Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. The Statement of Disagreement shall be placed in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and the record shall be marked to indicate a Statement of Disagreement has been filed.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of amendment, correction, or disagreement.</E> Within 30 working days of the amendment or correction of the record, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, and if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected. If a Statement of Disagreement was filed, the Commission shall append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend the record.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Records not subject to amendment.</E> Section 515.13 lists the records that are exempt from amendment or correction.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 515.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Appeals of initial adverse agency determination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Adverse determination.</E> An initial adverse agency determination of a request may consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that the requested record is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination that a record will not be amended; a determination to deny a request for an accounting; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and any associated denial of a request for expedited treatment under the Commission's FOIA regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If the Privacy Act Officer issues an adverse determination in response to a request, the requester may file a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by the original request, the initial adverse determination that is being appealed, and a statement describing why the adverse determination was in error. The appeal shall be addressed to the Privacy Act Appeals Officer at the locations listed <PRTPAGE P="42"/>in § 515.3 of this part no later than 90 calendar days after the date of the letter denying the request. Both the appeal letter and envelope should be marked “Privacy Act Appeal.” Any Privacy Act appeals submitted via electronic mail should state “Privacy Act Appeal” in the subject line.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The decision on appeal will be made in writing within 20 working days of receipt of the notice of appeal by the Privacy Act Appeals Officer. For good cause shown, however, the Privacy Act Appeals Officer may extend the 20 day working period. If such an extension is taken, the requester shall be promptly notified of such extension and the anticipated date of decision. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the determination, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision. The response to the appeal shall also advise of the right to institute a civil action in a federal district court for judicial review of the decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> In order to institute a civil action in a federal district court for judicial review of an adverse determination, a requester must first appeal it under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for an accounting of record disclosure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> Subject to the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, an individual may make a request for an accounting of the disclosures of any record about that individual that the Commission has made to another person, organization, or agency. The accounting contains the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. The request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made in writing to the Commission's Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in § 515.3.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Where accountings are not required.</E> The Commission is not required to provide an accounting where they relate to:</P>
            <P>(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept, such as those that are made to employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties and disclosures that are made under section 552 of title 5;</P>
            <P>(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Preservation of accountings.</E> All accountings made under this section will be retained for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Court-ordered disclosures.</E> When a record pertaining to an individual is required to be disclosed by a court order, the Privacy Act Officer shall make reasonable efforts to provide notice of this to the individual. Notice shall be given within a reasonable time after the Privacy Act Officer's receipt of the order—except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice shall be given only after the order becomes public. This notice shall be mailed to the individual's last known address and shall contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed. Notice shall not be given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>

No search or review fee may be charged for any record. Additionally, when the Privacy Act Officer makes a copy of a record as a necessary part of reviewing the record or granting access to the record, the Commission shall not charge for the cost of making that copy. Otherwise, the Commission may charge a fee sufficient to cover the cost of duplicating a record.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Specific exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (f):</P>
            <P>(1) Indian Gaming Individuals Records System.</P>
            <P>(2) Management Contract Individuals Record System.</P>
            <P>(b) The exemptions under paragraph (a) of this section apply only to the extent that information in these systems is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). When compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the overall responsibilities of the Commission, with respect to licensing of key employees and primary management officials for employment in an Indian gaming operation or verifying the suitability of an individual who has a financial interest in, or management responsibility for a management contract, the applicable exemption may be waived by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(c) Exemptions from the particular sections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(1) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), because making available the accounting of disclosures to an individual who is the subject of a record could reveal investigative interest. This would permit the individual to take measures to destroy evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid the investigation.</P>
            <P>(2) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(1), and (f) concerning individual access to records, when such access could compromise classified information related to national security, interfere with a pending investigation or internal inquiry, constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or pose a potential threat to the Commission or its employees or to law enforcement personnel. Additionally, access could reveal the identity of a source who provided information under an express promise of confidentiality.</P>
            <P>(3) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), because to require the Commission to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant, or untimely, because of the nature of the information collected and the length of time it is maintained, would create an impossible administrative and investigative burden by continually forcing the Commission to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.</P>
            <P>(4) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) because:</P>
            <P>(i) It is not always possible to determine relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of an investigation.</P>

            <P>(ii) Relevance and necessity are matters of judgment and timing in that what appears relevant and necessary when collected may be deemed unnecessary later. Only after information is assessed can its relevance and necessity be established.<PRTPAGE P="44"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) In any investigation the Commission may receive information concerning violations of law under the jurisdiction of another agency. In the interest of effective law enforcement and under 25 U.S.C. 2716(b), the information could be relevant to an investigation by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(iv) In the interviewing of individuals or obtaining evidence in other ways during an investigation, the Commission could obtain information that may or may not appear relevant at any given time; however, the information could be relevant to another investigation by the Commission.</P>

            <P>This part contains the regulations the National Indian Gaming Commission (Commission) follows in implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These regulations provide procedures by which you may obtain access to records compiled, created, and maintained by the Commission, along with procedures the Commission must follow in response to such requests for records. These regulations should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records maintained by the Commission. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(a), are processed in accordance with the Commission's Privacy Act regulations, 25 CFR part 515, as well as under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial use requester</E> means a requester seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of himself or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category, the FOIA Officer shall determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the FOIA Officer shall contact the requester for additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.<PRTPAGE P="46"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means records or information provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contains material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> mean those expenditures by the Commission actually incurred in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in response to the FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee or employees performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the cost of space, heating, or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a record, or the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of, among other things, paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or electronic records (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> compact discs or USB flash drives). The copies provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary school, an institute of undergraduate higher education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institute of professional education, or an institute of vocational education which operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Freedom of Information Act Officer</E> means the person designated by the Chairman to administer the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is used in paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Record</E> means an agency record that is either created or obtained by an agency and is under agency control at the time of the FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available for purchase by or free distribution to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. For a “freelance journalist” to be regarded as working for a news organization, the requester must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, such as a publication contract. Absent such showing, the requester may provide documentation establishing the requester's past publication record. To qualify for this category, the requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting a news-dissemination function shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Requester</E> means any person, including an individual, Indian tribe, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than a Federal agency, that requests access to records in the possession of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining a record in response to a FOIA request to determine if any portion of that record may be withheld under one or more of the FOIA Exemptions. It also includes processing any record for <PRTPAGE P="47"/>disclosure, for example, redacting information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under § 517.7(c). Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the use of FOIA Exemptions.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Search</E> refers to the time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within a document and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. The FOIA Officer shall ensure that searches are conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity who provides information directly or indirectly to the Commission. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, Indian tribal governments, state governments and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Working day</E> means a Federal workday that does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How to make a FOIA request.</E> Requests for records made pursuant to the FOIA must be in writing. Requests may be mailed, dropped off in person, or faxed to (202) 632-7066 (not a toll free number). Requests that are dropped off in person should be made at 90 K Street NE, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20002 during the hours of 9 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Requests that are mailed should be sent to NIGC Attn: FOIA Officer, 1849 C Street NW, Mail Stop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. Requests may also be sent via electronic mail addressed to <E T="03">FOIARequests@nigc.gov</E> or submitted through the Commission's website.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">First person requests for records.</E> If the requester is making a request for records about himself/herself, the requester must provide verification of identity. Verification requirements are described in 25 CFR 515.3.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for records about another individual.</E> If the requester is making a request for records about another individual, the requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual, a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of the death certificate or a copy of the obituary).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Requests for records shall describe the records requested with as much specificity as possible to enable Commission employees to locate the information requested with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should describe the subject matter of the records sought, the time periods in which the records were generated, and any tribe or tribal gaming facility with which they were associated. Before submitting a request, requesters may contact the Commission's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records being sought and receive assistance describing the records. If after receiving a request the FOIA Officer determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA Officer must inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the Commission's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> Requests shall also include a statement indicating the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the requested information, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees. If the requester is requesting a waiver or reduction of fees the requester must include justification for such waiver or reduction (see § 517.9(c) for more information). If the request for a fee waiver is denied, the requester will be notified of this decision and advised that fees associated with the processing of the request will be assessed. The requester must send an acknowledgment to the <PRTPAGE P="48"/>FOIA Officer indicating his/her willingness to pay the fees. Absent such acknowledgment within the specified time frame, the request will be considered incomplete, no further work shall be done, and the request will be administratively closed.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Form or format of records requested.</E> Requesters may specify their preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. The Commission will accommodate such requests where the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Types of records not available.</E> The FOIA does not require the Commission to:</P>
            <P>(1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or</P>
            <P>(3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the FOIA Officer must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The FOIA Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part a request for records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Granting of requests.</E> When the FOIA Officer determines that the requested records shall be made available, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester in writing and provide copies of the requested records in whole or in part. Records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated to show the exemption applied to the withheld information and the amount of information withheld unless to do so would harm the interest protected by an applicable exemption. If a requested record contains exempted material along with nonexempt material, all reasonable segregable material shall be disclosed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Adverse Determinations.</E> If the FOIA Officer makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify the requester of that adverse determination in writing. Adverse determinations include decisions that: The requested record is exempt from release, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; denials involving fees or fee waiver matters; and denials of requests for expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Content of adverse determination.</E> Any adverse determination issued by the FOIA Officer must include:</P>
            <P>(1) A brief statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying access to a record unless to do so would harm the interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
            <P>(2) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
            <P>(3) A statement that the adverse determination may be appealed under § 517.8 of this part and a description of the appeal requirements; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Consultation, referral, and coordination.</E> When reviewing records located in response to a request, the FOIA Officer will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any record determined to be better suited for review by another <PRTPAGE P="49"/>Federal Government agency, the FOIA Officer must proceed in one of the following ways.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originating with the Commission contain information of interest to another Federal Government agency, the FOIA Officer should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (i) When the FOIA Officer believes that a different Federal Government agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the FOIA Officer should typically refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. If the Commission and another Federal Government agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.</P>
            <P>(ii) Whenever the FOIA Officer refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, he or she must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral.</P>
            <P>(iii) After the FOIA Officer refers a record to another Federal Government agency, the agency receiving the referral shall make a disclosure determination and respond directly to the requester. The referral of a record is not an adverse determination and no appeal rights accrue to the requester by this act.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy interests. For example, if the FOIA Officer in responding to a request for records on a living third party locates records originating with a criminal law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the FOIA Officer should coordinate with the originating agency to obtain its views on whether the record may be disclosed. The FOIA Officer should then convey the determination as to whether the record will be released to the requester.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 517.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The FOIA Officer ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt. All statutory and regulatory timelines will commence on the date that the request is received by the Commission's Headquarters FOIA Office that is designated to receive requests in § 517.4(a). In instances of requests misdirected to Commission field offices, the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the Commission's Headquarters FOIA Office, but in any event no later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any Commission office.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> (1) The FOIA Officer may use multi-track processing in responding to requests. Multi-track processing means placing simple requests requiring rather limited review in one processing track and placing more voluminous and complex requests in one or more other tracks. Requests in either track are processed on a first-in/first-out basis.</P>

            <P>(2) The FOIA Officer may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of faster track(s). The FOIA Officer will do so either by contacting the requester by letter, telephone, electronic mail, or facsimile whichever is more efficient in each case. When providing a requester with the opportunity to limit the scope of their request, the FOIA Officer shall also advise the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any dispute arising between the requester and the Commission as well as the requester's right to seek <PRTPAGE P="50"/>dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial determinations.</E> (1) The FOIA Officer shall make an initial determination regarding access to the requested information and notify the requester within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the request. This 20 day period may be extended if unusual circumstances arise. If an extension is necessary, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the extension, briefly stating the reasons for the extension, and estimating when the FOIA Officer will respond. Unusual circumstances warranting extension are:</P>
            <P>(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The need for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, which consultation shall be conducted with all practicable speed.</P>
            <P>(2) If the FOIA Officer decides that an initial determination cannot be reached within the time limits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the reasons for the delay and include an estimate of when a determination will be made. The requester will then have the opportunity to modify the request or arrange for an alternative time frame for completion of the request. To assist in this process, the FOIA Officer shall advise the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the Commission, and notify the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
            <P>(3) If no initial determination has been made at the end of the 20 day period provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including any extension, the requester may appeal the action to the FOIA Appeals Officer.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing of request.</E> (1) A requester may make a request for expedited processing at any time.</P>
            <P>(2) When a request for expedited processing is received, the FOIA Officer must determine whether to grant the request for expedited processing within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt. Requests will receive expedited processing if one of the following compelling needs is met:</P>
            <P>(i) The requester can establish that failure to receive the records quickly could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information and can demonstrate that an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity exists.</P>
            <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. As a matter of administrative discretion, the FOIA Officer may waive the formal certification requirement.</P>
            <P>(4) Administrative appeals of denials of expedited processing will be given expeditious consideration. If the denial of expedited processing is upheld by the FOIA Appeals Officer, that decision is immediately subject to judicial review in the appropriate Federal district court.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Confidential commercial information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> The FOIA Officer shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter who provides confidential commercial information to the Commission, with prompt notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing the confidential commercial information if the Commission may be required to disclose the information under the FOIA. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the confidential commercial information. The FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that notice and opportunity to object has been given to the submitter.<PRTPAGE P="51"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Where notice is required.</E> Notice shall be given to a submitter when:</P>
            <P>(1) The information has been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure. Submitters of confidential commercial information shall use good faith efforts to designate, either at the time of submission or a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions they deem protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Such designation shall be deemed to have expired ten years after the date of submission, unless the requester provides reasonable justification for a designation period of greater duration; or</P>
            <P>(2) The FOIA Officer has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Where notice is discretionary.</E> If the FOIA Officer has reason to believe that information submitted to the Commission may be protected from disclosure under any other exemption of the FOIA, the FOIA Officer may, in his or her discretion, provide the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to the release of that information.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> The FOIA Officer shall afford a submitter a reasonable period of time to provide the FOIA Officer with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA, and if Exemption 4 applies, shall demonstrate the reasons the submitter believes the information to be confidential commercial information that is exempt from disclosure. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter. In the event a submitter fails to respond to the notice in the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is received after the disclosure decision has been made will not be considered. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The FOIA Officer shall carefully consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the information requested. Whenever the FOIA Officer determines that disclosure is appropriate, the FOIA Officer shall, within a reasonable number of days prior to disclosure, provide the submitter with written notice of the intent to disclose which shall include a statement of the reasons for which the submitter's objections were overruled, a description of the information to be disclosed, and a specific disclosure date. The FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that the requested records will be made available.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of lawsuit.</E> If the requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the submitter of this action. If a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Exceptions to the notice requirements under this section.</E> The notice requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be disclosed pursuant to Exemption 4 and/or any other exemption of the FOIA;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than the FOIA);</P>
            <P>(4) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with this part, when the submitter had the opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or</P>

            <P>(5) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with this part appears obviously frivolous. When the <PRTPAGE P="52"/>FOIA Officer determines that a submitter was frivolous in designating information as confidential, the FOIA Officer must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date, but no opportunity to object to disclosure will be offered.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Right of appeal.</E> The requester has the right to appeal to the FOIA Appeals Officer any adverse determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of Appeal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Time for appeal.</E> To be considered timely, an appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the response or after the time limit for response by the FOIA Officer has expired. Prior to submitting an appeal any outstanding fees associated with FOIA requests must be paid in full.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of appeal.</E> An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the original request and adverse determination. To expedite the appellate process and give the requester an opportunity to present his/her arguments, the notice should contain a brief statement of the reasons why the requester believes the adverse determination to have been in error. Requesters may submit appeals by mail, facsimile, or electronically. Appeals sent by mail shall be addressed to the National Indian Gaming Commission, Attn: FOIA Appeals Officer, 1849 C Street NW, Mailstop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. Appeals may also be submitted via electronic mail at <E T="03">FOIARequests@nigc.gov</E> or through the NIGC's website. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Final agency determinations.</E> The FOIA Appeals Officer shall issue a final written determination, stating the basis for its decision, within twenty (20) working days after receipt of a notice of appeal. If the determination is to provide access to the requested records, the FOIA Officer shall make those records immediately available to the requester. If the determination upholds the adverse determination, the FOIA Appeals Officer shall notify the requester of the determination, the ability to obtain mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, and the right to obtain judicial review in the appropriate Federal district court.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> Before seeking review by a court of the FOIA Officer's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Fees pursuant to the FOIA shall be assessed according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for services rendered by the Commission in response to requests for records under this part. All fees shall be charged to the requester, except where the charging of fees is limited under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (c) of this section. Payment of fees should be by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Charges for responding to FOIA requests.</E> The following fees shall be assessed in responding to requests for records submitted under this part, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> The FOIA Officer will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where he or she can readily reproduce the record in the form or format requested. When photocopies are supplied, the FOIA Officer shall charge $0.15 per page for copies of documents up to 8<FR>1/2</FR> x 14. For copies of records produced on tapes, compact discs, or other media, the FOIA Officer shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning <PRTPAGE P="53"/>those materials. For other methods of reproduction, the FOIA Officer shall charge the actual direct costs of producing the documents.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Searches</E>—(i) <E T="03">Manual searches.</E> Whenever feasible, the FOIA Officer will charge at the salary rate (basic pay plus 16% percent for benefits) of the employee or employees performing the search. However, where a homogenous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> all administrative/clerical or all professional/executive), the FOIA Officer shall charge $4.45 per quarter hour for clerical time and $7.75 per quarter hour for professional time. Charges for search time less than a full hour will be in increments of quarter hours.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Computer searches.</E> The FOIA Officer will charge the actual direct costs of conducting computer searches. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for requested records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. For requests that require the creation of a new computer program to locate requested records, the Commission will charge the direct costs associated with such program's creation. The FOIA Officer must notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review fees.</E> Review fees shall be assessed only with respect to those requesters who seek records for a commercial use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed at the same rates as those listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record review, for example, review undertaken when the FOIA Officer analyzes the applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or portion thereof at the initial request level. No charge shall be assessed at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Statutory waiver.</E> Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge below that listed in paragraph (b) of this section where it is determined, based upon information provided by a requester or otherwise made known to the FOIA Officer, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. Disclosure is in the public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and is not primarily for commercial purposes. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case by case basis. In order to determine whether the fee waiver requirement is met, the FOIA Officer shall consider the following six factors:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">The subject of the request.</E> Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">The informative value of the information to be disclosed.</E> Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure.</E> Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding;</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">The significance of the contribution to public understanding.</E> Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">The existence and magnitude of commercial interest.</E> Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">The primary interest in disclosure.</E> Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Types of requesters.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutional requesters; representative of the news media; and all other requesters. These terms are defined in § 517.3. The following specific levels of fees are prescribed for each of these categories:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> The FOIA Officer shall charge commercial <PRTPAGE P="54"/>use requesters the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institutions requesters.</E> The FOIA Officer shall charge educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters for document duplication only, except that the first 100 pages of copies shall be provided without charge.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">News media requesters.</E> The FOIA Officer shall charge news media requesters for document duplication costs only, except that the first 100 pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The FOIA Officer shall charge requesters who do not fall into any of the categories in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section fees which cover the full reasonable direct costs incurred for searching for and reproducing records if that total costs exceeds $15.00, except that the first 100 pages and the first two hours of manual search time shall not be charged. To apply this term to computer searches, the FOIA Officer shall determine the total hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's salary (plus 16 percent for benefits). When the cost of the search equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, the FOIA Officer will begin assessing charges for the computer search.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) Ordinarily, no charges will be assessed when requested records are not found or when records located are withheld as exempt. However, if the requester has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld as exempt, fees may be charged.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Commission fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits for responding to a request, it may not charge search fees or, in cases where records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)-(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and provides timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, then a failure to comply with the statutory time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, then the Commission may charge search fees and duplication fees, where applicable, if the following steps are taken. The FOIA Officer must:</P>
            <P>(A) Provide timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and</P>
            <P>(B) Discuss with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).</P>
            <P>(iii) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, then a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges for interest.</E> The FOIA Officer may assess interest charges on an unpaid bill, accrued under previous FOIA request(s), starting the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent to you. A fee received by the FOIA Officer, even if not processed will result in a stay of the accrual of interest. The Commission shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, its implementing procedures, and the Commission's debt collection regulations located in 25 CFR part 513 to recover any indebtedness owed to the Commission.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> The requester or a group of requesters may not submit multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to evade an assessment of fees, the FOIA Officer may aggregate such request and charge accordingly.<PRTPAGE P="55"/>
            </P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E> Fees may be paid upon provision of the requested records, except that payment may be required prior to that time if the requester has previously failed to pay fees or if the FOIA Officer determines that total fee will exceed $250.00. When payment is required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits prescribed in § 517.6 shall not be deemed to begin until the FOIA Officer has received payment of the assessed fee.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> Where it is anticipated that the cost of providing the requested record will exceed $25.00 after the free duplication and search time has been calculated, and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee greater than $25.00, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the amount of the anticipated fee or a portion thereof, which can readily be estimated. The notification shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with agency representatives for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a reduced cost.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of tier.</E> (1) The determination of tier level shall be made based upon the annual gross gaming revenues indicated within the gaming operation's audited financial statements. Gaming operations moving from one tier to another shall have nine (9) months from the date of the independent certified public accountant's audit report to achieve compliance with the requirements of the new tier.</P>

However, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority may extend the deadline by an additional six (6) months if written notice is provided to the Commission no later than two weeks before the expiration of the nine (9) month period.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Gaming operations.</E> Each gaming operation shall develop and implement an internal control system that, at a minimum, complies with the tribal internal control standards.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Existing gaming operations.</E> All gaming operations that are operating on or before June 27, 2002, shall comply with this part within the time requirements established in paragraph (c) of this section.

            <P>(2) <E T="03">New gaming operations.</E> All gaming operations that commence operations after August 26, 2002, shall comply with this part before commencement of operations.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Submission to Commission.</E> Tribal regulations promulgated pursuant to this part shall not be required to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to 25 CFR 522.3(b).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">CPA testing.</E> (1) An independent certified public accountant (CPA) shall be engaged to perform “Agreed-Upon Procedures” to verify that the gaming operation is in compliance with the minimum internal control standards (MICS) set forth in this part or a Tribally approved variance thereto that has received Commission concurrence. The CPA shall report each event and procedure discovered by or brought to the CPA's attention that the CPA believes does not satisfy the minimum standards or Tribally approved variance that has received Commission concurrence. The “Agreed-Upon Procedures” may be performed in conjunction with the annual audit. The CPA shall report its findings to the Tribe, Tribal gaming regulatory authority, and management. The Tribe shall submit two copies of the report to the Commission within 120 days of the gaming operation's fiscal year end. This regulation is intended to communicate the Commission's position on the minimum agreed-upon procedures to be performed by the CPA. Throughout these regulations, the CPA's engagement and reporting are based on Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs) in effect as of December 31, 2003, specifically SSAE 10 (“Revision and Recodification Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements.”). If future revisions are made to the SSAEs or new SSAEs are adopted that are applicable to this type of engagement, the CPA is to comply with any new or revised professional standards in conducting engagements pursuant to these regulations and the issuance of the agreed-upon procedures report. The CPA shall perform the “Agreed-Upon Procedures” in accordance with the following:</P>
            <P>(i) As a prerequisite to the evaluation of the gaming operation's internal control systems, it is recommended that the CPA obtain and review an organization chart depicting segregation of functions and responsibilities, a description of the duties and responsibilities of each position shown on the organization chart, and an accurate, detailed narrative description of the gaming operation's procedures in effect that demonstrate compliance.</P>

            <P>(ii) Complete the CPA NIGC MICS Compliance checklists or other comparable testing procedures. The checklists should measure compliance on a sampling basis by performing walk-throughs, observations and substantive testing. The CPA shall complete separate checklists for each gaming revenue center, cage and credit, internal <PRTPAGE P="80"/>audit, surveillance, information technology and complimentary services or items. All questions on each applicable checklist should be completed. Work-paper references are suggested for all “no” responses for the results obtained during testing (unless a note in the “W/P Ref” can explain the exception).</P>
            <P>(iii) The CPA shall perform, at a minimum, the following procedures in conjunction with the completion of the checklists:</P>
            <P>(A) At least one unannounced observation of each of the following: Gaming machine coin drop, gaming machine currency acceptor drop, table games drop, gaming machine coin count, gaming machine currency acceptor count, and table games count. The AICPA's “Audits of Casinos” Audit and Accounting Guide states that “observations of operations in the casino cage and count room should not be announced in advance * * *” For purposes of these procedures, “unannounced” means that no officers, directors, or employees are given advance information regarding the dates or times of such observations. The independent accountant should make arrangements with the gaming operation and Tribal gaming regulatory authority to ensure proper identification of the CPA's personnel and to provide for their prompt access to the count rooms.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The gaming machine coin count observation would include a weigh scale test of all denominations using pre-counted coin. The count would be in process when these tests are performed, and would be conducted prior to the commencement of any other walk-through procedures. For computerized weigh scales, the test can be conducted at the conclusion of the count, but before the final totals are generated.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The checklists should provide for drop/count observations, inclusive of hard drop/count, soft drop/count and currency acceptor drop/count. The count room would not be entered until the count is in process and the CPA would not leave the room until the monies have been counted and verified to the count sheet by the CPA and accepted into accountability. If the drop teams are unaware of the drop observations and the count observations would be unexpected, the hard count and soft count rooms may be entered simultaneously. Additionally, if the gaming machine currency acceptor count begins immediately after the table games count in the same location, by the same count team, and using the same equipment, the currency acceptor count observation can be conducted on the same day as the table games count observation, provided the CPA remains until monies are transferred to the vault/cashier.</P>
            <P>(B) Observations of the gaming operation's employees as they perform their duties.</P>
            <P>(C) Interviews with the gaming operation's employees who perform the relevant procedures.</P>
            <P>(D) Compliance testing of various documents relevant to the procedures. The scope of such testing should be indicated on the checklist where applicable.</P>
            <P>(E) For new gaming operations that have been in operation for three months or less at the end of their business year, performance of this regulation, section 542.3(f), is not required for the partial period.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Alternatively, at the discretion of the Tribe, the Tribe may engage an independent certified public accountant (CPA) to perform the testing, observations and procedures reflected in paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section utilizing the Tribal internal control standards adopted by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or Tribally approved variance that has received Commission concurrence. Accordingly, the CPA will verify compliance by the gaming operation with the Tribal internal control standards. Should the Tribe elect this alternative, as a prerequisite, the CPA will perform the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The CPA shall compare the Tribal internal control standards to the MICS to ascertain whether the criteria set forth in the MICS or Commission approved variances are adequately addressed.</P>

            <P>(ii) The CPA may utilize personnel of the Tribal gaming regulatory authority to cross-reference the Tribal internal control standards to the MICS, provided the CPA performs a review of the Tribal gaming regulatory authority <PRTPAGE P="81"/>personnel's work and assumes complete responsibility for the proper completion of the work product.</P>
            <P>(iii) The CPA shall report each procedure discovered by or brought to the CPA's attention that the CPA believes does not satisfy paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reliance on Internal Auditors.</E> (i) The CPA may rely on the work of an internal auditor, to the extent allowed by the professional standards, for the performance of the recommended procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, and for the completion of the checklists as they relate to the procedures covered therein provided that the internal audit department can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the CPA that the requirements contained within § 542.22, 542.32, or 542.42, as applicable, have been satisfied.</P>
            <P>(ii) Agreed-upon procedures are to be performed by the CPA to determine that the internal audit procedures performed for a past 12-month period (includes two 6-month periods) encompassing a portion or all of the most recent business year has been properly completed. The CPA will apply the following Agreed-Upon Procedures to the gaming operation's written assertion:</P>
            <P>(A) Obtain internal audit department work-papers completed for a 12-month period (includes two 6-month periods) encompassing a portion or all of the most recent business year and determine whether the CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures were included in the internal audit work-papers and all steps described in the checklists were initialed or signed by an internal audit representative.</P>
            <P>(B) For the internal audit work-papers obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, on a sample basis, reperform the procedures included in CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures prepared by internal audit and determine if all instances of noncompliance noted in the sample were documented as such by internal audit. The CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures for the applicable Drop and Count procedures are not included in the sample reperformance of procedures because the CPA is required to perform the drop and count observations as required under paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(A) of this section of the Agreed-Upon Procedures. The CPA's sample should comprise a minimum of 3 percent of the procedures required in each CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklist or other comparable testing procedures for the gaming machine and table game departments and 5 percent for the other departments completed by internal audit in compliance with the internal audit MICS. The reperformance of procedures is performed as follows:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For inquiries, the CPA should either speak with the same individual or an individual of the same job position as the internal auditor did for the procedure indicated in their checklist.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For observations, the CPA should observe the same process as the internal auditor did for the procedure as indicated in their checklist.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For document testing, the CPA should look at the same original document as tested by the internal auditor for the procedure as indicated in their checklist. The CPA need only retest the minimum sample size required in the checklist.</P>
            <P>(C) The CPA is to investigate and resolve any differences between their reperformance results and the internal audit results.</P>
            <P>(D) Documentation is maintained for 5 years by the CPA indicating the procedures reperformed along with the results.</P>
            <P>(E) When performing the procedures for paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section in subsequent years, the CPA must select a different sample so that the CPA will reperform substantially all of the procedures after several years.</P>
            <P>(F) Any additional procedures performed at the request of the Commission, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or management should be included in the Agreed-Upon Procedures report transmitted to the Commission.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Report Format.</E> (i) The NIGC has concluded that the performance of these procedures is an attestation engagement in which the CPA applies such Agreed-Upon Procedures to the gaming operation's assertion that it is <PRTPAGE P="82"/>in compliance with the MICS and, if applicable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Tribal internal control standards and approved variances, provide a level of control that equals or exceeds that of the MICS. Accordingly, the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE's), specifically SSAE 10, issued by the Auditing Standards Board is currently applicable. SSAE 10 provides current, pertinent guidance regarding agreed-upon procedure engagements, and the sample report formats included within those standards should be used, as appropriate, in the preparation of the CPA's agreed-upon procedures report. If future revisions are made to this standard or new SSAEs are adopted that are applicable to this type of engagement, the CPA is to comply with any revised professional standards in issuing their agreed upon procedures report. The Commission will provide an Example Report and Letter Formats upon request that may be used and contain all of the information discussed below:</P>
            <P>(A) The report must describe all instances of procedural noncompliance regardless of materiality) with the MICS or approved variations, and all instances where the Tribal gaming regulatory authority's regulations do not comply with the MICS. When describing the agreed-upon procedures performed, the CPA should also indicate whether procedures performed by other individuals were utilized to substitute for the procedures required to be performed by the CPA. For each instance of noncompliance noted in the CPA's agreed-upon procedures report, the following information must be included:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The citation of the applicable MICS for which the instance of noncompliance was noted.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A narrative description of the noncompliance, including the number of exceptions and sample size tested.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Report Submission Requirements.</E> (i) The CPA shall prepare a report of the findings for the Tribe and management. The Tribe shall submit 2 copies of the report to the Commission no later than 120 days after the gaming operation's business year. This report should be provided in addition to any other reports required to be submitted to the Commission.</P>
            <P>(ii) The CPA should maintain the work-papers supporting the report for a minimum of five years. Digital storage is acceptable. The Commission may request access to these work-papers, through the Tribe.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists.</E> In connection with the CPA testing pursuant to this section and as referenced therein, the Commission will provide CPA MICS Compliance Checklists upon request.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Enforcement of Commission Minimum Internal Control Standards.</E> (1) Each Tribal gaming regulatory authority is required to establish and implement internal control standards pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Each gaming operation is then required, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, to develop and implement an internal control system that complies with the Tribal internal control standards. Failure to do so may subject the Tribal operator of the gaming operation, and/or the management contractor, to penalties under 25 U.S.C. 2713.</P>
            <P>(2) Recognizing that Tribes are the primary regulator of their gaming operation(s), enforcement action by the Commission will not be initiated under this part without first informing the Tribe and Tribal gaming regulatory authority of deficiencies in the internal controls of its gaming operation and allowing a reasonable period of time to address such deficiencies. Such prior notice and opportunity for corrective action is not required where the threat to the integrity of the gaming operation is immediate and severe.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Tribal gaming regulatory authority approval.</E> (1) A Tribal gaming regulatory authority may approve a variance for a gaming operation if it has determined that the variance will achieve a level of control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace.</P>
            <P>(2) For each enumerated standard for which the Tribal gaming regulatory authority approves a variance, it shall submit to the Chairman of the NIGC, within thirty (30) days, a detailed report, which shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A detailed description of the variance;</P>
            <P>(ii) An explanation of how the variance achieves a level of control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Evidence that the Tribal gaming regulatory authority has approved the variance.</P>

            <P>(3) In the event that the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or the Tribe chooses to submit a variance request directly to the Chairman, it may do so without the approval requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and such request shall be deemed <PRTPAGE P="110"/>as having been approved by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Review by the Chairman.</E> (1) Following receipt of the variance approval, the Chairman or his or her designee shall have sixty (60) days to concur with or object to the approval of the variance.</P>
            <P>(2) Any objection raised by the Chairman shall be in the form of a written explanation based upon the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) There is no valid explanation of why the gaming operation should have received a variance approval from the Tribal gaming regulatory authority on the enumerated standard; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The variance as approved by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority does not provide a level of control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Chairman fails to object in writing within sixty (60) days after the date of receipt of a complete submission, the variance shall be considered concurred with by the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(4) The 60-day deadline may be extended, provided such extension is mutually agreed upon by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority and the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Curing Chairman's objections.</E> (1) Following an objection by the Chairman to the issuance of a variance, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority shall have the opportunity to cure any objections noted by the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(2) A Tribal gaming regulatory authority may cure the objections raised by the Chairman by:</P>
            <P>(i) Rescinding its initial approval of the variance; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Rescinding its initial approval, revising the variance, approving it, and re-submitting it to the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon any re-submission of a variance approval, the Chairman shall have thirty (30) days to concur with or object to the re-submitted variance.</P>
            <P>(4) If the Chairman fails to object in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of the re-submitted variance, the re-submitted variance shall be considered concurred with by the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(5) The thirty (30) day deadline may be extended, provided such extension is mutually agreed upon by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority and the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> (1) Upon receipt of objections to a re-submission of a variance, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority shall be entitled to an appeal to the full Commission in accordance with the following process:</P>
            <P>(i) Within thirty (30) days of receiving an objection to a re-submission, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority shall file its notice of appeal.</P>
            <P>(ii) Failure to file an appeal within the time provided by this section shall result in a waiver of the opportunity for an appeal.</P>
            <P>(iii) An appeal under this section shall specify the reasons why the Tribal gaming regulatory authority believes the Chairman's objections should be reviewed, and shall include supporting documentation, if any.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Tribal gaming regulatory authority shall be provided with any comments offered by the Chairman to the Commission on the substance of the appeal by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority and shall be offered the opportunity to respond to any such comments.</P>
            <P>(v) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the appeal, the Commission shall render a decision based upon the criteria contained within paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless the Tribal gaming regulatory authority elects to wave the thirty (30) day requirement and to provide the Commission additional time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, to render a decision.</P>
            <P>(vi) In the absence of a decision within the time provided, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority's resubmission shall be considered concurred with by the Commission and become effective.</P>

            <P>(2) The Tribal gaming regulatory authority may appeal the Chairman's objection to the approval of a variance to the full Commission without resubmitting the variance by filling a notice of appeal with the full Commission within thirty (30) days of the Chairman's objection and complying with the procedures described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="111"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effective date of variance.</E> The gaming operation shall comply with standards that achieve a level of control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace until such time as the Commission objects to the Tribal gaming regulatory authority's approval of a variance as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Concurrence in a variance by the Chairman or Commission is discretionary and variances will not be granted routinely. The gaming operation shall comply with standards at least as stringent as those set forth in this part until such time as the Chairman or Commission concurs with the Tribal gaming regulatory authority's approval of a variance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the minimum internal control standards for accounting?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each gaming operation shall prepare accurate, complete, legible, and permanent records of all transactions pertaining to revenue and gaming activities.</P>
            <P>(b) Each gaming operation shall prepare general accounting records according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles on a double-entry system of accounting, maintaining detailed, supporting, subsidiary records, including, but not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Detailed records identifying revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity for each gaming operation;</P>
            <P>(2) Detailed records of all markers, IOU's, returned checks, hold checks, or other similar credit instruments;</P>
            <P>(3) Individual and statistical game records to reflect statistical drop, statistical win, and the percentage of statistical win to statistical drop by each table game, and to reflect statistical drop, statistical win, and the percentage of statistical win to statistical drop for each type of table game, by shift, by day, cumulative month-to-date and year-to-date, and individual and statistical game records reflecting similar information for all other games;</P>
            <P>(4) Gaming machine analysis reports which, by each machine, compare actual hold percentages to theoretical hold percentages;</P>
            <P>(5) The records required by this part and by the Tribal internal control standards;</P>
            <P>(6) Journal entries prepared by the gaming operation and by its independent accountants; and</P>
            <P>(7) Any other records specifically required to be maintained.</P>
            <P>(c) Each gaming operation shall establish administrative and accounting procedures for the purpose of determining effective control over a gaming operation's fiscal affairs. The procedures shall be designed to reasonably ensure that:</P>
            <P>(1) Assets are safeguarded;</P>
            <P>(2) Financial records are accurate and reliable;</P>
            <P>(3) Transactions are performed only in accordance with management's general and specific authorization;</P>
            <P>(4) Transactions are recorded adequately to permit proper reporting of gaming revenue and of fees and taxes, and to maintain accountability of assets;</P>
            <P>(5) Recorded accountability for assets is compared with actual assets at reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is taken with respect to any discrepancies; and</P>
            <P>(6) Functions, duties, and responsibilities are appropriately segregated in accordance with sound business practices.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Gross gaming revenue computations.</E> (1) For table games, gross revenue equals the closing table bankroll, plus credit slips for cash, chips, tokens or personal/payroll checks returned to the cage, plus drop, less opening table bankroll and fills to the table, and money transfers issued from the game through the use of a cashless wagering system.</P>
            <P>(2) For gaming machines, gross revenue equals drop, less fills, jackpot payouts and personal property awarded to patrons as gambling winnings. Additionally, the initial hopper load is not a fill and does not affect gross revenue. The difference between the initial hopper load and the total amount that is in the hopper at the end of the gaming operation's fiscal year should be adjusted accordingly as an addition to or subtraction from the drop for the year.</P>
            <P>(3) For each counter game, gross revenue equals:<PRTPAGE P="112"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The money accepted by the gaming operation on events or games that occur during the month or will occur in subsequent months, less money paid out during the month to patrons on winning wagers (“cash basis”); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The money accepted by the gaming operation on events or games that occur during the month, plus money, not previously included in gross revenue, that was accepted by the gaming operation in previous months on events or games occurring in the month, less money paid out during the month to patrons as winning wagers (“modified accrual basis”).</P>
            <P>(4) For each card game and any other game in which the gaming operation is not a party to a wager, gross revenue equals all money received by the operation as compensation for conducting the game.</P>
            <P>(i) A gaming operation shall not include either shill win or loss in gross revenue computations.</P>
            <P>(ii) In computing gross revenue for gaming machines, keno and bingo, the actual cost to the gaming operation of any personal property distributed as losses to patrons may be deducted from winnings (other than costs of travel, lodging, services, food, and beverages), if the gaming operation maintains detailed documents supporting the deduction.</P>
            <P>(e) Each gaming operation shall establish internal control systems sufficient to ensure that currency (other than tips or gratuities) received from a patron in the gaming area is promptly placed in a locked box in the table, or, in the case of a cashier, in the appropriate place in the cashier's cage, or on those games which do not have a locked drop box, or on card game tables, in an appropriate place on the table, in the cash register or in another approved repository.</P>
            <P>(f) If the gaming operation provides periodic payments to satisfy a payout resulting from a wager, the initial installment payment, when paid, and the actual cost of a payment plan, which is funded by the gaming operation, may be deducted from winnings. The gaming operation is required to obtain the approval of all payment plans from the TGRA. For any funding method which merely guarantees the gaming operation's performance, and under which the gaming operation makes payments out of cash flow (e.g. irrevocable letters of credits, surety bonds, or other similar methods), the gaming operation may only deduct such payments when paid to the patron.</P>
            <P>(g) For payouts by wide-area progressive gaming machine systems, a gaming operation may deduct from winnings only its pro rata share of a wide-area gaming machine system payout.</P>
            <P>(h) Cash-out tickets issued at a gaming machine or gaming device shall be deducted from gross revenue as jackpot payouts in the month the tickets are issued by the gaming machine or gaming device. Tickets deducted from gross revenue that are not redeemed within a period, not to exceed 180 days of issuance, shall be included in gross revenue. An unredeemed ticket previously included in gross revenue may be deducted from gross revenue in the month redeemed.</P>
            <P>(i) A gaming operation may not deduct from gross revenues the unpaid balance of a credit instrument extended for purposes other than gaming.</P>
            <P>(j) A gaming operation may deduct from gross revenue the unpaid balance of a credit instrument if the gaming operation documents, or otherwise keeps detailed records of, compliance with the following requirements. Such records confirming compliance shall be made available to the TGRA or the Commission upon request:</P>
            <P>(1) The gaming operation can document that the credit extended was for gaming purposes;</P>
            <P>(2) The gaming operation has established procedures and relevant criteria to evaluate a patron's credit reputation or financial resources and to then determine that there is a reasonable basis for extending credit in the amount or sum placed at the patron's disposal;</P>

            <P>(3) In the case of personal checks, the gaming operation has established procedures to examine documentation, which would normally be acceptable as a type of identification when cashing checks, and has recorded the patron's bank check guarantee card number or credit card number, or has satisfied <PRTPAGE P="113"/>paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as management may deem appropriate for the check-cashing authorization granted;</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of third-party checks for which cash, chips, or tokens have been issued to the patron, or which were accepted in payment of another credit instrument, the gaming operation has established procedures to examine documentation, normally accepted as a means of identification when cashing checks, and has, for the check's maker or drawer, satisfied paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as management may deem appropriate for the check-cashing authorization granted;</P>
            <P>(5) In the case of guaranteed drafts, procedures should be established to ensure compliance with the issuance and acceptance procedures prescribed by the issuer;</P>
            <P>(6) The gaming operation has established procedures to ensure that the credit extended is appropriately documented, not least of which would be the patron's identification and signature attesting to the authenticity of the individual credit transactions. The authorizing signature shall be obtained at the time credit is extended.</P>
            <P>(7) The gaming operation has established procedures to effectively document its attempt to collect the full amount of the debt. Such documentation would include, but not be limited to, letters sent to the patron, logs of personal or telephone conversations, proof of presentation of the credit instrument to the patron's bank for collection, settlement agreements, or other documents which demonstrate that the gaming operation has made a good faith attempt to collect the full amount of the debt. Such records documenting collection efforts shall be made available to the TGRA or the commission upon request.</P>
            <P>(k) Maintenance and preservation of books, records and documents. (1) All original books, records and documents pertaining to the conduct of wagering activities shall be retained by a gaming operation in accordance with the following schedule. A record that summarizes gaming transactions is sufficient, provided that all documents containing an original signature(s) attesting to the accuracy of a gaming related transaction are independently preserved. Original books, records or documents shall not include copies of originals, except for copies that contain original comments or notations on parts of multi-part forms. The following original books, records and documents shall be retained by a gaming operation for a minimum of five (5) years:</P>
            <P>(i) Casino cage documents;</P>
            <P>(ii) Documentation supporting the calculation of table game win;</P>
            <P>(iii) Documentation supporting the calculation of gaming machine win;</P>
            <P>(iv) Documentation supporting the calculation of revenue received from the games of keno, pari-mutuel, bingo, pull-tabs, card games, and all other gaming activities offered by the gaming operation;</P>
            <P>(v) Table games statistical analysis reports;</P>
            <P>(vi) Gaming machine statistical analysis reports;</P>
            <P>(vii) Bingo, pull-tab, keno and pari-mutuel wagering statistical reports;</P>
            <P>(viii) Internal audit documentation and reports;</P>
            <P>(ix) Documentation supporting the write-off of gaming credit instruments and named credit instruments;</P>
            <P>(x) All other books, records and documents pertaining to the conduct of wagering activities that contain original signature(s) attesting to the accuracy of the gaming related transaction.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless otherwise specified in this part, all other books, records, and documents shall be retained until such time as the accounting records have been audited by the gaming operation's independent certified public accountants.</P>
            <P>(3) The above definition shall apply without regards to the medium by which the book, record or document is generated or maintained (paper, computer-generated, magnetic media, etc.).</P>

            <P>(1) Be independent and uniform over the range;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide numbers scaled to the ranges required by game rules, and notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, may discard numbers that do not map uniformly onto the required range but must use the first number in sequence that does map correctly to the range;</P>
            <P>(3) Be capable of producing every possible outcome of a game according to its rules; and</P>
            <P>(4) Use an unbiased algorithm. A scaling algorithm is considered to be unbiased if the measured bias is no greater than 1 in 50 million.</P>

            <P>(2) For each enumerated standard for which the TGRA approves an alternate standard, it must submit to the Chair <PRTPAGE P="205"/>within 30 days a detailed report, which must include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) An explanation of how the alternate standard achieves a level of security and integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The alternate standard as approved and the record on which the approval is based.</P>
            <P>(3) In the event that the TGRA or the tribe's government chooses to submit an alternate standard request directly to the Chair for joint government to government review, the TGRA or tribal government may do so without the approval requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Chair review.</E> (1) The Chair may approve or object to an alternate standard approved by a TGRA.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Chair approves the alternate standard, the Tribe may continue to use it as authorized by the TGRA.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Chair objects to the alternate standard, the operation may no longer use the alternate standard and must follow the relevant technical standard set forth in this part.</P>
            <P>(4) Any objection by the Chair must be in written form with an explanation why the alternate standard as approved by the TGRA does not provide a level of security or integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace.</P>
            <P>(5) If the Chair fails to approve or object in writing within 60 days after the date of receipt of a complete submission, the alternate standard is considered approved by the Chair. The Chair may, upon notification to the TGRA, extend this deadline an additional 60 days.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this part?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Voluntary compliance is the goal of the Commission. Voluntary compliance is achieved when a tribe and the NIGC staff are able to resolve any potential enforcement issues prior to the Chair issuing an enforcement action. This part sets forth efforts for achieving voluntary compliance and enforcement action when voluntary compliance is not forthcoming. While this part is intended to garner voluntary compliance through a graduated enforcement process, there may be circumstances under which a graduated enforcement process is omitted and an enforcement action must be taken. This part also sets forth general rules governing the Commission's enforcement of the Act, this chapter, and tribal ordinances and resolutions approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter. Civil fines in connection with notices of violation issued under this part are addressed in part 575 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When may a letter of concern be issued?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Prior to the Chair taking an enforcement action, a letter of concern may be provided by NIGC staff, detailing concerns regarding compliance with the Act, this chapter, or any tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter. A letter of concern describes the available facts and information, includes a preliminary assessment regarding the incident or condition, and indicates that it may be a violation.</P>
            <P>(b) Action under this section does not constitute agency action.</P>
            <P>(c) A letter of concern issued under paragraph (a) of this section must provide a time period for the respondent to respond. If the letter of concern is resolved without enforcement action, NIGC staff may send an investigation completion letter pursuant to § 571.4 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) The Chair's discretion to take an enforcement action is not limited or constrained in any way by this section. When the Chair takes enforcement action before a letter of concern is issued, the enforcement action must state the reasons for moving directly to an enforcement action without first issuing a letter of concern.</P>

            <P>(1) The Chairman may consider the documented benefits derived from the noncompliance, or may rely on reasonable assumptions regarding such benefits.</P>
            <P>(2) If noncompliance continues for more than one day, the Chairman may treat each daily illegal act or omission as a separate violation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Seriousness of the violation.</E> The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine to reflect the seriousness of the violation. In doing so, the Chairman shall consider the extent to which the violation threatens the integrity of Indian gaming.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">History of violations.</E> The Chairman may adjust a civil fine by an amount that reflects the respondent's history of violations over the preceding five (5) years.</P>
            <P>(1) A violation cited by the Chairman shall not be considered unless the associated notice of violation is the subject of a final order of the Commission and has not been vacated; and</P>
            <P>(2) Each violation shall be considered whether or not it led to a civil fine.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Negligence or willfulness.</E> The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of fault of the respondent in causing or failing to correct the violation, either through act or omission.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Good faith.</E> The Chairman may reduce the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of good faith of the respondent in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.</P>

            <P>(2) All petitions for reduction or waiver shall contain:</P>
            <P>(i) A detailed description of the violation that is the subject of the fine;</P>

            <P>(3) The Chairman shall serve the respondent with written notice of his or her determination under paragraph (a) of this section, including a statement of the grounds for the Chairman's decision.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> At any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter, the Chairman and the respondent may agree to settle an enforcement action, including the amount of the associated civil fine. In the event a settlement is reached, a settlement agreement shall be prepared and executed by the Chairman and the respondent. If a settlement agreement is executed, the respondent shall be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of the violation or civil fine in question, except as otherwise provided expressly in the settlement agreement. In the absence of a settlement of the issues under this paragraph, the respondent may contest the assessed civil fine before the Commission in accordance with part 584 or part 585 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(2) The final decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of law or there has been an intervening change in the controlling law; or</P>
            <P>(3) A manifest injustice, clearly apparent or obvious on its face, will occur if the motion for reconsideration is not granted.</P>
            <P>(b) A motion for reconsideration and accompanying brief shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the Commission's final decision and shall be served on all parties, limited participants, and intervenors, if any.

            <P>(g) If the Commission grants the motion, it may reverse or modify the decision, in whole or in part, from which reconsideration is sought or may remand to the Chair for further consideration.</P>
            <P>(h) The filing of a motion for reconsideration will not stay the effect of any decision or order and will not affect the finality of any decision or order for purposes of judicial review, unless so ordered by the Commission.</P>

            <P>(a) To insure that persons displaced as a result of the Act are treated fairly, consistently, and equitably so that these persons will not suffer the disproportionate adverse, social, economic, cultural and other impacts of relocation.</P>

            <P>(b) To set forth the regulations and procedures by which the Commission <PRTPAGE P="238"/>shall operate; and implement the provisions of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) To establish standards consistent with those established in the implementation of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1894, 42 U.S.C. 4601 et. seq., Pub. L. 91-646), hereinafter referred to as the Uniform Act.</P>
            <P>(d) To insure that owners of habitations and other improvements to be acquired pursuant to the Act are treated fairly and consistently, to encourage and expedite acquisition by agreements with such owners, to minimize litigation, relieve congestion in the courts and to promote public confidence in the Commission's relocation program.</P>
            <P>(e) To facilitate development of a relocation plan according to the Act and carry out the directed relocation as promptly and fairly as possible, with a minimum of hardship and discomfort to the relocation, in accordance with the Act.</P>

It will—</P>
            <P>(a) Assure that, within a reasonable period of time prior to displacement, adequate, decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwellings (defined at § 700.55) will be available to all certified eligible heads of households.</P>
            <P>(b) Carry out relocation services in a manner that will promote maximum quality in housing.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">General.</E> The following considerations apply to certified eligible heads of household who are legally separated or divorced and intend to establish separate eligibility.</P>
            <P>(a) Determination of benefits. Eligibility for relocation benefits is determined as of the time that the Relocation Contract is signed.</P>
            <P>(1) If the divorce or separation took place before benefits were first applied for, the spouse who vacated the habitation will not be eligible for benefits and all relocation benefits will accrue to the spouse remaining in occupancy as head of the household remaining to be relocated.</P>
            <P>(2) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at the time that benefits are first applied for, and are divorced or separated prior to signing of a Relocation Contract, both husband and wife may qualify separately for benefits if each meets the requirements of eligibility under these regulations.</P>
            <P>(3) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at the time a Relocation Contract is signed but are divorced or separated prior to occupancy of the replacement dwelling, only one benefit will be paid to the household. Such benefits (including the assistance payment, moving expenses and replacement dwelling benefit) and the purchase price of the habitation and improvements may be prorated between husband and wife in such manner as they may agree in writing so long as such proration is consistent with the terms of the Relocation Contract. Such proration may also be made by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the absence of an agreement between the parties or a court order, any necessary prorations shall be made by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this section, a head of household shall be considered as married even though living apart from his or her spouse unless legally separated under a decree or separate maintenance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Payments to estates.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Relocation benefits can be paid to the estate of a deceased Certified Eligible Head of Household under the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) If there is no household requiring relocation pursuant to the Act surviving the deceased head of household:</P>
            <P>(i) Compensation for the habitation and other improvements owned by the deceased head of household and the cost of removing personal property from the acquired habitation and other improvements shall be paid to the estate of a deceased head of household, or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(ii) No replacement housing benefit or assistance payment (bonus) shall be paid under this circumstance.</P>
            <P>(2) Replacement housing benefits may be paid to an estate only when a certified eligible head of household was qualified for such a housing payment pursuant to the Act and signed a Relocation Contract but died before the replacement housing was occupied. The estate of a certified eligible head of household who had not signed a Relocation Contract at the time of his/her death is not eligible for payment of a replacement housing benefit.</P>

            <P>(b) If one of a married couple who was a certified eligible head of household dies, the surviving spouse may be paid the same relocation assistance benefits, including replacement housing payments, which the couple would have received had death not occurred. If there is no surviving spouse, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a guardian to act for minor members of the household. The Commission shall deal with such guardian and any members of the household who have attained their majority in a manner to <PRTPAGE P="248"/>effect relocation of the remaining household under these regulations.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The fixed payment for moving and related expenses of a displaced business or farm operation that meets applicable requirements under this section is an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with § 700.173, but not less than $2,500 nor more than $10,000.

            </P>
            <P>(2) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having another establishment, which is not being acquired by the Commission, and which is under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities. For purposes of this rule, no remaining business facility which had average annual gross receipts of less than $1,000 and average annual net earnings of less than $500, during the two taxable years prior to displacement, shall be considered “another establishment”; and</P>
            <P>(3) The business had (i) average annual gross receipts of at least $1,000 during the two taxable years prior to displacement, or (ii) average annual net earnings of at least $500 as determined in accordance with § 700.173. However, the Commission may waive this test in any case in which it determines that its use would cause a substantial hardship.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining number of businesses acquired.</E> In determining whether two or more legal entities, all of which have been acquired, constitute a single business, which is entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which—</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Farm operation.</E> A farm operation qualifies for a payment under this section if the Commission determines that it meets the criteria set forth in § 700.171(b)(3).

            <P>(1) The part acquired was a farm operation before the acquisition; or</P>
            <P>(2) The partial acquisition caused the operator to be displaced from the farm operation; or</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Conditions under which move to temporary housing accommodations may be approved.</E> The move of a family or individual into temporary housing accommodations may be approved by the Commission only if the following conditions are met.</P>
            <P>(1) The move will be undertaken because:</P>
            <P>(i) It is necessary because of an emergency as determined by the Commission; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The individual or family is subject to conditions hazardous to his or his family's health or safety.</P>

            <P>(3) The Commission shall have determined that within twelve (12) months of the date of the temporary move, replacement housing meeting Commission-approved standards will be available for occupancy by the persons temporarily rehoused.</P>
            <P>(4) Prior to the move, the Commission shall provide in writing assurance to each head of household that:</P>
            <P>(i) Replacement housing will be available at the earliest possible time but in any event no later than twelve (12) months from the date of the move to temporary housing.</P>
            <P>(ii) Replacement housing will be made available on a priority basis, to the individual or family who has been temporarily rehoused.</P>
            <P>(iii) The move to temporary rehousing will not, in any way, affect a claimant's eligibility for a replacement housing payment nor deprive him of the same choice or replacement housing units that would have been made available had the temporary move not been made.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Commission will pay all costs in connection with the move to temporary housing, including any increased housing costs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agency documentation.</E> To request Commission approval for a temporary move of a family, the following information shall be submitted to the Commission (additional information may be required on a case-by-case basis):</P>
            <P>(1) An explanation of the necessity for the temporary move, based upon the criteria set forth by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(2) The estimated duration of the temporary occupancy.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of the family or individual, (i) a copy of the written assurance which will be provided to the person explaining his rights and the continuing obligation of the agency to provide relocation assistance, and (ii) evidence that the family or individual agrees to make the temporary move.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Costs in connection with temporary move</E>—(1) <E T="03">Costs included.</E> Costs included in a temporary move may cover the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Actual reasonable moving costs and related expenses for the move to temporary accommodations.</P>
            <P>(ii) For the family or individual moved from a rental unit the difference, if any, between the rental cost of the dwelling vacated and the rental cost of the temporary unit.</P>
            <P>(iii) For a homeowner who retains ownership of his dwelling the reasonable cost of renting the temporary dwelling.</P>
            <P>(iv) For a homeowner whose dwelling has been acquired the difference, if any, between his housing costs for the acquired dwelling and the rental cost of the temporary unit.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Costs not a replacement home benefit.</E> Costs in connection with a move to <PRTPAGE P="253"/>temporary accommodations are not to be considered as relocation payments under the Act. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Distinguishing between cost of temporary move and relocation payment.</E> The costs of a temporary move, as decribed in the foregoing subparagraphs, are not to be considered as all or a part of the relocation payment to which a displaced person is entitled under the Act. Thus, when a family is moved to temporary accommodations, a relocation payment is <E T="03">not</E> made and the election or choice of type of payments that would ordinarily be made upon displacement must be delayed until the final move is made. When the move out of temporary accommodations is made, the displaced person shall receive the full relocation payments to which he/she is entitled pursuant to Commission regulations.</P>

            <P>(a) This subpart contains the regulations of the Commission implementing the requirement of subsection (a)(3) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), which provides that the Commission “upon any request for records which (1) Reasonably describes <PRTPAGE P="257"/>such records and (2) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.” This subpart describes the procedures by which records may be obtained from the Commission. The procedures in this subpart are not applicable to requests for records published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or opinions in the adjudication of cases, statements of policy and interpretations and administrative staff manuals which have been published or made available under subpart A of this part.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Act.</E> As used in this subpart, “Act” means the “Freedom of Information Act,” 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 700.239</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Records available.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Commission policy.</E> It is the policy of the Commission to make the records of the Commission available to the public to the greatest extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Statutory disclosure requirement.</E> The Freedom of Information Act requires that the Commission, on a request from a member of the public to inspect or copy records made in accordance with the procedures in this subpart, shall promptly make the records available.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Statutory exemptions.</E> The Act exempts nine categories of records from this disclosure requirement. The Act provides that disclosure is not required of matters that are:</P>
            <P>(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;</P>
            <P>(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>
            <P>(3) Specifically exempt from disclosure by statute;</P>
            <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;</P>
            <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that production of such records would</P>
            <P>(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
            <P>(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,</P>
            <P>(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>
            <P>(iv) Disclose the indentity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source,</P>
            <P>(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or</P>
            <P>(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>
            <P>(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or</P>
            <P>(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Decisions on requests.</E> It is the policy of the Commission to withhold information falling within an exemption only if (1) disclosure is prohibited by statute or Executive Order or (2) sound grounds exist for invocation of the exemption.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Deletion of portions of records.</E> If a requested record contains material within an exemption together with material not within an exemption and it is determined under the regulations in this subpart to withhold the exempt material, any reasonably segregable nonexempt material shall be separated from the exempt material.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Creation of records.</E> This subpart applies only to records which exist at the time a request for records is made. Records are not required to be created in response to a request by combining <PRTPAGE P="258"/>or compiling selected items from the files or by preparing a new computer program, nor are records required to be created to provide the requester with such data as proportions, percentages, frequency distributions, trends, or comparisons.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Records of concern to other departments and agencies.</E> (1) If the release of a record would be of concern to both the Commission and another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the Commission only if the interest of the Commission is the primary interest. If the Commission's interest is not the primary interest, the requester shall be referred in writing to the agency having the primary interest. The Commission has the primary interest in a record if the record was developed pursuant to Commission regulations, directives, or request even though the record originated outside of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(2) If the release of a record in which the Commission has a primary interest would be of substantial concern to another agency, the official processing the request, should, if administratively feasible and appropriate, consult with that agency before releasing the record.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Records obtained from the public.</E> If a requested record was obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the Government, the official responsible for processing the request shall, when it is administratively feasible to do so, seek the views of that person or entity on whether the record should be released before making a decision on the request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Submission of requests.</E> A request to inspect or copy records shall be made to the installation where the records are located. If the records are located at more than one installation or if the specific location of the records is not known to the person wishing to inspect or copy the records, he may direct his request to the head of the appropriate bureau, or the bureau's chief public information officer, if any.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of request.</E> (1) Requests invoking the Freedom of Information Act shall be in writing.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) A request must reasonably describe the records requested. A request reasonably describes the records requested if it will enable an employee of the Commission familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If such information is available, the request should identify the subject matter of the record, the date when it was made, the place where it was made, and the person or office that made it, the present custodian of the record, and any other information which will assist in location of the requested records. If the request involves a matter known by the requester to be in litigation, the request should also state the case name and court hearing the case.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the description of a record sought is insufficient to allow identification and location of the record, the response denying the request on this ground shall so state and, to the extent possible, indicate what additional descriptive information, if any, would assist in location of the record.</P>
            <P>(3) A request shall state the maximum amount of fees which the requester is willing to pay. Requesters are notified that under § 700.251, the failure to state willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated by the Commission will delay running of the time limit and delay processing of the request, if the responsible official anticipates that the fees chargeable may exceed $25.00.</P>

            <P>(4)(i) To insure expeditious handling, requests shall be prominently marked, both on the envelope and on the face of the request, with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.” The failure of a request to bear such a legend will not disqualify a request from processing under the procedures in this subpart if the request otherwise meets the requirments of this section. A request not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” will not, however, be deemed to have been received for purposes of the running of the time limit set out in § 700.245 until it has been identified by bureau personnel as a Freedom of Information request and marked by them with this legend.<PRTPAGE P="259"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the public not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” as a request otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.” (B) date the request to reflect the date on which it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the request under the procedures in this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Categorical requests.</E> (1) A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if (i) it can be determined which particular records are covered by the request and (ii) the records can be searched for, collected and produced without unduly burdening or interfering with Commission operations because of the staff time consumed or the resulting disruption of the files.</P>
            <P>(2) If a categorical request is determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section not to reasonably describe the records requested, the response denying the request on that ground shall specify the reasons why and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with knowledgeable Commission personnel in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly procedure for the production of the records.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Granting of requests.</E> (1) A requested record shall be made available if (i) the record is not exempt from disclosure or (ii) the record is exempt from disclosure, but its withholding is neither required by statute or Executive order nor supported by sound grounds.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of grant.</E> (1) When a requested record has been determined to be available, the official processing the request shall immediately notify the person requesting the record as to where and when the record is available for inspection or as the case may be, where and when copies will be available. If fees are due under § 700.251, the responsible official shall also state the amount or, if the exact amount cannot be determined, the approximate amount of fees due.</P>
            <P>(2) If the record was obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the Government, the responsible official shall, when it is administratively feasible to do so, notify that person or entity that the record has been made available.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Denial of requests.</E> (1) A request for a record may be denied only if it is determined that (i) the record is exempt from disclosure and (ii) that withholding of the record is required by statute or Executive order or supported by sound grounds.</P>
            <P>(2) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be denied only by the Freedom of Information Act Officer or by an official whom the Executive Director has in writing designated.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Form of denial.</E> A reply denying a request shall be in writing and shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholding of the record;</P>
            <P>(2) The sound ground for withholding;</P>
            <P>(3) A listing of the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Commission pursuant to § 700.247 and that such appeal must be in writing and be received by this official within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after the date of the denial, in the case of the denial of an entire request, or within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) of records being made available, in the case of a partial denial, by writing to the Freedom of Information Act Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section do not apply to requests denied under § 2.14 on the ground that the request did not reasonably describe the records requested or to requests for records which do not exist.<PRTPAGE P="260"/>
            </P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Filing of denials.</E> Copies of all replies denying, in whole or part, a request for a record which are issued under this section of § 700.243 shall be promptly submitted by the Freedom of Information Act Officer, denials to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.</P>

A determination whether to grant or deny a request shall be made within no more than ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of a request. This determination shall be communicated immediately to the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Running of basic time limit.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the time limit commences to run when a request is received at the Commission's office in Flagstaff, Arizona.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Extensions of time.</E> In the following unusual circumstances, the time limit for acting upon an initial request may be extended to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, but in no case may the time limit be extended for more than ten (10) working days:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Authority to make extensions.</E> (1) An extension of time under paragraph (c) of this section may be made only by the Freedom of Information Act Officer or such higher authority as the Commission has in writing designated.</P>
            <P>(2) The person requesting the records shall be notified in writing of the extension. The written notice shall state the reason for the extension and the date on which a determination on the request is expected to be dispatched.</P>
            <P>(3) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Treatment of delay as denial.</E> (1) If no determination has been reached at the end of the ten (10) day period for deciding an initial request, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem his request denied and may exercise a right of appeal in accordance with the provisions of § 700.247.</P>
            <P>(2) When no determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the responsible official shall nevertheless continue to process the request. On expiration of the time limit, the responsible official shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right to treat the delay as a denial for purposes of appeal to the Commission in accordance with § 700.247. The requester may be asked to consider delaying use of his right to appeal until the date on which the determination is expected to be dispatched. If the requester so agrees, he is deemed not to have treated the failure to respond within the applicable time limit as a denial for purposes of the running of the twenty (20) working-day appeal period set out in § 700.247. If a determination of the request is not issued by the new agreed upon date, or if the request is denied in whole or part, the requester will have available his full right of appeal under § 700.247, including the entire twenty (20) working-day period for filing of the appeal.</P>

            <P>(2) The Executive Director shall, in writing, advise the appellant of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a final determination of the appeal is expected to be dispatched.</P>

            <P>(3) If no determination on the appeal has been reached at the end of the twenty (20) working-day period for deciding an appeal, or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the appeal will nevertheless continue to be processed. On expiration of the time limit, the requester shall be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to consider delaying resort to his right to judicial review until the date on which the determination on his appeal is expected to be dispatched.<PRTPAGE P="262"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Form of decision.</E> The final determination on an appeal shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the determination. If the determination is to release the requested records or portions thereof, the Freedom of Information Act Officer shall immediately make the records available or instruct the appropriate bureau official to make them immediately available. If the determination upholds in whole or part the initial denial of a request for records, the determination shall advise the requester of his right to obtain judicial review in the U.S. District Court for the district in which the withheld records are located, or in which the requester resides or has his principal place of business or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Distribution of copies.</E> Copies of final determinations issued by the Commission shall be provided to the Commission's legal counsel.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Services for which fees may be charged.</E> (1) Unless waived pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, user fees shall be charged for document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests for records. User fees also shall be charged for the formal certification of verification attached to authenticated copies of records under the seal of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless waived or reduced pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, user fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedule of charges contained in the Commission's Management Manual.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Services for which fees may not be charged.</E> No fee may be charged for any services required by the Freedom of Information Act to be performed in responding to a request for records other than those services for which fees may be charged under paragraph (a) of this section. Services for which no fees may be charged include, but are not limited to,</P>
            <P>(1) Examining requested records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure or whether, even if exempt, they should nevertheless be made available in whole or part,</P>
            <P>(2) Deleting exempt matter from records so that the remaining portions of the records may be made available,</P>
            <P>(3) Monitoring a requester's inspection of agency records made available to him for inspection, and</P>
            <P>(4) Resolving legal and policy issues affecting access to requested records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Fees otherwise chargeable for document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests for records may be waived or reduced, as appropriate, if the official making the records available determines that furnishing the records can be considered as primarily benefiting the public as opposed to the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) Fees otherwise applicable for document research and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived and not charged if the request involves:</P>
            <P>(i) Furnishing unauthenticated copies of any documents reproduced for gratuitous distribution;</P>
            <P>(ii) Furnishing one copy of a personal document (e.g., a birth certificate) to a person who has been required to furnish it for retention by the Commission;</P>
            <P>(iii) Furnishing one copy of the transcript of a hearing before a hearing officer in a grievance or similar proceeding to the employee for whom the hearing was held.</P>
            <P>(3) Fees otherwise chargeable for document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived or reduced if the cost of collecting the fee would exceed the amount of the fee or if the request involves:</P>

            <P>(ii) Furnishing records to donors with respect to their gifts;</P>

            <P>(v) Furnishing records when to do so saves costs and yields income equal to the direct cost of providing the records (e.g., where the Commission's fee for the service would be included in a billing against the Commission);</P>
            <P>(vi) Furnishing records when to do so is in conformance with generally established business custom (e.g., furnishing personal reference data to prospective employers of former Commission employees);</P>
            <P>(vii) Furnishing one copy of a record in order to assist the requester to obtain financial benefits to which he is entitled (e.g., veterans or their dependents, employees with Government employee compensation claims or persons insured by the Government).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees and prepayment.</E> (1) Where it is anticipated that fees chargeable under this section may amount to more than $25.00 and the requester has not indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the request shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the time limits established by § 700.245 until the requester is advised of the fees which are anticipated and has agreed to pay these fees. Advice to requesters with respect to anticipated fees shall be provided promptly.</P>
            <P>(2) The appropriate cases, advance payment of fees may be required before requested records are made available to the requester.</P>
            <P>(3) A notice of anticipated fees or notice of request for advance payment shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with appropriate personnel in an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the anticipated fees and meet the needs of the requester.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Form of payment.</E> Payment of fees shall be made by check or money order payable to the Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission. The term United States or the initials “U.S.” shall not be included on the check or money order. Where appropriate, the official responsible for handling a request may require that payment by check be made in the form of a certified check.</P>

Commission employees shall not allow themselves to be placed in a position in which a conflict of interest might arise or might justifiably be suspected. Such a conflict may arise or appear to arise by the acceptance of gratuities or by any action which could reasonably be interpreted as influencing the strict impartiality that must prevail in all business relationships involving the Commission. However, this requirement of impartiality is not intended to prohibit advocacy of client interests, as is required as a stated duty of certain agency positions. Such advocacy may occur for example during warrantee representation or during technical representation with builders.</P>

            <P>(a) Commission personnel shall not engage in any personal, business, or professional activity, or receive or retain any direct or indirect financial interest, which places them in a position of conflict or apparent conflict between their private interests and the public interests of the United States as related to the duties of their Commission positions.</P>

            <P>(1) No Commission employee shall have a personal interest in a contract, subcontract, memorandum of understanding or agreement, or other arrangement resulting in payment for the delivery of goods, services, or supplies to the Commission, to the Navajo or Hopi tribal governments, or to individual relocatees or groups of relocatees.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Gifts, entertainment and favors.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Acceptance of gratuities, including gifts, entertainment and favors, (no matter how innocently tendered or received) from those who have or seek business dealings with the Commission, is prohibited as it may be a source of embarrassment to the recipient, and may impair public confidence in the integrity of the conduct of the Government's business. It is emphasized that prohibited conflicts and apparent conficts of interest can sometimes arise even from relationships and transactions that the persons concerned perceive as inconsequential.</P>

            <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, Commission personnel and their spouses, minor children and members of their households shall not solicit nor accept, either directly or indirectly, any gift, <PRTPAGE P="289"/>gratuity, favor, entertainment loan or any other thing of monetary value from any person who:</P>

            <P>(3) An employee may accept an invitation extended by a relocatee to attend a housewarming, potluck, accept a meal and refreshments while traveling on the reservation, or similar social activity when circumstances would make it rude for the employee to refuse.</P>
            <P>(4) Other circumstances may arise in which it would be to the Commission's advantage for an employee to participate in activities ordinarily prohibited. In such cases, the employee shall consult with his or her supervisor about the course of action to be followed. If prior consultation is not possible, the employee shall exercise prudent judgement and promptly inform the supervisor of the activity.</P>

            <P>Commission employees may engage in outside work or other activity which does not create a conflict between the employee's private interests and official duties nor prevent employees from devoting their talents and energies to the Commission. An employee's outside work shall not reflect discredit upon the Commission.</P>
            <P>(a) Employees engaged in or considering outside employment shall inform their supervisor of the work, and supply such additional details as may be required to determine whether the employment is compatible with the full and proper discharge of the employee's official duties.</P>
            <P>(b) Similarly, employees shall inform the supervisor and request approval of other types of outside activities which may present an actual or apparent conflict of interest between the employees' official duties and their private lives. The supervisor shall determine if the outside employment or activity is prohibited by these regulations, and so inform the employee. The Designated Agency Ethics Official is available to assist supervisors in making such determinations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Guidelines and limitations.</E> Outside employment or other outside activity is incompatible with the full and proper discharge of an employee's duties and responsibilities and hence is prohibited if:</P>

            <P>(2) It would be of such extent or nature as to interfere with the efficient performance of the employee's Government duties, or impair the employee's mental or physical capacity to perform them in an acceptable manner.</P>
            <P>(3) It would tend to influence the exercise or impartial judgement on any matters coming before the employee in the course of his or her duties;</P>

            <P>(4) It would involve work for contractors, subcontractors, realtors, tribal offices, clients or other entities and individuals which have business with or receive services from the Commission or <PRTPAGE P="290"/>conduct activities which are regulated by the Commission.</P>

            <P>(9) It would be of a nature which might be construed by the general public to be an official act of the Commission, or would give the impression that a business or product which is involved in the relocation project is officially endorsed or approved by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(10) It would involve use by the employee of official facilities, e.g., office space, office machines, or supplies, or the services of other employees during duty hours.</P>
            <P>(11) It might bring discredit upon, or cause unfavorable criticism of, the Government or the Commission or lead to relationships which might impair public confidence in the integrity of the Government or the Commission.</P>
            <P>(12) It would involve the use of information obtained as a result of Government employment that is not freely available to the general public in that it either has not been made available to the general public or would not be made available upon request.</P>

            <P>(e) Commission personnel may not accept compensation for an article, speech, consultant service, or other activity if it involves the use of information obtained as the result of Government employment which is not available to the general public as described in paragraph (a) of this section, or results in an actual or appearance of conflict of interest.</P>
            <P>(f) Unless there is a definite Commission position on a matter which is the subject of an employee's writing or speech, and the individual has been authorized by the Commissioners to present that position officially, the employee shall expressly present his or her views on the matter as his or her own and not as those of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(g) The right of an employee to express personal opinions is respected.

            <SUBJECT>Sexual harassment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Sexual harassment is a form of employee misconduct which undermines the integrity of the employment relationship. All employees must be allowed to work in an environment free from unsolicited and unwelcome sexual overtures. Sexual harassment is defined by the Office of Personnel Management as “deliberate or repeated unsolicited verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are unwelcome.” Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments. It refers to behavior which is not welcome, which is personally offensive and debilitates morale, interfering with the work effectiveness of its victims and their co-workers.</P>

            <P>(b) Sexual harassment is a prohibited personnel practice when it results in discrimination for or against an employee on the basis of conduct not related to performance.
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <FP>For example:</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">—If submission to sexual advances is a condition of employment, whether expressed in explicit or implicit terms;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">—If employment decisions, such as promotion, training, salary increases, rewards, etc., are based on an employee's submission to or rejection of sexual advances;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">—If the sexual conduct substantially interferes with an affected person's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.</FP>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <PRTPAGE P="294"/>
            <P>(c) Within the Federal Government, a supervisor who uses implicit or explicit coercive sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, salary or job of an employee is engaging in sexual harassment. Similarly, an employee of an agency who behaves in this manner in the process of conducting agency business is engaging in sexual harassment. Finally, any employee who participates in deliberate or repeated unsolicited verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are unwelcome and interfere with work productivity is also engaging in sexual harassment.</P>
            <P>(d) It is the policy of the Relocation Commission that sexual harassment is unacceptable conduct in the workplace and will not be condoned. An employee who believes that he or she is subject to sexual harassment may contact one or more of the following people within the Commission for assistance:</P>
            <P>(1) The immediate supervisor or second level supervisor.</P>
            <P>(2) The EEO Counselor.</P>
            <P>(3) The agency EEO Officer.</P>

            <P>(4) Where the facts warrant a conclusion that a violation has occurred, the Federal Land Manager shall determine a penalty amount in accordance with § 700.831.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of assessment.</E> The Federal Land Manager shall notify the person served with a notice of violation of the penalty amount assessed by serving a written notice of assessment, either in person or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested).

            <P>(g) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> (1) Except where the right to request a hearing is deemed to have been waived as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the person served with a notice of assessment may file a written request for a hearing with the adjudicatory body specified in the notice.

            <P>(2) Failure to deliver a written request for a hearing within 45 days of the date of service of the notice of assessment shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.</P>
            <P>(3) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be held in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554. In any such hearing, the amount of civil penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with this part, and shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Federal Land Manager under paragraph (f) of this section of any offer of mitigation or remission made by the Federal Land Manager.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Final administrative decision.</E> (1) Where the person served with a notice of violation has accepted the penalty pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the notice of violation shall constitute the final administrative decision;</P>
            <P>(2) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has not filed a timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the notice of assessment shall constitute the final administrative decision;</P>

            <P>(2) Upon failure to pay the penalty, the Federal Land Manager may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to collect the penalty in a U.S. District Court for any district in which the person assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts business. Where the Federal Land Manager is not represented by the Attorney General, a civil action may be initiated directly by the Federal Land Manager.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Other remedies not waived.</E> Assessment of a penalty under this section shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to pursue other available legal or administrative remedies.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of loss or absence of archaeological interest.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Under certain circumstances, a Federal land manager may determine, pursuant to § 700.805(a)(5) of this part, that certain material remains are not or are no longer of archaeological interest, and therefore not to be considered archaeological resources under this part.</P>
            <P>(b) The Federal land manager may make such a determination if he/she finds that the material remains are not capable of providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior, cultural adaptation, and related topics.</P>
            <P>(c) Prior to making a determination that material remains are not or are no longer archaeological resources, the Federal land manager shall ensure that the following procedures are completed.</P>
            <P>(1) A professional archaeological evaluation of material remains and similar materials within the area under consideration shall be completed, consistent with the Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation and with the 36 CFR parts 60, 63, and 65.</P>
            <P>(2) The principal Office archaeologist or, in the absence of a principal Office archaeologist, the Office Consulting Archaeologist, shall establish whether the material remains under consideration contribute to scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior, cultural adaption and related topics. The principal Office archaeologist or the Office Consulting Archaeologist, as appropriate, shall make a recommendation to the Federal land manager concerning these material remains.</P>
            <P>(d) The Federal land manager shall make the determination based upon the facts established by and the recommendation of the principal Office archaeologist or the Office Consulting Archaeologist, as appropriate, and shall fully document the basis therefor, including consultation with Indian tribes for determinations regarding sites of religious or cultural importance.</P>
            <P>(e) The Federal land manger shall make public notice of the determination and its limitations, including any permitting requirements, for activities associated with the materials determined not to be archaeological resources for the purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) Any interested individual may request in writing that the Office Consulting Archaeologist review any final determination by the Federal land manager that certain remains are not, or are no longer, archaeological resources. Two (2) copies of the request should be sent to the Office Consulting Archaeologist, care of Land Use Manager, Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation, PO Box KK, Flagstaff, AZ 86002, and should document why the requestor disagrees with the determination of the Federal land manger. The Office Consulting Archaeologist shall review the request, and, if appropriate, shall review the Federal land manager's determination and its supporting documentation. Based upon this review, the Departmental Consulting Archaeologist shall prepare a final professional recommendation, and shall transmit the recommendation and the basis therefor to the head of the bureau for further consideration within 60 days of the receipt of the request.</P>
            <P>(g) Any determination made pursuant to this section shall in no way affect the Federal land manager's obligation under other applicable laws or regulations.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 700.843</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Permitting procedures for Navajo Nation Lands.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Pursuant to the Act and this subpart, the written consent of the Navajo Nation is required. Written consent shall consist of a Navajo Nation permit issued in accordance with the Navajo Nation Code or a resolution of the Navajo Nation Council or delegated committee of that Council.</P>

            <P>(b) When Indian tribal lands are involved in an application for a permit or a request for extension or modification of a permit, the consent of the Indian tribal government must be obtained. For Indian allotted lands outside reservation boundaries, consent from only the individual landowner is needed. When multiple-owner allotted lands are involved, consent by more than 50 percent of the ownership interest is <PRTPAGE P="313"/>sufficient. For Indian allotted lands within reservation boundaries, consent must be obtained from the Navajo Nation and the individual landowner(s).</P>
            <P>(c) The applicant should consult with the Office concerning procedures for obtaining consent from the appropriate Indian tribal authorities and submit the permit application to the Office. The Office shall ensure that consultation with the Navajo Nation or individual Indian landowner regarding terms and conditions of the permit occurs prior to detailed evaluation of the application. Permits shall include terms and conditions requested by the Navajo Nation or Indian landowner pursuant to § 700.817 of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) The issuance of a permit under this part does not remove the requirement for any other permit by Indian tribal law.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 720.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens <PRTPAGE P="317"/>but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 720.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 720.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Housing.</E> The agency shall ensure that any dwelling purchased for a relocatee household is readily accessible to and usable by any handicapped person who is a member of that household.</P>

          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 720.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 900.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Policy statements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Congressional policy.</E> (1) Congress has recognized the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction, planning, conduct and administration of educational as well as other Federal programs and services to Indian communities so as to render such programs and services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.<PRTPAGE P="330"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Congress has declared its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.</P>
            <P>(3) Congress has declared that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.</P>
            <P>(4) Congress has declared that the programs, functions, services, or activities that are contracted and funded under this Act shall include administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that support the delivery of services to Indians, including those administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are otherwise contractible. The administrative functions referred to in the preceding sentence shall be contractible without regard to the organizational level within the Department that carries out such functions. Contracting of the administrative functions described herein shall not be construed to limit or reduce in any way the funding for any program, function, service, or activity serving any other tribe under the Act or any other law. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another Indian tribe or tribal organization under this Act.</P>
            <P>(5) Congress has further declared that each provision of the Act and each provision of contracts entered into thereunder shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the tribes or tribal organizations to transfer the funding and the related functions, services, activities, and programs (or portions thereof), that are otherwise contractible under the Act, including all related administrative functions, from the Federal government to the contractor.</P>
            <P>(6) Congress has declared that one of the primary goals of the 1994 amendments to the Act was to minimize the reporting requirements applicable to tribal contractors and to eliminate excessive and burdensome reporting requirements. Reporting requirements over and above the annual audit report are to be negotiated with disagreements subject to the declination procedures of section 102 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(7) Congress has declared that there not be any threshold issues which would avoid the declination, contract review, approval, and appeal process.</P>
            <P>(8) Congress has declared that all self-determination contract proposals must be supported by the resolution of an Indian tribe(s).</P>
            <P>(9) Congress has declared that to the extent that programs, functions, services, and activities carried out by tribes and tribal organizations pursuant to contracts entered into under this Act reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of contract funds determined under section 106(a) of the Act, the Secretary shall make such savings available for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries, either directly or through contractors, in a manner equitable to both direct and contracted programs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Secretarial policy.</E> (1) It is the policy of the Secretary to facilitate the efforts of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to plan, conduct and administer programs, functions, services and activities, or portions thereof, which <PRTPAGE P="331"/>the Departments are authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians. The Secretary shall make best efforts to remove any obstacles which might hinder Indian tribes and tribal organizations including obstacles that hinder tribal autonomy and flexibility in the administration of such programs.</P>
            <P>(2) It is the policy of the Secretary to encourage Indian tribes and tribal organizations to become increasingly knowledgeable about the Departments' programs administered for the benefit of Indians by providing information on such programs, functions and activities and the opportunities Indian tribes have regarding them.</P>
            <P>(3) It is the policy of the Secretary to provide a uniform and consistent set of rules for contracts under the Act. The rules contained herein are designed to facilitate and encourage Indian tribes to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs serving Indian people. The Secretary shall afford Indian tribes and tribal organizations the flexibility, information, and discretion necessary to design contractible programs to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious and institutional needs.</P>
            <P>(4) The Secretary recognizes that contracting under the Act is an exercise by Indian tribes of the government-to-government relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes. When an Indian tribe contracts, there is a transfer of the responsibility with the associated funding. The tribal contractor is accountable for managing the day-to-day operations of the contracted Federal programs, functions, services, and activities. The contracting tribe thereby accepts the responsibility and accountability to the beneficiaries under the contract with respect to use of the funds and the satisfactory performance of the programs, functions, services and activities funded under the contract. The Secretary will continue to discharge the trust responsibilities to protect and conserve the trust resources of Indian tribes and the trust resources of individual Indians.</P>
            <P>(5) The Secretary recognizes that tribal decisions to contract or not to contract are equal expressions of self-determination.</P>
            <P>(6) The Secretary shall maintain consultation with tribal governments and tribal organizations in the Secretary's budget process relating to programs, functions, services and activities subject to the Act. In addition, on an annual basis, the Secretary shall consult with, and solicit the participation of, Indian tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (including participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations in formulating annual budget requests that the Secretary submits to the President for submission to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code).</P>
            <P>(7) The Secretary is committed to implementing and fully supporting the policy of Indian self-determination by recognizing and supporting the many positive and successful efforts and directions of tribal governments and extending the applicability of this policy to all operational components within the Department. By fully extending Indian self-determination contracting to all operational components within the Department having programs or portions of programs for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) and for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E), it is the Secretary's intent to support and assist Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments capable of administering quality programs that meet the tribally determined needs and directions of their respective communities. It is also the policy of the Secretary to have all other operational components within the Department work cooperatively with tribal governments on a government-to-government basis so as to expedite the transition away from Federal domination of Indian programs and make the ideals of Indian self-government and self-determination a reality.</P>

            <P>(8) It is the policy of the Secretary that the contractibility of programs under this Act should be encouraged. <PRTPAGE P="332"/>In this regard, Federal laws and regulations should be interpreted in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of those programs or portions of those programs that are for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act, and that are for the benefit of Indians because of their status of Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(9) It is the Secretary's policy that no later than upon receipt of a contract proposal under the Act (or written notice of an Indian tribe or tribal organization's intention to contract), the Secretary shall commence planning such administrative actions, including but not limited to transfers or reductions in force, transfers of property, and transfers of contractible functions, as may be necessary to ensure a timely transfer of responsibilities and funding to Indian tribes and tribal organizations.</P>
            <P>(10) It is the policy of the Secretary to make available to Indian tribes and tribal organizations all administrative functions that may lawfully be contracted under the Act, employing methodologies consistent with the methodology employed with respect to such functions under titles III and IV of the Act.</P>
            <P>(11) The Secretary's commitment to Indian self-determination requires that these regulations be liberally construed for the benefit of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to effectuate the strong Federal policy of self-determination and, further, that any ambiguities herein be construed in favor of the Indian tribe or tribal organization so as to facilitate and enable the transfer of services, programs, functions, and activities, or portions thereof, authorized by the Act.</P>

            <P>The Secretary may only decline to approve a proposal for one of five specific reasons:</P>
            <P>(a) The service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;</P>
            <P>(b) Adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;</P>
            <P>(c) The proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;</P>
            <P>(d) The amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 106(a) of the Act; or</P>

            <P>(e) The program, function, service, or activity (or a portion thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond <PRTPAGE P="337"/>the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under section 102(a)(1) of the Act because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.</P>

            <P>In those situations the Secretary is required, as appropriate, to approve the portion of the program, function, service, or activity that is authorized under section 102(a) of the Act, or approve a level of funding that is authorized under section 106(a) of the Act.

            <SECTNO>§ 900.114</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Why is there a separate subpart in these regulations for construction contracts and grants?</SUBJECT>
            <P>There is a separate subpart because the Act differentiates between construction contracts and the model agreement in section 108 of the Act which is required for contracting other activities. Construction contracts are separately defined in the Act and are subject to a separate proposal and review process.</P>
          </SECTION>

            <SECTNO>§ 900.115</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do self-determination construction contracts relate to ordinary Federal procurement contracts?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A self-determination construction contract is a government-to-government agreement that transfers control of the construction project, including administrative functions, to the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization to facilitate effective and meaningful participation by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in planning, conducting, and administering the construction project, and so that the construction project is responsive to the true needs of the Indian community. The Secretary's role in the conduct of a contracted construction project is limited to the Secretary's responsibilities set out in § 900.131.</P>
            <P>(b) Self-determination construction contracts are not traditional “procurement” contracts.</P>

            <P>(1) With respect to a construction contract (or a subcontract of such a construction contract), the provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the regulations promulgated under that Act, shall apply to a construction contract or subcontract only to the extent that application of the provision is:</P>
            <P>(i) Necessary to ensure that the contract may be carried out in a satisfactory manner;</P>
            <P>(ii) Directly related to the construction activity; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Not inconsistent with the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) A list of the Federal requirements that meet the requirements of this paragraph shall be included in an attachment to the contract under negotiations between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization.</P>
            <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no Federal law listed in section 105(3)(C)(ii) of the Act or any other provision of Federal law (including an Executive order) relating to acquisition by the Federal government shall apply to a construction contract that an Indian tribe or tribal organization enters into under this Act, unless expressly provided in the law.</P>
            <P>(c) Provisions of a construction contract under this subpart shall be liberally construed in favor of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Are negotiated fixed-price contracts treated the same as cost-reimbursable contracts?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes, except that in negotiated fixed-price construction contracts, appropriate clauses shall be negotiated to allocate properly the contract risks between the government and the contractor.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to planning services?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) These regulations apply to planning services contracts only as provided in this section.</P>
            <P>(1) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit to the Secretary for review and approval the POR documents produced as a part of a model contract under section 108 of the Act or under a construction contract under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(i) Within 60 days after receipt of the POR from the Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that has achieved priority ranking or that is funded, the Secretary shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Approve the POR;</P>
            <P>(B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR that the Secretary may have; or</P>
            <P>(C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 60 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days.</P>
            <P>(ii) Within a maximum of 180 days after receipt of a POR from an Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that is not funded and is not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Approve the POR; or</P>
            <P>(B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR; or</P>
            <P>(C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 180 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days.</P>
            <P>(2) Any failure of the Secretary to act on a POR within the applicable period required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be deemed a rejection of the POR and will authorize the commencement of any appeal as provided in section 110 of the Act, or, if a model agreement under section 108 of the Act is used, the disputes provision of that agreement.</P>
            <P>(3) If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to provide planning services as part of a construction contract rather than under a model agreement as set out in section 108 of the Act, the regulations in this subpart shall apply.</P>
            <P>(b) The parties to the contract are encouraged to consult during the development of the POR and following submission of the POR to the Secretary.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to construction management services?</SUBJECT>
            <P>No. Construction management services may be contracted separately under section 108 of the Act. Construction management services consultants and/or Indian tribe or tribal organization employees assist and advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization to implement construction contracts, but have no contractual relationship with or authority to direct construction contract subcontractors.</P>
            <P>(a) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses to contract solely for construction management services, these services shall be limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary;</P>
            <P>(2) Review of work produced by the Secretary to determine compliance with:</P>
            <P>(i) The POR and design contract during the design stage; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The project construction documents during the construction stage;</P>
            <P>(3) Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the disputes clause of the CMS contract.</P>

            <P>(b) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization conducts CMS under section 108 of the Act and the Indian tribe or <PRTPAGE P="354"/>tribal organization contracts separately under this subpart for all or some of the activities in § 900.110, the contracted activities shall be limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and Secretary;</P>
            <P>(2) Preparation of tribal or tribal organization construction subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of tribal or tribal organization construction contract subcontractors;</P>
            <P>(3) Review of work produced by tribal or tribal organization construction subcontractors to determine compliance with:</P>
            <P>(i) The POR and the design contract during the design stage; or</P>

            <P>Within 30 days after the Secretary's allocation of funds for planning phase, design phase, or construction phase activities for a specific project, the Secretary shall notify, by registered mail with return receipt in order to document mailing, the Indian tribe or tribal organization(s) to be benefitted by the availability of the funds for each phase of a project. The Secretarial notice of fund allocation shall offer technical assistance in the preparation of a contract proposal.</P>
            <P>(a) The Secretary shall, within 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, furnish the Indian tribe or tribal organization with all information available to the Secretary about the project including, but not limited to: construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports and archeological reports.</P>
            <P>(b) An Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to request this information prior to submitting a notification of intent to contract or a contract proposal.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary shall have a continuing responsibility to furnish information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens during the preplanning phase and can an Indian tribe or tribal organization perform any of the activities involved in this process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The application and ranking process for developing a priority listing of projects varies between agencies. There are, however, steps in the selection process that are common to most selection processes. An Indian tribe or tribal organization that wishes to secure a construction project should contact the appropriate agency to determine the specific steps involved in the application and selection process used to fund specific types of projects. When a priority process is used in the selection of construction projects, the steps involved in the application and ranking process are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Application.</E> The agency solicits applications from Indian tribes or tribal organizations. In the request for applications, the Secretary provides specific information regarding the type of project to be funded, the objective criteria that will be used to evaluate applications, the points or weight that each criterion will be assigned, and the time when applications are due. An Indian tribe or tribal organization may prepare the application (technical assistance from the agency, within resources available, shall be provided upon request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization) or may rely upon the agency to prepare the application.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ranking/Prioritization.</E> The Secretary evaluates the applications based on the criteria provided as part of the application preparation process. The <PRTPAGE P="355"/>Secretary applies only criteria and weights assigned to each criteria that were disclosed to the Indian tribe or tribal organization during the application stage. The applications are then ranked in order from the application that best meets application criteria to the application that least meet the application criteria.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Validation.</E> Before final acceptance of a ranked application, the information, such as demographic information, deficiency levels reported in application, the condition of existing facilities, and program housing needs, is validated. During this process, additional information may be developed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in support of the original information or the Secretary may designate a representative of the Department to conduct an on-site review of the information contained in the application.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 900.122</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What does an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if it wants to secure a construction contract?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Act establishes a special process for review and negotiation of proposals for construction contracts which is different than that for other self-determination contract proposals. The Indian tribe or tribal organization should notify the Secretary of its intent to contract. After notification, the Indian tribe or tribal organization should prepare its contract proposal in accordance with the sections of this subpart. While developing its construction contract proposal, the Indian tribe or tribal organization can request technical assistance from the Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the Secretary shall provide to the Indian tribe or tribal organization all information available about the construction project, including construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports, and archaeological reports. The responsibility of the Secretary to furnish this information shall be a continuing one.</P>
            <P>(b) At the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization and before finalizing its construction contract proposal, the Secretary shall provide for a precontract negotiation phase during the development of a contract proposal. Within 30 days the Secretary shall acknowledge receipt of the proposal and, if requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, shall confer with the Indian tribe or tribal organization to develop a negotiation schedule. The negotiation phase shall include, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(1) The provision of technical assistance under section 103 of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) A joint scoping session between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization to review all plans, specifications, engineering reports, cost estimates, and other information available to the parties, for the purpose of identifying all areas of agreement and disagreement;</P>
            <P>(3) An opportunity for the Secretary to revise plans, designs, or cost estimates of the Secretary in response to concerns raised, or information provided by, the Indian tribe or tribal organization;</P>
            <P>(4) A negotiation session during which the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall seek to develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal; and</P>
            <P>(5) Upon the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization, the use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve remaining areas of disagreement under the dispute resolution provisions under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of the United States Code.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization are unable to develop a mutually agreeable construction contract proposal under the procedures in § 900.122, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may submit a final contract proposal to the Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving the final contract proposal, the Secretary shall approve the contract proposal and award the contract, unless, during the period the Secretary declines the proposal under sections <PRTPAGE P="356"/>102(a)(2) and 102(b) of the Act (including providing opportunity for an appeal under section 102(b)).</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts under section 102(a)(2) of the Act, the Secretary shall:</P>
            <P>(1) State any objections to the contract proposal (as submitted by the Indian tribe or tribal organization) in writing and provide all documents relied on in making the declination decision within 20 days of such decision to the Indian tribe or tribal organization;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide assistance to the Indian tribe or tribal organization to overcome the stated objections;</P>
            <P>(3) Provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under the regulations set forth in subpart L, except that the Indian tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing the appeal, initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed directly under section 110(a) of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>May the Indian tribe or tribal organization elect to use a grant in lieu of a contract?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes. A grant agreement or a cooperative agreement may be used in lieu of a contract under sections 102 and 103 of the Act when agreed to by the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Under the grant concept, the grantee will assume full responsibility and accountability for design and construction performance within the funding limitations. The grantee will manage and administer the work with minimal involvement by the government. The grantee will be expected to have acceptable management systems for finance, procurement, and property. The Secretary may issue Federal construction guidelines and manuals applicable to its construction programs, and the government shall accept tribal proposals for alternatives which are consistent with or exceed Federal guidelines or manuals applicable to construction programs.</P>

            <P>(a) Throughout the contract award process, the Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization shall share all construction project cost information available to them in order to facilitate reaching agreement on an overall fair and reasonable price for the project or part thereof. In order to enhance this communication, the government's estimate of an overall fair and reasonable price shall:</P>

            <P>(2) Be prepared in a format coordinated with the Indian tribe or tribal organization; and</P>
            <P>(3) Include the cost elements contained in section 105(m)(4) of the Act.</P>

The objective of the negotiations is to arrive at an amount that is fair under current market conditions and reasonable to both the government and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. As a result, the agreement does not necessarily have to be in strict conformance with either party's cost estimate nor does agreement have to be reached on every element of cost, but only on the overall fair and reasonable price of each phase of the work included in the contract.</P>

            <P>(a) A schedule for advance payments shall be developed based on progress, need, and other considerations in accordance with applicable law. The payment schedule shall be negotiated by the parties and included in the contract. The payment schedule may be adjusted as negotiated by the parties during the course of the project based on progress and need.</P>
            <P>(b) Payments shall be made to the Indian tribe or tribal organization according to the payment schedule contained in the contract.

Each allocation shall be adequate to provide funds for the contract activities anticipated to be conducted during the allocation period, except that:</P>
            <P>(1) The first allocation may be greater than subsequent allocations and include mobilization costs, and contingency funds described in § 900.128(e)(8); and</P>

Upon award of the contract, the Secretary shall transfer the amount of the first allocation to the Indian tribe or tribal organization within 21 days after the date of contract award. The second allocation shall be made not later than 7 days before the end of the first allocation period.</P>
            <P>(e) Not later than 7 days before the end of each subsequent allocation period after the second allocation, the Secretary shall transfer to the Indian tribe or tribal organization the amount for the next allocation period, unless the Indian tribe or tribal organization is delinquent in submission of allocation period progress reports and financial reports or the Secretary takes action to suspend or terminate the contract in accordance with § 900.131(b)(11), § 900.131(b)(12), or § 900.131(b)(13).</P>

If you advise the awarding official in writing that you do want a decision within 60 days, the awarding official shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he or she receives your written notice.</P>
            <P>(c) If your claim is for $100,000 or less and you do not advise the awarding official that you want a decision within 60 days, or if your claim exceeds $100,000 and the awarding official has notified you of the time within which a decision will be issued, the awarding official shall issue a decision within a reasonable time.

            <P>Yes. Once the awarding official decides that money should be paid under the contract, the amount due, minus any portion already paid, should be paid as promptly as possible, without waiting for either party to file an appeal.

Once the decision has been made, the awarding official may not change it, except by agreement of the parties, or under the following limited circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) If evidence is discovered which could not have been discovered through due diligence before the awarding official issued the decision;</P>

The interest will be calculated from the date the awarding official receives the claim until the day it is paid. The interest rate will be the rate which the Secretary of the Treasury sets for the Renegotiation Board under the Renegotiation Act of 1951, Public Law 92-41, 26 U.S.C. 1212 and 26 U.S.C. 7447.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Information Collection.</E> The information provided by the Tribes will be used by the Department for a variety of purposes. The first purpose will be to ensure that qualified applicants are admitted into the applicant pool consistent with the requirements of the Act. In addition, Tribes seeking grant assistance to meet the planning requirements for admission into the applicant pool, will provide information so that grants can be awarded to Tribes meeting basic eligibility (<E T="03">i.e.</E> Tribal resolution indicating that the Tribe wants to plan for Self-Governance and has no material audit exceptions for the last three years of audits). There is no confidential information being solicited and confidentiality is not extended under the law. Other documentation is required to meet the reporting requirements as called for in section 405 of the Act. The information being provided by the Tribes is required to obtain a benefit, however, no person is required to respond to an information collection request unless the form or regulation requesting the information has a currently valid OMB control (clearance) number. Comments were solicited from the Tribes and the general public with respect to this collection. No adverse comments were received. The information collection has been cleared by OMB. The number is OMB control #1076-0143. The approval expires on April 30, 2003.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy statement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Congressional findings.</E> In the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, the Congress found that:</P>
            <P>(1) The Tribal right of self-governance flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian Tribes and nations;</P>
            <P>(2) The United States recognizes a special government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes, including the right of the Tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of dealings of the United States with Indian Tribes;</P>
            <P>(3) Although progress had been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, had eroded Tribal self-governance and dominated Tribal affairs;</P>

            <P>(4) The Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between <PRTPAGE P="396"/>Indian Tribes and the United States and to strengthen Tribal control over Federal funding and program management; and</P>
            <P>(5) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance demonstration project and finds that:</P>
            <P>(i) Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon Tribal request, for Federal programs is an effective way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian Tribes; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon request, for Federal programs strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Congressional declaration of policy.</E> It is the policy of the Tribal Self-Governance Act to permanently establish and implement self-governance:</P>
            <P>(1) To enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian Tribes;</P>
            <P>(2) To permit each Tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance;</P>
            <P>(3) To coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;</P>
            <P>(4) To ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and Indian individuals;</P>
            <P>(5) To permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian Tribes with meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the needs of the individual Tribal communities; and</P>
            <P>(6) To provide for an orderly transition through a planned and measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Secretarial self-governance policies.</E> (1) It is the policy of the Secretary to fully support and implement the foregoing policies to the full extent of the Secretary's authority.</P>
            <P>(2) It is the policy of the Secretary to recognize and respect the unique government-to-government relationship between Tribes, as sovereign governments, and the United States.</P>
            <P>(3) It is the policy of the Secretary to have all bureaus of the Department work cooperatively and pro-actively with Tribes and Tribal Consortia on a government-to-government basis within the framework of the Act and any other applicable provision of law, so as to make the ideals of self-determination and self-governance a reality.</P>
            <P>(4) It is the policy of the Secretary to have all bureaus of the Department actively share information with Tribes and Tribal Consortia to encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to become knowledgeable about the Department's programs and the opportunities to include them in an annual funding agreement.</P>
            <P>(5) It is the policy of the Secretary that all bureaus of the Department will negotiate in good faith, interpret each applicable Federal law and regulation in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of programs in each annual funding agreement authorized, and enter into such annual funding agreements under Title IV, whenever possible.</P>
            <P>(6) It is the policy of the Secretary to afford Tribes and Tribal Consortia the maximum flexibility and discretion necessary to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious, and institutional needs. These policies are designed to facilitate and encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs, included, or eligible for inclusion in an annual funding agreement.</P>
            <P>(7) It is the policy of the Secretary, to the extent of the Secretary's authority, to maintain active communication with Tribal governments regarding budgetary matters applicable to programs subject to the Act, and that are included in an individual self-governance annual funding agreement.</P>

            <P>(8) It is the policy of the Secretary to implement policies, procedures, and practices at the Department to ensure that the letter, spirit, and goals of the Tribal Self-Governance Act are fully and successfully implemented.<PRTPAGE P="397"/>
            </P>
            <P>(9) Executive Order 13084 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and any subsequent Executive Orders regarding consultation will apply to the implementation of these regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) Generally, residual information will be determined through a process that is consistent with the overall process used by the BIA. Residual information will consist of residual functions performed by the BIA, brief justification why the function is not compactible, and the estimated funding level for each residual function. Each regional office and the central office will compile a single document for distribution each year that contains all the residual information of that respective office. The development of the residual information will be based on the following principles. The BIA will:</P>
              <P>(1) Develop uniform residual information to be used to negotiate residuals;</P>
              <P>(2) Ensure functional consistency throughout BIA in the determination of residuals;</P>
              <P>(3) Make the determination of residuals based upon the functions actually being performed by BIA at the respective office;</P>
              <P>(4) Annually consult with Tribes on a region-by-region basis as requested by Tribes/Consortia; and</P>
              <P>(5) Notify Tribal leaders each year by March 1 of the availability of residual information.</P>
              <P>(b) BIA shall use the residual information determined under subparagraph (a) as the basis for negotiating with individual Tribes.</P>
              <P>(c) In accordance with the appeals procedures in subpart R of this part, if BIA and a participating Tribe/Consortium disagree over the content of residual functions or amounts, Tribe/Consortium can appeal as shown in the following table.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does BIA determine a Tribe's/Consortium's share of funds to be included in an AFA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>There are typically two methods for determining the amount of funds to be included in the AFA:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Formula-driven.</E> For formula-driven programs, a Tribe's/Consortium's amount is determined by first identifying the residual funds to be retained by BIA and second, by applying the distribution formula to the remaining eligible funding for each program involved.</P>
              <P>(1) Distribution formulas must be reasonably related to the function or service performed by an office, and must be consistently applied to all Tribes within each regional and agency office.</P>
              <P>(2) The process in paragraph (a) of this section for calculating a Tribe's funding under self-governance must be consistent with the process used for calculating funds available to non-self-governance Tribes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tribal-specific.</E> For programs whose funds are not distributed on a formula basis as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a Tribe's funding amount will be determined on a Tribe-by-Tribe basis and may differ between Tribes. Examples of these funds may include special project funding, awarded competitive grants, earmarked funding, and construction or other one-time or non-recurring funding for which a Tribe is eligible.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are self-governance base budgets?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Tribe/Consortium self-governance base budget is the amount of recurring funding identified in the President's annual budget request to Congress. This amount must be adjusted to reflect subsequent Congressional action. It includes amounts that are eligible to be base transferred or have been base transferred from BIA budget accounts to self-governance budget accounts. As allowed by Congress, self-governance base budgets are derived from:</P>
              <P>(1) A Tribe's/Consortium's Pub. L. 93-638 contract amounts;</P>
              <P>(2) Negotiated agency, regional, and central office amounts;</P>
              <P>(3) Other recurring funding;</P>

              <P>(6) Tribal priority allocation increases and decreases;</P>
              <P>(7) Pay costs and retirement cost adjustments; and</P>
              <P>(8) Any other inflationary cost adjustments.</P>
              <P>(b) Self-governance base budgets must not include any non-recurring program funds, construction and wildland firefighting accounts, Congressional earmarks, or other funds specifically excluded by Congress. These funds are negotiated annually and may be included in the AFA but must not be included in the self-governance base budget.</P>
              <P>(c) Self-governance base budgets may not include other recurring type programs that are currently in Tribal priority allocations (TPA) such as general assistance, housing improvement program (HIP), road maintenance and contract support. Should these later four programs ever become base transferred to Tribes, then they may be included in a self-governance Tribe's base budget.</P>

              <P>(a) It must negotiate all funding levels in the AFA using the process for determining residuals and funding amounts on the same basis as other Tribes; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Allowable indirect costs.</P>
              <P>(2) A bureau is not required to include management and support funds from the regional or central office level in an AFA, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The Tribe/Consortium will perform work previously performed at the regional or central office level;</P>
              <P>(ii) The work is not compensated in the indirect cost rate; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Funding Limitations.</E> The amount of funding must be subject to the availability and level of Congressional appropriations to the bureau for that program or activity. As the various bureaus use somewhat differing budgeting practices, determining the amount of funds available for inclusion in the AFA for a particular program or activity is likely to vary among bureaus or programs.</P>

              <P>No, the established indirect cost rates will not always apply to new AFAs.</P>
              <P>(a) A Tribe's/Consortium's existing indirect cost rate should be reviewed and renegotiated with the inspector general or other cognizant agency if:</P>
              <P>(1) Using the previously negotiated rate would include the recovery of indirect costs that are not reasonable, allocable, or allowable to the relevant program; or</P>
              <P>(2) The previously negotiated rate would result in an under-recovery by the Tribe/Consortium.</P>
              <P>(b) If a Tribe/Consortium has a fixed amount indirect cost agreement under OMB Circular A-87, then:</P>
              <P>(1) Renegotiation is not required and the duration of the fixed amount agreement will be that provided for in the fixed amount agreement; or</P>
              <P>(2) The Tribe/Consortium and bureau may negotiate an indirect cost amount or rate for use only in that AFA without the involvement of the inspector general or other cognizant agency.</P>

              <P>The Secretary determines the amount of indirect contract support costs by:</P>
              <P>(a) Applying the negotiated indirect cost rate to the appropriate direct cost base;</P>
              <P>(b) Using the provisional rate; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is there a predetermined cap or limit on indirect cost rates or a fixed formula for calculating indirect cost rates?</SUBJECT>
              <P>No, indirect cost rates vary from Tribe to Tribe. The Secretary should refer to the appropriate negotiated indirect cost rates for individual Tribes, that apply government-wide. Although this cost rate is not capped, the amount of funds available for inclusion is capped at the level available under the relevant appropriation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Instead of the negotiated indirect cost rate, is it possible to establish a fixed amount or another negotiated rate for indirect costs where funds are limited?</SUBJECT>

              <P>Yes, OMB Circular A-87 encourages agencies to test fee-for-service alternatives. If the parties agree to a fixed price, fee-for-service agreement, then they must use OMB Circular A-87 as a guide in determining the appropriate price (OMB circulars are available at <E T="03">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/</E> or see 5 CFR 1310.3). Where limited appropriated funds are available, negotiating the fixed cost option or another rate may facilitate reaching an agreement with that Tribe/Consortium.</P>

During this extension period, the current AFA shall remain in effect, including coverage of the Tribe/Consortium under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680 (1994); and the Tribe/Consortium may use any funds remaining under the AFA, savings from other programs or Tribal funds to carry out the program. Nothing in this section authorizes an AFA to be continued beyond the completion of the program authorized under the AFA or the amended AFA. This section also does not entitle a Tribe/Consortium to receive, nor does it prevent a Tribe from receiving, additional funding under any successor AFA. The successor AFA must provide funding to the Tribe/Consortium at a level necessary for the Tribe/Consortium to perform the programs, functions, services, and activities (PFSA) or portions thereof for the full period they were or will be performed.</P>

              <P>A self-governance compact is an executed document that affirms the government-to-government relationship between a self-governance Tribe and the United States.

              <P>(a) Yes, all provisions in compacts that were negotiated with BIA before January 16, 2001, shall remain in effect for BIA programs only after January 16, 2001, provided that each compact contains provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) That are authorized by the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994;</P>
              <P>(2) Are in compliance with other applicable Federal laws; and,</P>

BIA and the Tribe/Consortium will renegotiate the provision within 60 days of the Tribe's/Consortium's receipt of the notification.</P>
              <P>(c) If renegotiation is not successful within 60 days of the notice being provided, BIA's determination is final for the bureau and enforceability of the provisions shall be subject to the appeals process described in subpart R of this part. Pending a final appeal through the appeals process, BIA's determination shall be stayed.</P>

              <P>(a) Each year the Secretary's designated representative(s) will conduct trust evaluations for each self-governance AFA. The Secretary's designated representative(s) will coordinate with the designated Tribe's/Consortium's <PRTPAGE P="432"/>representative(s) throughout the review process, including the written report required by § 1000.365.</P>
              <P>(b) This section describes the general framework for trust reviews. However, each Tribe/Consortium may develop, with the appropriate bureau, an individualized trust evaluation process to allow for the Tribe's/Consortium's unique history and circumstances and the terms and conditions of its AFA. An individualized trust evaluation process must, at a minimum, contain the measures in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) To facilitate the review process so as to mitigate costs and maximize efficiency, each Tribe/Consortium must provide access to all records, plans, and other pertinent documents relevant to the program(s) under review not otherwise available to the Department.</P>
              <P>(d) The Secretary's designated representative(s) will:</P>
              <P>(1) Review trust transactions;</P>
              <P>(2) Conduct on-site inspections of trust resources, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(3) Review compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements;</P>
              <P>(4) Review compliance with the trust provisions of the AFA;</P>
              <P>(5) Ensure that the same level of trust services is provided to individual Indians as would have been provided by the Secretary;</P>
              <P>(6) Document deficiencies in the performance of trust functions discovered during the review process; and</P>
              <P>(7) Ensure the fulfillment of the Secretary's trust responsibility to Tribes and individual Indians by documenting the existence of:</P>
              <P>(i) Systems of internal controls;</P>
              <P>(ii) Trust standards; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Safeguards against conflicts of interest in the performance of trust functions.</P>
              <P>(e) At the request of a Tribe/Consortium, at the time the AFA is negotiated, the standards will be negotiated, except where standards are otherwise provided for by law.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon Tribal/Consortium request, the representative(s) will provide the Tribal/Consortium representative(s) with a copy of the report for review and comment before finalization.</P>
              <P>(b) The representative(s) will attach to the report any Tribal/Consortium comments that the representative does not accept.</P>

              <P>No, Tribes/Consortia are under the same obligation as the Secretary to perform trust functions and related activities in accordance with trust protection standards and principles whether managing Tribally or individually owned trust assets. The process for conducting annual trust evaluations of Tribal performance of trust functions on behalf of individual Indians is the same as that used in evaluating performance of Tribal trust functions.</P>

              <P>Yes, if the annual evaluation reveals that deficient performance of a trust <PRTPAGE P="433"/>function is due to the action or inaction of a bureau, the evaluation report will note the deficiency and the appropriate Department official will be notified of the need for corrective action. The review of the Secretary's trust functions shall be based on the standards in this subpart, other applicable law, and other Federal law.</P>

              <P>(a) A finding of imminent jeopardy triggers the Federal reassumption process (see subpart M of this part), unless the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(b) The reassumption process will not be triggered if the Secretary's designated representative determines that the Tribe/Consortium:</P>
              <P>(1) Can cure the conditions causing jeopardy within 60 days; and</P>
              <P>(2) Will not cause significant loss, harm, or devaluation of a trust asset, natural resources, or the public health and safety.</P>

When the Department receives information of a threat of imminent jeopardy to a trust asset, natural resource, or the public health and safety, the Secretary, as trustee, may conduct a preliminary investigation. If the preliminary investigation shows that appropriate, sufficient data are present to indicate there may be imminent jeopardy, the Secretary's designated representative:</P>
              <P>(a) Will notify the Tribe/Consortium in writing; and</P>
              <P>(b) May conduct an on-site inspection upon 2 days' advance written notice to the Tribe/Consortium.</P>

            <P>(b) This compact is to enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with and responsibility to the Tribe through Tribal self-governance, so that the Tribe may take its rightful place in the family of governments; remove Federal obstacles to effective self-governance; reorganize Tribal government programs and services; achieve efficiencies in service delivery; and provide a documented example for the development of future Federal Indian policy. This policy of Tribal self-governance shall permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of Indian programs and services to allow Indian Tribes meaningful authority to plan, conduct, and administer those programs and services to meet the needs of their people. In implementing Self-Governance, the Bureau of Indian Affairs is expected to provide the same level of service to other Tribal governments and to demonstrate new policies and methods to improve service delivery and address Tribal needs. In fulfilling its responsibilities under the compact, the Secretary hereby pledges that the Department will conduct all relations with the Tribe on a government-to-government basis.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Availability, amount, and number of planning and negotiation grants.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) What is the purpose of this section? This section describes how to apply for planning and negotiation grants authorized by section 402(d) of the Act to help meet tribal costs incurred:</P>
          <P>(1) In meeting the planning phase requirement of Pub. L. 103-413, including planning to negotiate non-BIA programs, services, functions and activities; and</P>
          <P>(2) In conducting negotiations.</P>
          <P>(b) What types of grants are available? Three categories of grants may be available:</P>
          <P>(1) Negotiation grants for tribes/consortia selected from the applicant pool as described in § 1001.5 of these regulations;</P>
          <P>(2) Planning grants for tribes/consortia requiring advance funding to meet the planning phase requirement of Pub. L. 103-413; and</P>
          <P>(3) Financial assistance for tribes/consortia to plan for negotiating for non-BIA programs, services, functions and activities, as described in § 1001.10.</P>

          <P>(c) Will grants always be made available to meet the planning phase requirement as described in section 402(d) of Pub. L. 103-413? No. Grants to cover some or all of the planning costs that a tribe/consortium may incur may be made available depending upon the availability of funds appropriated by Congress. We will publish notice of availability of grants in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as described in this section.</P>
          <P>(d) May a tribe use its own resources to meet its planning and negotiation expenses in preparation for entering into self-governance? Yes. A tribe/consortium may use its own resources to meet these costs. Receiving a grant is not necessary to meet the planning phase requirement of the Act or to negotiate a compact and annual funding agreement.</P>

          <P>(e) What happens if there are insufficient funds to meet the anticipated tribal requests for planning and negotiation grants in any given year? If appropriated funds are available but insufficient to meet the total requests from tribes/consortia, we will give first <PRTPAGE P="445"/>priority to those that have been selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an annual funding agreement. We will give second priority to tribes/consortia that require advance funds to meet the planning requirement for entry into the self-governance program. We will give third priority to tribes/consortia that require negotiation/planning funds to negotiate for DOI non-BIA programs.</P>

          <P>(f) How many grants will the Department make each year and what funding will be available? The number and size of grants awarded each year will depend on Congressional appropriations and tribal interest. Each year, we will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> which provides relevant details about the application process, including: The funds available, timeframes, and requirements for negotiation and advance planning specified in this part.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Selection criteria for tribes/consortia to receive a negotiation grant.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Who may be selected to receive a negotiation grant? Any tribe/consortium that has been accepted into the applicant pool in accordance with § 1001.5 and has been selected to negotiate a self-governance annual funding agreement is eligible to apply for a negotiation grant. Each year, we will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> with all relevant details as to how tribes/consortia which have been selected can apply for negotiation grants.</P>
          <P>(b) What must a tribe/consortium do to receive a negotiation grant?</P>
          <P>(1) To receive a negotiation grant, a tribe/consortium must:</P>
          <P>(i) Be selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an annual funding agreement;</P>
          <P>(ii) Be identified as eligible to receive a negotiation grant; and</P>

          <P>(iii) Not have received a negotiation grant within the 3 years preceding the date of the latest <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcement described in § 1001.7.</P>
          <P>(2) The tribe/consortium must submit a letter affirming its readiness to negotiate and formally request a negotiation grant to prepare for and negotiate a self-governance agreement. These grants are not competitive.</P>
          <P>(c) May a selected tribe negotiate without applying for a negotiation grant? Yes. In this case, the tribe should notify us in writing so that funds can be reallocated for other grants.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Selection criteria for tribes/consortia seeking advance planning grant funding.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Who is eligible to apply for a planning grant that will be awarded before a tribe/consortium is admitted into the applicant pool? Any tribe/consortium that is not a self-governance tribe and needs advance funding in order to complete the planning phase requirement may apply. Tribes/consortia that have received a planning grant within 3 years preceding the date of the latest <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcement described in § 1001.7 are not eligible.</P>
          <P>(b) What must a tribe/consortium seeking a planning grant submit in order to meet the planning phase requirements? A tribe/consortium must submit the following material:</P>
          <P>(1) A tribal resolution or other final action of the tribal governing body indicating a desire to plan for tribal self-governance;</P>
          <P>(2) Audits from the last 3 years which document that the tribe meets the requirement of being free from any material audit exception;</P>
          <P>(3) A proposal that describes the tribe's/consortium's plans to conduct:</P>
          <P>(i) Legal and budgetary research, and</P>
          <P>(ii) Internal tribal government and organization planning;</P>
          <P>(4) A timeline indicating when planning will start and end; and</P>
          <P>(5) Evidence that the tribe/consortium can perform the tasks associated with its proposal (i.e., submit resumes and position descriptions of key staff or consultants to be used).</P>

          <P>(c) How will tribes/consortia know when and how to apply for planning grants? Each year, we will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of the availability of planning grants for additional tribes as described in § 1001.7. This notice will identify the specific details for applying.<PRTPAGE P="446"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) What criteria will be used to award planning grants to those tribes/consortia requiring advance funding to meet the planning phase requirement of Public Law 103-413? Advance planning grants are discretionary and based on need. The following criteria will be used to determine whether to award a planning grant to a tribe/consortium before the tribe is being selected into the applicant pool:</P>
          <P>(1) A complete application as described in §§ 1001.9(b) and 1001.9(c);</P>
          <P>(2) A demonstration of financial need. We will rank applications according to the percentage of tribal resources to total resources as indicated in the latest A-128 audit. We will give priority to applications that demonstrate financial need by having a lower level of tribal resources as a percent of total resources; and</P>
          <P>(3) Other factors that demonstrate the readiness of the tribe/consortium to enter into a self-governance agreement, including previous efforts of the tribe/consortium to participate in self-governance.</P>
          <P>(e) Can tribes/consortia that receive advance planning grants also apply for a negotiation grant? Yes. Tribes/consortia that receive advance planning grants may submit a completed application to be included in the applicant pool. Once approved for inclusion in the applicant pool, the tribe/consortium may apply for a negotiation grant according to the process identified in § 1001.7 above.</P>
          <P>(f) When and how will a tribe/consortium know whether it has been selected to receive an advance planning grant? Within 30 days of the deadline for submitting applications we will notify the tribe/consortium by letter whether it has been selected to receive an advance planning grant.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Selection criteria for other planning and negotiating financial assistance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) What is the purpose of this section? This section describes how to apply for other financial assistance for planning and negotiating of a DOI non-BIA program, service, function or activity that may be available, as well as the selection process.</P>
          <P>(b) Are there other funds that may be available to self-governance tribes/consortia for planning and negotiating with DOI non-BIA bureaus? Yes. Tribes/consortia may contact the Director, Office of Self-Governance to determine if funds are available for the purpose of planning and negotiating with DOI non-BIA bureaus under this section. A tribe/consortium may also request information from a DOI non-BIA bureau on any funds which may be available from that bureau.</P>
          <P>(c) Who is eligible to apply for financial assistance to plan and negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program? Any existing self-governance tribe/consortium is eligible.</P>
          <P>(d) Under what circumstances may planning and negotiation financial assistance be made available to tribes/consortia? At the discretion of the Director, grants may be awarded when requested by the tribe and coordinated with the DOI non-BIA agency involved.</P>

          <P>(e) How does the tribe/consortium apply for a grant to plan and negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program? When such funds are available, we will publish a notice of their availability and a deadline for submitting applications for such grants in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as indicated in § 1001.7.</P>
          <P>(f) What must be included in the application? The application must include the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The tribal resolution or other final action of the tribal governing body indicating that the tribe/consortium intends to negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program;</P>
          <P>(2) A copy of the proposal or summary that was submitted to the DOI non-BIA bureau;</P>
          <P>(3) A time line indicating when planning will begin and end;</P>
          <P>(4) The planning resources from all other sources that are approved and/or anticipated for the planning activity; and</P>
          <P>(5) The amount requested and a justification of why it is needed by the tribe/consortium.</P>

          <P>(g) What criteria will we use to award grants to those tribes/consortia requesting financial assistance to plan and negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program? The award of such grants is discretionary. After consulting with the <PRTPAGE P="447"/>requesting tribe/consortium and the appropriate DOI non-BIA bureau, the Director will determine whether to award a grant to plan and negotiate for a DOI non-BIA program. The determination will be based upon the complexity of the project, the availability of resources from all other sources, and the relative need of the tribe/consortium to receive such funds for the successful completion of the planning and negotiating activity, as determined by the percentage of tribal resources to total resources as indicated in the latest A-128 audit. All decisions to award or not to award grants as described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section are final for the Department.</P>

            <P>This part describes the processes by which Indian tribes can manage tribal funds currently held in trust by the United States. It defines how tribes may withdraw their funds from trust status; how they may return funds to trust; and how they may request technical assistance or grants to help prepare plans to manage funds or to ensure the capability to manage those funds.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1200.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the Department's policy on tribal management of trust funds?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) We will give tribes as much responsibility as they desire for the management of their tribal funds that we currently hold in trust.</P>
            <P>(b) Title II of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, implemented by these regulations, offers tribes one approach for assuming increased management of their funds that we now hold in trust and administer. Under title II, a tribe may completely remove its funds from Federal trust status and manage them as it wishes, subject to the requirements and conditions in this part. When a tribe withdraws its funds under this part, it may invest those funds in equities or other investment vehicles that are statutorily unavailable to us.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1200.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>May tribes exercise increased direction over their trust funds and retain the protections of Federal trust status?</SUBJECT>

            <P>Yes. The Tribal Self-Governance Act (25 U.S.C. 458) and the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) provide other options for trust funds management. A tribe may choose to manage its trust funds under the provisions of these Acts if it wishes. These options are covered by 25 CFR part 900 (the “Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act Program”) and 25 CFR part 1000 (the “Self-Governance Program”).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the advantages and disadvantages of managing trust funds under the options in § 1200.4?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Under these other options, the funds remain in Federal trust status and the tribe can exercise a range of control over their management. However, the tribe has fewer investment options than it has when it withdraws its funds completely from trust status. If a tribe chooses to keep its funds in trust status, the tribe is subject to the same statutory investment restrictions that bind us. That means that the tribe's investments are limited to bank deposits and securities guaranteed by the United States. (See 25 U.S.C. 162a for specific statutory investment restrictions.)</P>

            <P>(a) The information collection requirements contained in subpart B of this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and assigned OMB Control Number 1035-0003.

            <P>(c) Information collected in § 1200.43, (How can a tribe apply for technical assistance?) will be used to determine the eligibility of applicants, as well as the level of need for technical assistance, in order for tribes to develop Management Plans and to complete the application for withdrawal process.</P>

            <P>(a) A tribe may withdraw funds appropriated to satisfy judgments of the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) and the Court of Federal Claims and that we hold under the Indian Judgment Funds Use and Distributions Act (25 U.S.C. 1401) or another act of Congress if:</P>
            <P>(1) The tribe uses the funds as specified in the previously approved judgment fund plan, and;</P>
            <P>(2) The tribe withdraws only funds held for Indian tribes and does not include any funds held for individual tribal members.</P>
            <P>(b) A tribe may withdraw funds appropriated to satisfy settlement agreements relating to certain tribal claims and that we hold and manage for the tribe pursuant to an act of Congress if:</P>
            <P>(1) The tribe uses the funds as specified in the previously approved settlement act plan;</P>
            <P>(2) The tribe withdraws only funds held for Indian tribes and does not include any funds held for individual tribal members; and</P>
            <P>(3) It is determined that there is no provision in the act or settlement agreement requiring that the funds remain in trust to implement the act or agreement that cannot be waived.</P>
            <P>(c) Tribal funds commonly known as “Proceeds of Labor” funds, usually income to trust resources, are generally withdrawn under normal tribal budgeting procedures, but may also be withdrawn from trust under this part. These funds may be returned to trust under the provisions of subpart C of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does a tribe apply to withdraw funds?</SUBJECT>
            <P>To withdraw funds, a tribe must submit four copies of its application and the attachments listed in this section to: Director, Office of External Affairs, Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, Department of the Interior, MS-5140, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. We will notify the tribe if the application is incomplete and will help the tribe complete the application if requested.

Each application package must contain the items listed below.</P>

Notification must be by the method(s) that the tribe customarily uses to notify its members of significant tribal actions. The notification must identify the specific funds to be withdrawn.</P>
            <P>(b) A tribal resolution that:</P>

            <P>(1) Expressly authorizes the withdrawal of the funds and indicates the <PRTPAGE P="454"/>(approximate) dollar amount of the funds to be withdrawn;</P>
            <P>(2) Expressly acknowledges that the funds, once withdrawn in accordance with the Act, will no longer be held in trust status by the United States, and that we have no further liability or responsibility for the funds; and</P>
            <P>(3) Acknowledges that:</P>
            <P>(i) Neither we nor the tribe necessarily accept the account balances at the time of withdrawal as accurate; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Neither we nor the tribe have waived any rights regarding the balances, including the right to seek compensation for incorrect balances.</P>
            <P>(c) A copy of a formal agreement between the tribe and the manager of the funds to be withdrawn, in which the manager agrees to:</P>
            <P>(1) Comply with the terms of the plan we approve under § 1200.15 and make only those changes that conform to revision procedures in the approved plan and the requirements of § 1200.19; and</P>
            <P>(2) Transfer funds to the tribe or another manager only after receiving a valid tribal resolution calling for this transfer and proof that the tribe has notified its members of intent to transfer the funds. The resolution must clearly state that:</P>
            <P>(i) The funds are being withdrawn to be reinvested by the tribe in a manner consistent with the goals and strategies of the approved plan; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The fund managers will continue to follow any previously approved distribution plan conditions.</P>

            <P>(2) The tribal governing body has the legal authority to withdraw funds from trust status and that the withdrawal does not require a referendum vote or other procedure beyond a tribal council resolution; and</P>
            <P>(3) If the funds to be withdrawn are judgment or settlement funds, that the tribe's plan for managing the funds meets the requirements of any applicable judgment fund use and distribution plan or settlement act.</P>
            <P>(e) The results of a tribal referendum, if one was held.</P>
            <P>(f) If the funds to be withdrawn are judgment or settlement funds, a copy of the act and/or plan that sets out the conditions for the uses of the funds or income from them.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What criteria will be used in evaluating the management plan?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Each plan must be approved by the appropriate tribal governing body, and must be accompanied by a resolution approving the plan. The plan must be reasonable in light of the trust responsibility and the principles of Indian self-determination, and other appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, the factors listed below:</P>
            <P>(a) We will evaluate the individuals or entities that will manage the funds to be withdrawn, or that will advise the tribe on investing the funds to be withdrawn in order to determine if they have the capability and experience to manage the funds. Among the elements we will evaluate are: the number of years in business, the performance record for funds management, and the ability to compensate the tribe if the entity is found liable for failing to comply with the tribe's management plan (i.e., its assets, bonding, and insurance).</P>
            <P>(b) We will review the tribe's experience in managing investments. We will compare this experience to the complexity of the proposed management plan to determine whether the tribe has the experience to manage its proposed plan or whether it should begin with a less complex approach.</P>
            <P>(c) We will evaluate the tribe's internal audit and control systems for overseeing or monitoring its investment activity.</P>
            <P>(d) We will evaluate the adequacy of protection against substantial loss of principal. Our determination will include a thorough evaluation of the tribe's investment plan including:</P>
            <P>(1) The goals and objectives;</P>
            <P>(2) The proposed uses of the fund in order to meet business objectives;</P>
            <P>(3) The size and diversity of the investment portfolio (for example, the class of stocks and the mixture of types of investments);</P>
            <P>(4) The financial condition of the tribe;</P>
            <P>(5) The inherent riskiness of the proposed investments; and</P>
            <P>(6) The tribe's projected need and proposed timeframes to draw down the funds being invested or the income from them.</P>
            <P>(e) We will determine the likelihood that the plan will be followed. We will base this determination on the contents of the agreement between the tribe and the fund manager and other appropriate factors.</P>

            <P>Once a tribe has withdrawn its funds, the tribe may revise its plan without our approval. All revisions should conform to the procedures outlined in the approved management plan. The tribe should inform its members of all revisions to a plan through normal tribal procedures before the revisions are implemented.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(1) Notify us of the additional amount it intends to withdraw and whether the funds to be withdrawn are in kind or cash. (Written notification should be provided to our address in § 1200.13);</P>
            <P>(2) Send us a tribal resolution approving the new withdrawal and certifying that the funds are being withdrawn subject to the same conditions and that they will be managed under the plan in the original approved application;</P>
            <P>(3) Send us a copy of the most recent compliance audit or investment report.</P>
            <P>(b) After we finish our review we will release the additional funds, unless the compliance audit or investment report indicates that the tribe is not complying with its management plan. In this case, we will not release the additional funds until the tribe demonstrates that it is complying with the management plan.</P>
