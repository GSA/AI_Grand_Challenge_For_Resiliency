      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) An SHA that uses the proceeds of bonds issued by the State, a county, city or other political subdivision of the State, for the construction of projects on the Federal-aid primary or Interstate system, or extensions of any of the Federal-aid highway systems in urban areas, or for substitute highway projects approved under 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4), may claim payment of any portion of such sums apportioned to it for expenditures on such system to aid in the retirement of the principal of bonds at their maturities, to the extent that the proceeds of bonds have actually been expended in the construction of projects.</P>
              <P>(b) Any interest earned and payable on bonds, the proceeds of which were expended on Interstate projects after November 6, 1978, is an eligible cost of construction. The amount of interest eligible for participation will be based on (1) the date the proceeds were expended on the project, (2) amount expended, and (3) the date of conversion to a regularly funded project. As provided for in section 115(c), Pub. L. 95-599, November 6, 1978, interest on bonds issued in any fiscal year by a State after November 6, 1978, may be paid under the authority of 23 U.S.C. 122 only if such SHA was eligible to obligate Interstate Discretionary funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 118(b) during such fiscal year, and the Administrator certifies that such eligible SHA has utilized, or will utilize to the fullest extent possible during such fiscal year, its authority to obligate funds under 23 U.S.C. 118(b).</P>
              <P>(c) The Federal share payable at the time of conversion, as provided for in § 140.610 shall be the legal pro rata in effect at the time of execution of the project agreement for the bond issue project.</P>
              <P>(d) The authorization of a bond issue project does not constitute a commitment of Federal funds until the project is converted to a regular Federal-aid project as provided for in § 140.610.</P>
              <P>(e) Reimbursements for the redemption of bonds may not precede, by more than 60 days, the scheduled date of the retirement of the bonds.</P>

The cost of labor surcharges will be reimbursed at actual cost to the company or a company may, at its option, use an additive rate or other similar technique in lieu of actual costs provided that (i) the rate is based on historical cost data of the company, (ii) such rate is representative of actual costs incurred, (iii) the rate is adjusted at least annually taking into consideration known anticipated changes and correcting for any over or under applied costs for the preceding period, and (iv) the rate is approved by the SHA and FHWA.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the company is a self-insurer there may be reimbursement:</P>
              <P>(i) At experience rates properly developed from actual costs, not to exceed the rates of a regular insurance company for the class of employment covered, or</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procurement.</E> Materials and supplies, if available, are to be furnished from company stock, except they may be obtained from other sources near the project site when available at less cost. Where not available from company stock, they may be purchased either under competitive bids or existing continuing contracts, under which the lowest available prices are developed.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Materials recovered.</E> (1) Materials recovered from temporary use and accepted for reuse by the company shall be credited to the project at prices charged to the job, less a consideration for loss in service life at 10 percent for <PRTPAGE P="18"/>rails, angle bars, tie plates and metal turnout materials and 15 percent for all other materials. Materials recovered from the permanent facility of the company that are accepted by the company for return to stock shall be credited to the project at current stock prices of such used material.</P>

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Competitive negotiation (qualifications-based selection).</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, contracting agencies shall use the competitive negotiation method for the procurement of engineering and design related services when FAHP funds are involved in the contract, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(A). The solicitation, evaluation, ranking, selection, and negotiation shall comply with the qualifications-based selection procurement procedures for architectural and engineering services codified under 40 U.S.C. 1101-1104, commonly referred to as the Brooks Act. In accordance with the requirements of the Brooks Act, the following procedures shall apply to the competitive negotiation procurement method:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Solicitation.</E> The solicitation process shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-State and out-of-State consultants are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract. Procurement procedures may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested consultants or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding consultants are ranked based on qualifications and a RFP is <PRTPAGE P="24"/>then provided to three or more of the most highly qualified consultants. Minimum qualifications of consultants to perform services under general work categories or areas of expertise may also be assessed through a prequalification process whereby annual statements of qualifications and performance data are encouraged. Regardless of any process utilized for prequalification of consultants or for an initial assessment of a consultant's qualifications under a RFQ, a RFP specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a consultant's specific technical approach and qualifications.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Request for proposal (RFP).</E> The RFP shall provide all information and requirements necessary for interested consultants to provide a response to the RFP and compete for the solicited services. The RFP shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Provide a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the scope of work, technical requirements, and qualifications of consultants necessary for the services to be rendered. To the extent practicable, the scope of work should detail the purpose and description of the project, services to be performed, deliverables to be provided, estimated schedule for performance of the work, and applicable standards, specifications, and policies;</P>
            <P>(B) Identify the requirements for any discussions that may be conducted with three or more of the most highly qualified consultants following submission and evaluation of proposals;</P>
            <P>(C) Identify evaluation factors including their relative weight of importance in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section;</P>
            <P>(D) Specify the contract type and method(s) of payment anticipated to contract for the solicited services in accordance with § 172.9;</P>
            <P>(E) Identify any special provisions or contract requirements associated with the solicited services;</P>
            <P>(F) Require that submission of any requested cost proposals or elements of cost be in a concealed format and separate from technical/qualifications proposals, since these shall not be considered in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase; and</P>
            <P>(G) Provide an estimated schedule for the procurement process and establish a submittal deadline for responses to the RFP that provides sufficient time for interested consultants to receive notice, prepare, and submit a proposal, which except in unusual circumstances shall be not less than 14 calendar days from the date of issuance of the RFP.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Evaluation factors.</E> (A) Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance.</P>
            <P>(B) Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria.</P>
            <P>(C) In-State or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement for the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services.</P>
            <P>(D) The following nonqualifications-based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of 10 percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criteria shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local <PRTPAGE P="25"/>presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant from outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The participation of qualified and certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) subconsultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 CFR part 26 and a contracting agency's FHWA-approved DBE program.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Evaluation, ranking, and selection.</E> (A) The contracting agency shall evaluate consultant proposals based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation.</P>
            <P>(B) Although the contract will be with the consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the consultant and any subconsultants identified within the proposal with respect to the scope of work and established criteria.</P>
            <P>(C) The contracting agency shall specify in the RFP discussion requirements that shall follow submission and evaluation of proposals and based on the size and complexity of the project or as defined in contracting agency written policies and procedures, as specified in § 172.5(c). Discussions, as required by the RFP, may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation/interview and shall be with at least three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP.</P>
            <P>(D) From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which may have been conducted, the contracting agency shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria. In instances where only two qualified consultants respond to the solicitation, the contracting agency may proceed with evaluation and selection if it is determined that the solicitation did not contain conditions or requirements that arbitrarily limited competition. Alternatively, a contracting agency may pursue procurement following the noncompetitive method when competition is determined to be inadequate and it is determined to not be feasible or practical to re-compete under a new solicitation as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.</P>
            <P>(E) Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants.</P>
            <P>(F) The contracting agency shall retain supporting documentation of the solicitation, proposal, evaluation, and selection of the consultant in accordance with this section and the provisions of 2 CFR 200.333.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Negotiation.</E> (A) The process for negotiation of the contract shall comply with the requirements codified in 40 U.S.C. 1104(b) for the order of negotiation.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Independent estimate.</E> Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the contracting agency shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation.</P>
            <P>(C) The contracting agency shall establish elements of contract costs (e.g., indirect cost rates, direct salary or wage rates, fixed fee, and other direct costs) separately in accordance with § 172.11. The use of the independent estimate and determination of cost allowance in accordance with § 172.11 shall ensure contracts for the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost, as specified in 40 U.S.C. 1104(a).</P>

            <P>(D) If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, the contracting agency may consider only the cost proposal of the consultant with which negotiations are initiated. Due to the confidential nature of this data, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(E), <PRTPAGE P="26"/>concealed cost proposals of unsuccessful consultants may be disposed of in accordance with written policies and procedures established under § 172.5(c).</P>
            <P>(E) The contracting agency shall retain documentation of negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR 200.333. This documentation shall include the consultant cost certification and documentation supporting the acceptance of the indirect cost rate to be applied to the contract, as specified in § 172.11(c).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Small purchases.</E> The contracting agency may use the State's small purchase procedures that reflect applicable State laws and regulations for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided the total contract costs do not exceed the Federal simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in 48 CFR 2.101). When a lower threshold for use of small purchase procedures is established in State law, regulation, or policy, the lower threshold shall apply to the use of FAHP funds. The following additional requirements shall apply to the small purchase procurement method:</P>
            <P>(i) The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures.</P>
            <P>(ii) A minimum of three consultants are required to satisfy the adequate number of qualified sources reviewed. In instances where only two qualified consultants respond to the solicitation, the contracting agency may proceed with evaluation and selection if it is determined that the solicitation did not contain conditions or requirements which arbitrarily limited competition. Alternatively, a contracting agency may pursue procurement following the noncompetitive method when competition is determined to be inadequate and it is determined to not be feasible or practical to re compete under a new solicitation as specified in § 172.7(a)(3)(iii)(C).</P>
            <P>(iii) Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with State small purchase procedures; however, the allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(iv) The full amount of any contract modification or amendment that would cause the total contract amount to exceed the established simplified acquisition threshold is ineligible for Federal-aid funding. The FHWA may withdraw all Federal-aid from a contract if it is modified or amended above the applicable established simplified acquisition threshold.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Noncompetitive.</E> The following requirements shall apply to the noncompetitive procurement method:</P>
            <P>(i) A contracting agency may use its own noncompetitive procedures that reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations and conform to applicable Federal requirements.</P>
            <P>(ii) A contracting agency shall establish a process to determine when noncompetitive procedures will be used and shall submit justification to, and receive approval from FHWA before using this form of contracting.</P>
            <P>(iii) A contracting agency may award a contract by noncompetitive procedures under the following limited circumstances:</P>
            <P>(A) The service is available only from a single source;</P>
            <P>(B) There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or</P>
            <P>(C) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate.</P>
            <P>(iv) Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with contracting agency noncompetitive procedures; however, the allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional procurement requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Uniform administrative requirements, cost principles and audit requirements for Federal awards.</E> (i) STAs or other recipients and their subrecipients shall comply with procurement requirements established in State and local laws, regulations, policies, and procedures that are not addressed by or are not in conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations, as specified in 2 CFR part 1201.</P>

            <P>(ii) When State and local procurement laws, regulations, policies, or <PRTPAGE P="27"/>procedures are in conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations, a contracting agency shall comply with Federal requirements to be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement of the associated costs of the services incurred following FHWA authorization, as specified in 2 CFR 200.102(c).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program.</E> (i) A contracting agency shall give consideration to DBE consultants in the procurement of engineering and design related service contracts subject to 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2) in accordance with 49 CFR part 26. When DBE program participation goals cannot be met through race-neutral measures, additional DBE participation on engineering and design related services contracts may be achieved in accordance with a contracting agency's FHWA approved DBE program through either:</P>
            <P>(A) Use of an evaluation criterion in the qualifications-based selection of consultants, as specified in § 172.7(a)(1)(iii)(D); or</P>
            <P>(B) Establishment of a contract participation goal.</P>
            <P>(ii) The use of quotas or exclusive set-asides for DBE consultants is prohibited, as specified in 49 CFR 26.43.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Suspension and debarment.</E> A contracting agency shall verify suspension and debarment actions and eligibility status of consultants and subconsultants prior to entering into an agreement or contract in accordance with 2 CFR part 1200 and 2 CFR part 180.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (i) A contracting agency shall maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of engineering and design related services contracts under this part and governing the conduct and roles of consultants in the performance of services under such contracts to prevent, identify, and mitigate conflicts of interest in accordance with 2 CFR 200.112, 23 CFR 1.33 and the provisions of this paragraph (b)(4).</P>
            <P>(ii) No employee, officer, or agent of the contracting agency shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal-aid funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict arises when there is a financial or other interest in the consultant selected for award by:</P>
            <P>(A) The employee, officer, or agent;</P>
            <P>(B) Any member of his or her immediate family;</P>
            <P>(C) His or her partner; or</P>
            <P>(D) An organization that employs or is about to employ any of the above.</P>
            <P>(iii) The contracting agency's officers, employees, or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from consultants, potential consultants, or parties to subagreements. A contracting agency may establish dollar thresholds where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value.</P>
            <P>(iv) A contracting agency may provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.</P>
            <P>(v) To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, the standards of conduct required by this paragraph shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the contracting agency's officers, employees, or agents, or by consultants or their agents.</P>
            <P>(vi) A contracting agency shall promptly disclose in writing any potential conflict of interest to FHWA.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Consultant services in management support roles.</E> (i) When FAHP funds participate in a consultant services contract, the contracting agency shall receive approval from FHWA, or the recipient as appropriate, before utilizing a consultant to act in a management support role for the contracting agency; unless an alternate approval procedure has been approved. Use of consultants in management support roles does not relieve the contracting agency of responsibilities associated with the use of FAHP funds, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 302(a) and 23 U.S.C. 106(g)(4) and should be limited to large projects or circumstances where unusual cost or time constraints exist, unique technical or managerial expertise is required, and/or an increase in contracting agency staff is not a viable option.</P>

            <P>(ii) Management support roles may include, but are not limited to, providing oversight of an element of a <PRTPAGE P="28"/>highway program, function, or service on behalf of the contracting agency or may involve managing or providing oversight of a project, series of projects, or the work of other consultants and contractors on behalf of the contracting agency. Contracting agency written policies and procedures as specified in § 172.5(c) may further define allowable management roles and services a consultant may provide, specific approval responsibilities, and associated controls necessary to ensure compliance with Federal requirements.</P>
            <P>(iii) Use of consultants or subconsultants in management support roles requires appropriate conflicts of interest standards as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and adequate contracting agency staffing to administer and monitor the management consultant contract, as specified in § 172.9(d). A consultant serving in a management support role may be precluded from providing additional services on projects, activities, or contracts under its oversight due to potential conflicts of interest.</P>
            <P>(iv) FAHP funds shall not participate in the costs of a consultant serving in a management support role where the consultant was not procured in accordance with Federal and State requirements, as specified in 23 CFR 1.9(a).</P>
            <P>(v) Where benefiting more than a single Federal-aid project, allocability of consultant contract costs for services related to a management support role shall be distributed consistent with the cost principles applicable to the contracting agency, as specified in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E—Cost Principles.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Contracts and administration.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contract types.</E> The contracting agency shall use the following types of contracts:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Project-specific.</E> A contract between the contracting agency and consultant for the performance of services and defined scope of work related to a specific project or projects.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Multiphase.</E> A project-specific contract where the solicited services are divided into phases whereby the specific scope of work and associated costs may be negotiated and authorized by phase as the project progresses.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">On-call or indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ).</E> A contract for the performance of services for a number of projects, under task or work orders issued on an as-needed or on-call basis, for an established contract period. The procurement of services to be performed under on-call or IDIQ contracts shall follow either competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement procedures, as specified in § 172.7. The solicitation and contract provisions shall address the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(i) Specify a reasonable maximum length of contract period, including the number and period of any allowable contract extensions, which shall not exceed 5 years;</P>
            <P>(ii) Specify a maximum total contract dollar amount that may be awarded under a contract;</P>
            <P>(iii) Include a statement of work, requirements, specifications, or other description to define the general scope, complexity, and professional nature of the services; and</P>
            <P>(iv) If multiple consultants are to be selected and multiple on-call or IDIQ contracts awarded through a single solicitation for specific services:</P>
            <P>(A) Identify the number of consultants that may be selected or contracts that may be awarded from the solicitation; and</P>
            <P>(B) Specify the procedures the contracting agency will use in competing and awarding task or work orders among the selected, qualified consultants. Task or work orders shall not be competed and awarded among the selected, qualified consultants on the basis of costs under on-call or IDIQ contracts for services procured with competitive negotiation procedures. Under competitive negotiation procurement, each specific task or work order shall be awarded to the selected, qualified consultants:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Through an additional qualifications-based selection procedure, which may include, but does not require, a formal RFP in accordance with § 172.5(a)(1)(ii); or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) On a regional basis whereby the State is divided into regions and consultants are selected to provide on-call <PRTPAGE P="29"/>or IDIQ services for an assigned region(s) identified within the solicitation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment methods.</E> (1) The method of payment to the consultant shall be set forth in the original solicitation, contract, and in any contract modification thereto. The methods of payment shall be: Lump sum, cost plus fixed fee, cost per unit of work, or specific rates of compensation. A single contract may contain different payment methods as appropriate for compensation of different elements of work.</P>
            <P>(2) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of payment shall not be used.</P>
            <P>(3) The lump sum payment method shall only be used when the contracting agency has established the extent, scope, complexity, character, and duration of the work to be required to a degree that fair and reasonable compensation, including a fixed fee, can be determined at the time of negotiation.</P>
            <P>(4) When the method of payment is other than lump sum, the contract shall specify a maximum amount payable which shall not be exceeded unless adjusted by a contract modification.</P>
            <P>(5) The specific rates of compensation payment method provides for reimbursement on the basis of direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates, including direct labor costs, indirect costs, and fee or profit, plus any other direct expenses or costs, subject to an agreement maximum amount. This payment method shall only be used when it is not possible at the time of procurement to estimate the extent or duration of the work or to estimate costs with any reasonable degree of accuracy. This specific rates of compensation payment method should be limited to contracts or components of contracts for specialized or support type services where the consultant is not in direct control of the number of hours worked, such as construction engineering and inspection. When using this payment method, the contracting agency shall manage and monitor the consultant's level of effort and classification of employees used to perform the contracted services.</P>
            <P>(6) A contracting agency may withhold retainage from payments in accordance with prompt pay requirements, as specified in 49 CFR 26.29. When retainage is used, the terms and conditions of the contract shall clearly define agency requirements, including periodic reduction in retention and the conditions for release of retention.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Contract provisions.</E> (1) All contracts and subcontracts shall include the following provisions, either by reference or by physical incorporation into the language of each contract or subcontract, as applicable:</P>
            <P>(i) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where consultants violate or breach contract terms and conditions, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate;</P>
            <P>(ii) Notice of contracting agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting;</P>
            <P>(iii) Contracting agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data;</P>
            <P>(iv) Access by recipient, the subrecipient, FHWA, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the consultant which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions;</P>
            <P>(v) Retention of all required records for not less than 3 years after the contracting agency makes final payment and all other pending matters are closed;</P>

            <P>(xii) A provision for termination for cause and termination for convenience <PRTPAGE P="30"/>by the contracting agency including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement.</P>
            <P>(2) All contracts and subcontracts exceeding $100,000 shall contain, either by reference or by physical incorporation into the language of each contract, a provision for lobbying certification and disclosure, as specified in 49 CFR part 20.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Contract administration and monitoring</E>—(1) <E T="03">Responsible charge.</E> A full-time, public employee of the contracting agency qualified to ensure that the work delivered under contract is complete, accurate, and consistent with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract shall be in responsible charge of each contract or project. While an independent consultant may be procured to serve in a program or project management support role, as specified in § 172.7(b)(5), or to provide technical assistance in review and acceptance of engineering and design related services performed and products developed by other consultants, the contracting agency shall designate a public employee as being in responsible charge. A public employee may serve in responsible charge of multiple projects and contracting agencies may use multiple public employees to fulfill monitoring responsibilities. The term responsible charge is intended to be applied only in the context defined within this regulation. It may or may not correspond to its usage in State laws regulating the licensure and/or conduct of professional engineers. The public employee's responsibilities shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) Administering inherently governmental activities including, but not limited to, contract negotiation, contract payment, and evaluation of compliance, performance, and quality of services provided by consultant;</P>
            <P>(ii) Being familiar with the contract requirements, scope of services to be performed, and products to be produced by the consultant;</P>
            <P>(iii) Being familiar with the qualifications and responsibilities of the consultant's staff and evaluating any requested changes in key personnel;</P>
            <P>(iv) Scheduling and attending progress and project review meetings, commensurate with the magnitude, complexity, and type of work, to ensure the work is progressing in accordance with established scope of work and schedule milestones;</P>
            <P>(v) Ensuring consultant costs billed are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles and consistent with the contract terms as well as the acceptability and progress of the consultant's work;</P>
            <P>(vi) Evaluating and participating in decisions for contract modifications; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Documenting contract monitoring activities and maintaining supporting contract records, as specified in 2 CFR 200.333.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Performance evaluation.</E> The contracting agency shall prepare an evaluation summarizing the consultant's performance on a contract. The performance evaluation should include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the timely completion of work, adherence to contract scope and budget, and quality of the work conducted. The contracting agency shall provide the consultant a copy of the performance evaluation and an opportunity to provide written comments to be attached to the evaluation. The contracting agency should prepare additional interim performance evaluations based on the scope, complexity, and size of the contract as a means to provide feedback, foster communication, and achieve desired changes or improvements. Completed performance evaluations should be archived for consideration as an element of past performance in the future evaluation of the consultant to provide similar services.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Contract modification.</E> (1) Contract modifications are required for any amendments to the terms of the existing contract that change the cost of the contract; significantly change the character, scope, complexity, or duration of the work; or significantly change the conditions under which the work is required to be performed.</P>

            <P>(2) A contract modification shall clearly define and document the changes made to the contract, establish the method of payment for any adjustments in contract costs, and be in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract and original procurement.<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) A contracting agency shall negotiate contract modifications following the same procedures as the negotiation of the original contract.</P>
            <P>(4) A contracting agency may add to a contract only the type of services and work included within the scope of services of the original solicitation from which a qualifications-based selection was made.</P>
            <P>(5) For any additional engineering and design related services outside of the scope of work established in the original request for proposal, a contracting agency shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Procure the services under a new solicitation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Perform the work itself using contracting agency staff; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Use a different, existing contract under which the services would be within the scope of work.</P>
            <P>(6) Overruns in the costs of the work shall not automatically warrant an increase in the fixed fee portion of a cost plus fixed fee reimbursed contract. Permitted changes to the scope of work or duration may warrant consideration for adjustment of the fixed fee portion of cost plus fixed fee or lump sum reimbursed contracts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allowable costs and oversight.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Allowable costs.</E> (1) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts shall be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(2) Consultants shall be responsible for accounting for costs appropriately and for maintaining records, including supporting documentation, adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Elements of contract costs.</E> The following requirements shall apply to the establishment of the specified elements of contract costs:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Indirect cost rates.</E> (i) Indirect cost rates shall be updated on an annual basis in accordance with the consultant's annual accounting period and in compliance with the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(ii) Contracting agencies shall accept a consultant's or subconsultant's indirect cost rate(s) established for a 1-year applicable accounting period by a cognizant agency that has:</P>
            <P>(A) Performed an audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards to test compliance with the requirements of the Federal cost principles and issued an audit report of the consultant's indirect cost rate(s); or</P>
            <P>(B) Conducted a review of an audit report and related workpapers prepared by a certified public accountant and issued a letter of concurrence with the related audited indirect cost rate(s).</P>
            <P>(iii) When the indirect cost rate has not been established by a cognizant agency in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a STA or other recipient shall perform an evaluation of a consultant's or subconsultant's indirect cost rate prior to acceptance and application of the rate to contracts administered by the recipient or its subrecipients. The evaluation performed by STAs or other recipients to establish or accept an indirect cost rate shall provide assurance of compliance with the Federal cost principles and may consist of one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and issuing an audit report;</P>
            <P>(B) Reviewing and accepting an audit report and related workpapers prepared by a certified public accountant or another STA;</P>
            <P>(C) Establishing a provisional indirect cost rate for the specific contract and adjusting contract costs based upon an audited final rate at the completion of the contract; or</P>
            <P>(D) Conducting other evaluations in accordance with a risk-based oversight process as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and within the agency's approved written policies and procedures, as specified in § 172.5(c).</P>

            <P>(iv) A lower indirect cost rate may be accepted for use on a contract if submitted voluntarily by a consultant; however, the consultant's offer of a lower indirect cost rate shall not be a condition or qualification to be considered for the work or contract award.<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) Once accepted in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section, contracting agencies shall apply such indirect cost rate for the purposes of contract estimation, negotiation, administration, reporting, and contract payment and the indirect cost rate shall not be limited by administrative or de facto ceilings of any kind.</P>
            <P>(vi) A consultant's accepted indirect cost rate for its 1-year applicable accounting period shall be applied to contracts; however, once an indirect cost rate is established for a contract, it may be extended beyond the 1-year applicable period, through the duration of the specific contract, provided all concerned parties agree. Agreement to the extension of the 1-year applicable period shall not be a condition or qualification to be considered for the work or contract award.</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Disputed rates.</E> If an indirect cost rate established by a cognizant agency in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is in dispute, the contracting agency does not have to accept the rate. A contracting agency may perform its own audit or other evaluation of the consultant's indirect cost rate for application to the specific contract, until or unless the dispute is resolved. A contracting agency may alternatively negotiate a provisional indirect cost rate for the specific contract and adjust contract costs based upon an audited final rate. Only the consultant and the parties involved in performing the indirect cost audit may dispute the established indirect cost rate. If an error is discovered in the established indirect cost rate, the rate may be disputed by any prospective contracting agency.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct salary or wage rates.</E> (i) Compensation for each employee or classification of employee must be reasonable for the work performed in accordance with the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(ii) To provide for fair and reasonable compensation, considering the classification, experience, and responsibility of employees necessary to provide the desired engineering and design related services, contracting agencies may establish consultant direct salary or wage rate limitations or “benchmarks” based upon an objective assessment of the reasonableness of proposed rates performed in accordance with the reasonableness provisions of the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(iii) When an assessment of reasonableness in accordance with the Federal cost principles has not been performed, contracting agencies shall use and apply the consultant's actual direct salary or wage rates for estimation, negotiation, administration, and payment of contracts and contract modifications.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Fixed fee.</E> (i) The determination of the amount of fixed fee shall consider the scope, complexity, contract duration, degree of risk borne by the consultant, amount of subcontracting, and professional nature of the services as well as the size and type of contract.</P>
            <P>(ii) The establishment of fixed fee shall be contract or task order specific.</P>
            <P>(iii) Fixed fees in excess of 15 percent of the total direct labor and indirect costs of the contract may be justified only when exceptional circumstances exist.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Other direct costs.</E> A contracting agency shall use the Federal cost principles in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of other direct contract costs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Oversight</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agency controls.</E> Contracting agencies shall provide reasonable assurance that consultant costs on contracts reimbursed in whole or in part with FAHP funding are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles and consistent with the contract terms considering the contract type and payment method. Contracting agency written policies, procedures, contract documents, and other controls, as specified in §§ 172.5(c) and 172.9 shall address the establishment, acceptance, and administration of contract costs to assure compliance with the Federal cost principles and requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk-based analysis.</E> The STAs or other recipient may employ a risk-based oversight process to provide reasonable assurance of consultant compliance with Federal cost principles on FAHP funded contracts administered by the recipient or its subrecipients. If employed, this risk-based oversight process shall be incorporated into STA or other recipient written policies and procedures, as specified in § 172.5(c). In <PRTPAGE P="33"/>addition to ensuring allowability of direct contract costs, the risk-based oversight process shall address the evaluation and acceptance of consultant and subconsultant indirect cost rates for application to contracts. A risk-based oversight process shall consist of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Risk assessments.</E> Conducting and documenting an annual assessment of risks of noncompliance with the Federal cost principles per consultant doing business with the agency, considering the following factors:</P>

            <P>(J) Changes in consultant organizational structure; and</P>
            <P>(K) Other factors as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Risk mitigation and evaluation procedures.</E> Allocating resources, as considered necessary based on the results of the annual risk assessment, to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the Federal cost principles through application of the following types of risk mitigation and evaluation procedures appropriate to the consultant and circumstances:</P>
            <P>(A) Audits performed in accordance with generally accepted government audit standards to test compliance with the requirements of the Federal cost principles;</P>
            <P>(B) Certified public accountant or other STA workpaper reviews;</P>
            <P>(C) Other analytical procedures;</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Consultant cost certification.</E> (i) Indirect cost rate proposals for the consultant's 1-year applicable accounting period shall not be accepted and no agreement shall be made by a contracting agency to establish final indirect cost rates, unless the costs have been certified by an official of the consultant as being allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles. The certification requirement shall apply to all indirect cost rate proposals submitted by consultants and subconsultants for acceptance by a STA or other recipient. Each consultant or subconsultant is responsible for certification of its own indirect cost rate and may not certify the rate of another firm.</P>
            <P>(ii) The certifying official shall be an individual executive or financial officer of the consultant's organization at a level no lower than a Vice President or Chief Financial Officer, or equivalent, who has the authority to represent the financial information utilized to establish the indirect cost rate proposal submitted for acceptance.</P>

            <P>(a) State assurances in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</P>

            <P>(1) Title 49, CFR part 21 (Department of Transportation Regulations for the implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) requires assurances from States that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied <PRTPAGE P="41"/>the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity for which the recipient receives Federal assistance from the Department of Transportation, including the Federal Highway Administration.</P>
            <P>(2) Section 162a of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 (section 324, title 23 U.S.C.) requires that there be no discrimination on the ground of sex. The FHWA considers all assurances heretofore received to have been amended to include a prohibition against discrimination on the ground of sex. These assurances were signed by the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. The State highway agency shall submit a certification to the FHWA indicating that the requirements of section 162a of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 have been added to its assurances.</P>
            <P>(3) The State highway agency shall take affirmative action to correct any deficiencies found by the FHWA within a reasonable time period, not to exceed 90 days, in order to implement Title VI compliance in accordance with State-signed assurances and required guidelines. The head of the State highway agency shall be held responsible for implementing Title VI requirements.</P>
            <P>(4) The State program area officials and Title VI Specialist shall conduct annual reviews of all pertinent program areas to determine the effectiveness of program area activities at all levels.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">State actions.</E> (1) Establish a civil rights unit and designate a coordinator who has a responsible position in the organization and easy access to the head of the State highway agency. This unit shall contain a Title VI Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator or a Title VI Specialist, who shall be responsible for initiating and monitoring Title VI activities and preparing required reports.</P>
            <P>(2) Adequately staff the civil rights unit to effectively implement the State civil rights requirements.</P>
            <P>(3) Develop procedures for prompt processing and disposition of Title VI and Title VIII complaints received directly by the State and not by FHWA. Complaints shall be investigated by State civil rights personnel trained in compliance investigations. Identify each complainant by race, color, sex, or national origin; the recipient; the nature of the complaint; the dates the complaint was filed and the investigation completed; the disposition; the date of the disposition; and other pertinent information.

              <P>(a) The State highway agency shall determine which Federal-aid highway construction contracts shall include the “Training Special Provisions” (appendix B) and the minimum number of trainees to be specified therein after giving appropriate consideration to the guidelines set forth in § 230.111(c). The “Training Special Provisions” shall supersede section 7(b) of the Special Provisions (appendix A) entitled “Specific Equal Employment Opportunity Responsibilities.” Minor wording revisions will be required to the “Training Special Provisions” in areas having “Hometown” or “Imposed Plan” requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) The Washington Headquarters shall establish and publish annually suggested minimum training goals. These goals will be based on the Federal-aid apportioned amounts and the minority population. A State will have achieved its goal if the total number of training slots on selected federally aided highway construction contracts which have been awarded during each 12-month period equals or exceeds the State's suggested minimum annual goal. In the event a State highway agency does not attain its goal during a calendar year, the State highway agency at the end of the calendar year shall inform the Administrator of the reasons for its inability to meet the suggested minimum number of training slots and the steps to be taken to achieve the goal during the next calendar year. The information is to be submitted not later than 30 days from the end of the calendar year and should be factual, and should not only indicate the situations occurring during the year but show the project conditions at least through the coming year. The final determination will be made on what training goals are considered to be realistic based on the information submitted by a State.</P>
              <P>(c) The following guidelines shall be utilized by the State highway agency in selecting projects and determining the number of trainees to be provided training therein:</P>
              <P>(1) Availability of minorities, women, and disadvantaged for training.</P>
              <P>(2) The potential for effective training.</P>
              <P>(3) Duration of the contract.</P>
              <P>(4) Dollar value of the contract.</P>
              <P>(5) Total normal work force that the average bidder could be expected to use.</P>
              <P>(6) Geographic location.</P>
              <P>(7) Type of work.</P>
              <P>(8) The need for additional journeymen in the area.</P>
              <P>(9) Recognition of the suggested minimum goal for the State.</P>
              <P>(10) A satisfactory ratio of trainees to journeymen expected to be on the contractor's work force during normal operations (considered to fall between 1:10 and 1:4).</P>
              <P>(d) Training programs which are established shall be approved only if they meet the standards set forth in appendix B with regard to:</P>
              <P>(1) The primary objectives of training and upgrading minority group workers, women and disadvantaged persons.</P>
              <P>(2) The development of full journeymen.</P>
              <P>(3) The minimum length and type of training.</P>
              <P>(4) The minimum wages of trainees.</P>
              <P>(5) Trainees certifications.</P>
              <P>(6) Keeping records and furnishing reports.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Training programs considered by a State highway agency to meet the standards under this directive shall be submitted to the FHWA division Administrator with a recommendation for approval.</P>
              <P>(2) Employment pursuant to training programs approved by the FHWA division Administrator will be exempt from the minimum wage rate provisions of section 113 of title 23 U.S.C. Approval, however, shall not be given to training programs which provide for employment of trainees at wages less than those required by the Special Training Provisions. (Appendix B.)</P>

              <P>(f)(1) Apprenticeship programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor as of the date of proposed use by a Federal-aid highway contractor or subcontractor need not be formally approved by the State highway agency or the FHWA division Administrator. Such programs, including their minimum wage provisions, are acceptable for use, provided they are administered <PRTPAGE P="46"/>in a manner reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor.</P>
              <P>(2) Other training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor as of the date of proposed use by a Federal-aid highway contractor or subcontractor are also acceptable for use without the formal approval of the State highway agency or the division Administrator provided:</P>
              <P>(i) The U.S. Department of Labor has clearly approved the program aspects relating to equal employment opportunity and the payment of trainee wage rates in lieu of prevailing wage rates.</P>
              <P>(ii) They are reasonably calculated to qualify the average trainees for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the training period.</P>
              <P>(iii) They are administered in a manner calculated to meet the equal employment obligations of the contractors.</P>
              <P>(g) The State highway agencies have the option of permitting Federal-aid highway construction contractors to bid on training to be given under this directive. The following procedures are to be utilized by those State highway agencies that elect to provide a bid item for training:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of training positions shall continue to be specified in the Special Training Provisions. Furthermore, this number should be converted into an estimated number of hours of training which is to be used in arriving at the total bid price for the training item. Increases and decreases from the estimated amounts would be handled as overruns or underruns;</P>
              <P>(2) A section concerning the method of payment should be included in the Special Training Provisions. Some offsite training is permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a substantial part of the overall training. Furthermore, the trainee must be concurrently employed on a federally aided highway construction project subject to the Special Training Provisions attached to this directive. Reimbursement for offsite training may only be made to the contractor where he does one or more of the following: Contributes to the cost of the training, provides the instruction to the trainee, or pays the trainee's wages during the offsite training period;</P>
              <P>(3) A State highway agency may modify the special provisions to specify the numbers to be trained in specific job classifications;</P>
              <P>(4) A State highway agency can specify training standards provided any prospective bidder can use them, the training standards are made known in the advertised specifications, and such standards are found acceptable by FHWA.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">specific equal employment opportunity responsibilities</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> a. Equal employment opportunity requirements not to discriminate and to take affirmative action to assure equal employment opportunity as required by Executive Order 11246 and Executive Order 11375 are set forth in Required Contract, Provisions (Form PR-1273 or 1316, as appropriate) and these Special Provisions which are imposed pursuant to section 140 of title 23 U.S.C., as established by section 22 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. The requirements set forth in these Special Provisions shall constitute the specific affirmative action requirements for project activities under this contract and supplement the equal employment opportunity requirements set forth in the Required Contract Provisions.</P>
              <P>b. The contractor will work with the State highway agencies and the Federal Government in carrying out equal employment opportunity obligations and in their review of his/her activities under the contract.</P>
              <P>c. The contractor and all his/her subcontractors holding subcontracts not including material suppliers, of $10,000 or more, will comply with the following minimum specific requirement activities of equal employment opportunity: (The equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as set forth in volume 6, chapter 4, section 1, subsection 1 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, are applicable to material suppliers as well as contractors and subcontractors.) The contractor will include these requirements in every subcontract of $10,000 or more with such modification of language as is necessary to make them binding on the subcontractor.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.</E> The contractor will accept as his operating policy the following statement which is designed to further the provision of equal employment opportunity to all persons without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive continuing program:</P>
              <P>It is the policy of this Company to assure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, religion, sex, color, or national origin. Such action shall include: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship, preapprenticeship, and/or on-the-job training.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Equal Employment Opportunity Officer.</E> The contractor will designate and make known to the State highway agency contracting officers and equal employment opportunity officer (hereinafter referred to as the EEO Officer) who will have the responsibility for and must be capable of effectively administering and promoting an active contractor program of equal employment opportunity and who must be assigned adequate authority and responsibility to do so.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Dissemination of Policy.</E> a. All members of the contractor's staff who are authorized to hire, supervise, promote, and discharge employees, or who recommend such action, or who are substantially involved in such action, will be made fully cognizant of, and will implement, the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and contractual responsibilities to provide equal employment opportunity in each grade and classification of employment. To ensure that the above agreement will be met, the following actions will be taken as a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) Periodic meetings of supervisory and personnel office employees will be conducted before the start of work and then not less often than once every six months, at which time the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and its implementation will be reviewed and explained. The meetings will be conducted by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable company official.</P>
              <P>(2) All new supervisory or personnel office employees will be given a thorough indoctrination by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable company official, covering all major aspects of the contractor's equal employment opportunity obligations within thirty days following their reporting for duty with the contractor.</P>
              <P>(3) All personnel who are engaged in direct recruitment for the project will be instructed by the EEO Officer or appropriate company official in the contractor's procedures for locating and hiring minority group employees.</P>

              <P>b. In order to make the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy known to all employees, prospective employees and potential sources of employees, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, schools, employment agencies, labor unions (where appropriate), college placement officers, etc., the contractor will take the following actions:</P>

              <P>(1) Notices and posters setting forth the contractor's equal employment opportunity <PRTPAGE P="50"/>policy will be placed in areas readily accessible to employees, applicants for employment and potential employees.</P>
              <P>(2) The contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and the procedures to implement such policy will be brought to the attention of employees by means of meetings, employee handbooks, or other appropriate means.</P>
              <P>5. Recruitment. a. When advertising for employees, the contractor will include in all advertisements for employees the notation: “An Equal Opportunity Employer.” All such advertisements will be published in newspapers or other publications having a large circulation among minority groups in the area from which the project work force would normally be derived.</P>
              <P>b. The contractor will, unless precluded by a valid bargaining agreement, conduct systematic and direct recruitment through public and private employee referral sources likely to yield qualified minority group applicants, including, but not limited to, State employment agencies, schools, colleges and minority group organizations. To meet this requirement, the contractor will, through his EEO Officer, identify sources of potential minority group employees, and establish with such identified sources procedures whereby minority group applicants may be referred to the contractor for employment consideration.</P>
              <P>In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement providing for exclusive hiring hall referrals, he is expected to observe the provisions of that agreement to the extent that the system permits the contractor's compliance with equal employment opportunity contract provisions. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that where implementation of such agreements have the effect of discriminating against minorities or women, or obligates the contractor to do the same, such implementation violates Executive Order 11246, as amended.)</P>
              <P>c. The contractor will encourage his present employees to refer minority group applicants for employment by posting appropriate notices or bulletins in areas accessible to all such employees. In addition, information and procedures with regard to referring minority group applicants will be discussed with employees.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Personnel Actions.</E> Wages, working conditions, and employee benefits shall be established and administered, and personnel actions of every type, including hiring, upgrading, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, and termination, shall be taken without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The following procedures shall be followed:</P>
              <P>a. The contractor will conduct periodic inspections of project sites to insure that working conditions and employee facilities do not indicate discriminatory treatment of project site personnel.</P>
              <P>b. The contractor will periodically evaluate the spread of wages paid within each classification to determine any evidence of discriminatory wage practices.</P>
              <P>c. The contractor will periodically review selected personnel actions in depth to determine whether there is evidence of discrimination. Where evidence is found, the contractor will promptly take corrective action. If the review indicates that the discrimination may extend beyond the actions reviewed, such corrective action shall include all affected persons.</P>
              <P>d. The contractor will promptly investigate all complaints of alleged discrimination made to the contractor in connection with his obligations under this contract, will attempt to resolve such complaints, and will take appropriate corrective action within a reasonable time. If the investigation indicates that the discrimination may affect persons other than the complainant, such corrective action shall include such other persons. Upon completion of each investigation, the contractor will inform every complainant of all of his avenues of appeal.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Training and Promotion.</E> a. The contractor will assist in locating, qualifying, and increasing the skills of minority group and women employees, and applicants for employment.</P>

              <P>b. Consistent with the contractor's work force requirements and as permissible under Federal and State regulations, the contractor shall make full use of training programs, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs for the geographical area of contract performance. Where feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training. In the event the Training Special Provision is provided under this contract, this subparagraph will be superseded as indicated in Attachment 2.</P>
              <P>c. The contractor will advise employees and applicants for employment of available training programs and entrance requirements for each.</P>
              <P>d. The contractor will periodically review the training and promotion potential of minority group and women employees and will encourage eligible employees to apply for such training and promotion.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Unions.</E> If the contractor relies in whole or in part upon unions as a source of employees, the contractor will use his/her best efforts to obtain the cooperation of such unions to increase opportunities for minority groups and women within the unions, and to effect referrals by such unions of minority and female employees. Actions by the contractor either directly or through a contractor's association acting as agent will include the procedures set forth below:<PRTPAGE P="51"/>
              </P>
              <P>a. The contractor will use best efforts to develop, in cooperation with the unions, joint training programs aimed toward qualifying more minority group members and women for membership in the unions and increasing the skills of minority group employees and women so that they may qualify for higher paying employment.</P>
              <P>b. The contractor will use best efforts to incorporate an equal employment opportunity clause into each union agreement to the end that such union will be contractually bound to refer applicants without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</P>
              <P>c. The contractor is to obtain information as to the referral practices and policies of the labor union except that to the extent such information is within the exclusive possession of the labor union and such labor union refuses to furnish such information to the contractor, the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department and shall set forth what efforts have been made to obtain such information.</P>
              <P>d. In the event the union is unable to provide the contractor with a reasonable flow of minority and women referrals within the time limit set forth in the collective bargaining agreement, the contractor will, through independent recruitment efforts, fill the employment vacancies without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; making full efforts to obtain qualified and/or qualifiable minority group persons and women. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that it shall be no excuse that the union with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral failed to refer minority employees.) In the event the union referral practice prevents the contractor from meeting the obligations pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and these special provisions, such contractor shall immediately notify the State highway agency.</P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Subcontracting.</E> a. The contractor will use his best efforts to solicit bids from and to utilize minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority group and female representation among their employees. Contractors shall obtain lists of minority-owned construction firms from State highway agency personnel.</P>
              <P>b. The contractor will use his best efforts to ensure subcontractor compliance with their equal employment opportunity obligations.</P>
              <P>10. <E T="03">Records and Reports.</E> a. The contractor will keep such records as are necessary to determine compliance with the contractor's equal employment opportunity obligations. The records kept by the contractor will be designed to indicate:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of minority and nonminority group members and women employed in each work classification on the project.</P>
              <P>(2) The progress and efforts being made in cooperation with unions to increase employment opportunities for minorities and women (applicable only to contractors who rely in whole or in part on unions as a source of their work force),</P>
              <P>(3) The progress and efforts being made in locating, hiring, training, qualifying, and upgrading minority and female employees, and</P>
              <P>(4) The progress and efforts being made in securing the services of minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority and female representation among their employees.</P>
              <P>b. All such records must be retained for a period of three years following completion of the contract work and shall be available at reasonable times and places for inspection by authorized representatives of the State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration.</P>
              <P>c. The contractors will submit an annual report to the State highway agency each July for the duration of the project, indicating the number of minority, women, and non-minority group employees currently engaged in each work classification required by the contract work. This information is to be reported on Form PR 1391. If on-the-job training is being required by “Training Special Provision”, the contractor will be required to furnish Form FHWA 1409.</P>

              <P>In the event that a contractor subcontracts a portion of the contract work, he shall determine how many, if any, of the trainees are to be trained by the subcontractor, provided, however, that the contractor shall retain the primary responsibility for meeting the training requirements imposed by this special provision. The contractor shall also insure that this training <PRTPAGE P="52"/>special provision is made applicable to such subcontract. Where feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training.</P>
              <P>The number of trainees shall be distributed among the work classifications on the basis of the contractor's needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classifications within a reasonable area of recruitment. Prior to commencing construction, the contractor shall submit to the State highway agency for approval the number of trainees to be trained in each selected classification and training program to be used. Furthermore, the contractor shall specify the starting time for training in each of the classifications. The contractor will be credited for each trainee employed by him on the contract work who is currently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an approved program and will be reimbursed for such trainees as provided hereinafter.</P>
              <P>Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeymen status is a primary objective of this Training Special Provision. Accordingly, the contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority trainees and women (e.g., by conducting systematic and direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority and women trainees) to the extent that such persons are available within a reasonable area of recruitment. The contractor will be responsible for demonstrating the steps that he has taken in pursuance thereof, prior to a determination as to whether the contractor is in compliance with this Training Special Provision. This training commitment is not intended, and shall not be used, to discriminate against any applicant for training, whether a member of a minority group or not.</P>
              <P>No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classification in which he has successfully completed a training course leading to journeyman status or in which he has been employed as a journeyman. The contractor should satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions in the employee application or by other suitable means. Regardless of the method used the contractor's records should document the findings in each case.</P>
              <P>The minimum length and type of training for each classification will be as established in the training program selected by the contractor and approved by the State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration. The State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration shall approve a program if it is reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor and to qualify the average trainee for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the training period. Furthermore, apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State apprenticeship agency recognized by the Bureau and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall also be considered acceptable provided it is being administered in a manner consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federal-aid highway construction contracts. Approval or acceptance of a training program shall be obtained from the State prior to commencing work on the classification covered by the program. It is the intention of these provisions that training is to be provided in the construction crafts rather than clerk-typists or secretarial-type positions. Training is permissible in lower level management positions such as office engineers, estimators, timekeepers, etc., where the training is oriented toward construction applications. Training in the laborer classification may be permitted provided that significant and meaningful training is provided and approved by the division office. Some offsite training is permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a significant part of the overall training.</P>
              <P>Except as otherwise noted below, the contractor will be reimbursed 80 cents per hour of training given an employee on this contract in accordance with an approved training program. As approved by the engineer, reimbursement will be made for training persons in excess of the number specified herein. This reimbursement will be made even though the contractor receives additional training program funds from other sources, provided such other does not specifically prohibit the contractor from receiving other reimbursement. Reimbursement for offsite training indicated above may only be made to the contractor where he does one or more of the following and the trainees are concurrently employed on a Federal-aid project; contributes to the cost of the training, provides the instruction to the trainee or pays the trainee's wages during the offsite training period.</P>

              <P>No payment shall be made to the contractor if either the failure to provide the required training, or the failure to hire the trainee as a journeyman, is caused by the contractor and evidences a lack of good faith on the part of the contractor in meeting the requirements of this Training Special Provision. It is normally expected that a trainee will begin his training on the project as soon as feasible after start of work utilizing the skill involved and remain on the project as long as training opportunities exist in his work classification or until he has completed his training program. It is not required that all trainees be on board for the entire length <PRTPAGE P="53"/>of the contract. A contractor will have fulfilled his responsibilities under this Training Special Provision if he has provided acceptable training to the number of trainees specified. The number trained shall be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled on the contract for a significant period.</P>
              <P>Trainees will be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate minimum journeyman's rate specified in the contract for the first half of the training period, 75 percent for the third quarter of the training period, and 90 percent for the last quarter of the training period, unless apprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on this project. In that case, the appropriate rates approved by the Departments of Labor or Transportation in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classification who are covered by this Training Special Provision.</P>
              <P>The contractor shall furnish the trainee a copy of the program he will follow in providing the training. The contractor shall provide each trainee with a certification showing the type and length of training satisfactorily completed.</P>
              <P>The contractor will provide for the maintenance of records and furnish periodic reports documenting his performance under this Training Special Provision.</P>

              <P>This form is to be developed from the “Contractor's Annual EEO Report.” This data is to be compiled by the State and submitted annually. It should reflect the total employment on all Federal-Aid Highway Projects in the State as of July 31st. The <PRTPAGE P="56"/>staffing figures to be reported should represent the project work force on board in all or any part of the last payroll period preceding the end of July. The staffing figures to be reported in Table A should include journey-level men and women, apprentices, and on-the-job trainees. Staffing figures to be reported in Table B should include only apprentices and on-the-job trainees as indicated.</P>
              <P>Entries made for “Job Categories” are to be confined to the listing shown. Miscellaneous job classifications are to be incorporated in the most appropriate category listed on the form. All employees on projects should thus be accounted for.</P>
              <P>This information will be useful in complying with the U.S. Senate Committee on Public Works request that the Federal Highway Administration submit a report annually on the status of the Equal Employment Opportunity Program, its effectiveness, and progress made by the States and the Administration in carrying out section 22(A) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. In addition, the form should be used as a valuable tool for States to evaluate their own programs for ensuring equal opportunity.</P>
              <P>It is requested that States submit this information annually to the FHWA Divisions no later than September 25.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the availability of funds under 23 U.S.C. 140(c), the State highway agency shall establish procedures to develop, conduct, and administer minority business enterprise training and assistance programs specifically for the benefit of women and minority businesses. Supportive services funds allocated to the States shall not be used to finance the training of State highway agency employees or to provide services in support of such training. State highway agencies are not required to match funds allocated to them under this section. Individual States are encouraged to be actively involved in the provision of supportive services.

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">part ii—state highway agency employment</HD>
              <P>I. <E T="03">General.</E> The State highway agency's (SHA) internal program is an integral part of the agency's total activities. It should include the involvement, commitment and support of executives, managers, supervisors and all other employees. For effective administration and implementation of the EEO Program, an affirmative action plan (AAP) is required. The scope of an EEO program and an AAP must be comprehensive, covering all elements of the agency's personnel management policies and practices. The major part of an AAP must be recognition and removal of any barriers to equal employment opportunity, identification of problem areas and of persons unfairly excluded or held back and action enabling them to compete for jobs on an equal basis. An effective AAP not only benefits those who have been denied equal employment opportunity but will also greatly benefit the organization which often has overlooked, screened out or underutilized the great reservoir of untapped human resources and skills, especially among women and minority groups.</P>
              <P>Set forth are general guidelines designed to assist the State highway agencies in implementing internal programs, including the development and implementation of AAP's to ensure fair and equal treatment for all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in all employment practices.</P>
              <P>II. <E T="03">Administration and implementation.</E> The head of each State highway agency is responsible for the overall administration of the internal EEO program, including the total integration of equal opportunity into all facets of personnel management. However, specific program responsibilities should be assigned for carrying out the program at all management levels.</P>
              <P>To ensure effectiveness in the implementation of the internal EEO program, a specific and realistic AAP should be developed. It should include both short and long-range objectives, with priorities and target dates for achieving goals and measuring progress, according to the agency's individual need to overcome existing problems.</P>
              <P>A. <E T="03">State Highway Agency Affirmative Action Officer (internal).</E> 1. <E T="03">Appointment of Affirmative Action Officer.</E> The head of the SHA should appoint a qualified Affirmative Action (AA) Officer (Internal EEO Officer) with responsibility and authority to implement the internal EEO program. In making the selection, the following factors should be considered:<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
              </P>
              <P>a. The person appointed should have proven ability to accomplish major program goals.</P>
              <P>b. Managing the internal EEO program requires a major time commitment; it cannot be added on to an existing full-time job.</P>
              <P>c. Appointing qualified minority and/or female employees to head or staff the program may offer good role models for present and potential employees and add credibility to the programs involved. However, the most essential requirements for such position(s) are sensitivity to varied ways in which discrimination limits job opportunities, commitment to program goals and sufficient status and ability to work with others in the agency to achieve them.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Responsibilities of the Affirmative Action Officer.</E> The responsibilities of the AA Officer should include, but not necessarily be limited to:</P>
              <P>a. Developing the written AAP.</P>
              <P>b. Publicizing its content internally and externally.</P>
              <P>c. Assisting managers and supervisors in collecting and analyzing employment data, identifying problem areas, setting goals and timetables and developing programs to achieve goals. Programs should include specific remedies to eliminate any discriminatory practices discovered in the employment system.</P>
              <P>d. Handling and processing formal discrimination complaints.</P>
              <P>e. Designing, implementing and monitoring internal audit and reporting systems to measure program effectiveness and to determine where progress has been made and where further action is needed.</P>
              <P>f. Reporting, at least quarterly, to the head of the SHA on progress and deficiencies of each unit in relation to agency goals.</P>
              <P>g. In addition, consider the creation of:</P>
              <P>(1) An EEO Advisory Committee, whose membership would include top management officials,</P>
              <P>(2) An EEO Employee Committee, whose membership would include rank and file employees, with minority and female representatives from various job levels and departments to meet regularly with the AA officer, and</P>
              <P>(3) An EEO Counseling Program to attempt informal resolution of discrimination complaints.</P>
              <P>B. <E T="03">Contents of an affirmative action plan.</E> The Affirmative Action Plan (AAP) is an integral part of the SHA's EEO program. Although the style and format of AAP's may vary from one SHA to another, the basic substance will generally be the same. The essence of the AAP should include, but not necessarily be limited to:</P>
              <P>1. Inclusion of a strong agency policy statement of commitment to EEO.</P>
              <P>2. Assignment of responsibility and authority for program to a qualified individual.</P>
              <P>3. A survey of the labor market area in terms of population makeup, skills, and availability for employment.</P>
              <P>4. Analyzing the present work force to identify jobs, departments and units where minorities and females are underutilized.</P>
              <P>5. Setting specific, measurable, attainable hiring and promotion goals, with target dates, in each area of underutilization.</P>
              <P>6. Making every manager and supervisor responsible and accountable for meeting these goals.</P>
              <P>7. Reevaluating job descriptions and hiring criteria to assure that they reflect actual job needs.</P>
              <P>8. Finding minorities and females who are qualified or qualifiable to fill jobs.</P>
              <P>9. Getting minorities and females into upward mobility and relevant training programs where they have not had previous access.</P>
              <P>10. Developing systems to monitor and measure progress regularly. If results are not satisfactory to meet goals, determine the reasons and make necessary changes.</P>
              <P>11. Developing a procedure whereby employees and applicants may process allegations of discrimination to an impartial body without fear of reprisal.</P>
              <P>C. <E T="03">Implementation of an affirmative action plan.</E> The written AAP is the framework and management tool to be used at all organizational levels to actively implement, measure and evaluate program progress on the specific action items which represent EEO program problems or deficiencies. The presence of a written plan alone does not constitute an EEO program, nor is it, in itself, evidence of an ongoing program. As a minimum, the following specific actions should be taken.</P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Issue written equal employment opportunity policy statement and affirmative action commitment.</E> To be effective, EEO policy provisions must be enforced by top management, and all employees must be made aware that EEO is basic agency policy. The head of the SHA (1) should issue a firm statement of personal commitment, legal obligation and the importance of EEO as an agency goal, and (2) assign specific responsibility and accountability to each executive, manager and supervisor.</P>
              <P>The statement should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following elements:</P>
              <P>a. EEO for all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin as a fundamental agency policy.</P>
              <P>b. Personal commitment to and support of EEO by the head of the SHA.</P>
              <P>c. The requirement that special affirmative action be taken throughout the agency to overcome the effects of past discrimination.</P>

              <P>d. The requirement that the EEO program be a goal setting program with measurement <PRTPAGE P="64"/>and evaluation factors similar to other major agency programs.</P>
              <P>e. Equal opportunity in all employment practices, including (but not limited to) recruiting, hiring, transfers, promotions, training, compensation, benefits, recognition (awards), layoffs, and other terminations.</P>
              <P>f. Responsibility for positive affirmative action in the discharge of EEO programs, including performance evaluations of managers and supervisors in such functions, will be expected of and shared by all management personnel.</P>
              <P>g. Accountability for action or inaction in the area of EEO by management personnel.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Publicize the affirmative action plan.</E> a. <E T="03">Internally:</E> (1) Distribute written communications from the head of the SHA.</P>
              <P>(2) Include the AAP and the EEO policy statement in agency operations manual.</P>
              <P>(3) Hold individual meetings with managers and supervisors to discuss the program, their individual responsibilities and to review progress.</P>
              <P>(4) Place Federal and State EEO posters on bulletin boards, near time clocks and in personnel offices.</P>
              <P>(5) Publicize the AAP in the agency newsletters and other publications.</P>
              <P>(6) Present and discuss the AAP as a part of employee orientation and all training programs.</P>
              <P>(7) Invite employee organization representatives to cooperate and assist in developing and implementing the AAP.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Externally:</E> Distribute the AAP to minority groups and women's organizations, community action groups, appropriate State agencies, professional organizations, etc.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Develop and implement specific programs to eliminate discriminatory barriers and achieve goals.</E> a. <E T="03">Job structuring and upward mobility:</E> The AAP should include specific provisions for:</P>
              <P>(1) Periodic classification plan reviews to correct inaccurate position descriptions and to ensure that positions are allocated to the appropriate classification.</P>
              <P>(2) Plans to ensure that all qualification requirements are closely job related.</P>
              <P>(3) Efforts to restructure jobs and establish entry level and trainee positions to facilitate progression within occupational areas.</P>
              <P>(4) Career counseling and guidance to employees.</P>
              <P>(5) Creating career development plans for lower grade employees who are underutilized or who demonstrate potential for advancement.</P>
              <P>(6) Widely publicizing upward mobility programs and opportunities within each work unit and within the total organizational structure.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Recruitment and placement.</E> The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Active recruitment efforts to support and supplement those of the central personnel agency or department, reaching all appropriate sources to obtain qualified employees on a nondiscriminatory basis.</P>
              <P>(2) Maintaining contracts with organizations representing minority groups, women, professional societies, and other sources of candidates for technical, professional and management level positions.</P>
              <P>(3) Ensuring that recruitment literature is relevant to all employees, including minority groups and women.</P>
              <P>(4) Reviewing and monitoring recruitment and placement procedures so as to assure that no discriminatory practices exist.</P>
              <P>(5) Cooperating with management and the central personnel agency on the review and validation of written tests and other selection devices.</P>
              <P>(6) Analyzing the flow of applicants through the selection and appointment process, including an analytical review of reasons for rejections.</P>
              <P>(7) Monitoring the placement of employees to ensure the assignment of work and workplace on a nondiscriminatory basis.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Promotions.</E> The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:</P>
              <P>1. Establishing an agency-wide merit promotion program, including a merit promotion plan, to provide equal opportunity for all persons based on merit and without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin.</P>
              <P>2. Monitoring the operation of the merit promotion program, including a review of promotion actions, to assure that requirements procedures and practices support EEO program objectives and do not have a discriminatory impact in actual operation.</P>
              <P>3. Establishing skills banks to match employee skills with available job advancement opportunities.</P>
              <P>4. Evaluating promotion criteria (supervisory evaluations, oral interviews, written tests, qualification standards, etc.) and their use by selecting officials to identify and eliminate factors which may lead to improper “selection out” of employees or applicants, particularly minorities and women, who traditionally have not had access to better jobs. It may be appropriate to require selecting officials to submit a written justification when well qualified persons are passed over for upgrading or promotion.</P>
              <P>5. Assuring that all job vacancies are posted conspicuously and that all employees are encouraged to bid on all jobs for which they feel they are qualified.</P>

              <P>6. Publicizing the agency merit promotion program by highlighting breakthrough promotions, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, advancement of minorities and women to key jobs, new career heights, etc.<PRTPAGE P="65"/>
              </P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Training.</E> The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Requiring managers and supervisors to participate in EEO seminars covering the AAP, the overall EEO program and the administration of the policies and procedures incorporated therein, and on Federal, State and local laws relating to EEO.</P>
              <P>(2) Training in proper interviewing techniques of employees who conduct employment selection interviews.</P>
              <P>(3) Training and education programs designed to provide opportunities for employees to advance in relation to the present and projected manpower needs of the agency and the employees' career goals.</P>
              <P>(4) The review of profiles of training course participants to ensure that training opportunities are being offered to all eligible employees on an equal basis and to correct any inequities discovered.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Layoffs, recalls, discharges, demotions, and disciplinary actions.</E> The standards for deciding when a person shall be terminated, demoted, disciplined, laid off or recalled should be the same for all employees, including minorities and females. Seemingly neutral practices should be reexamined to see if they have a disparate effect on such groups. For example, if more minorities and females are being laid off because they were the last hired, then, adjustments should be made to assure that the minority and female ratios do not decrease because of these actions.</P>
              <P>(1) When employees, particularly minorities and females, are disciplined, laid off, discharged or downgraded, it is advisable that the actions be reviewed by the AA Officer before they become final.</P>
              <P>(2) Any punitive action (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, harassment, terminations, demotions), taken as a result of employees filing discrimination complaints, is illegal.</P>
              <P>(3) The following records should be kept to monitor this area of the internal EEO program:</P>
              <P>On all terminations, including layoffs and discharges: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone number), employment date, termination date, recall rights, sex, racial/ethnic identification (by job category), type of termination and reason for termination.</P>
              <P>On all demotions: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone number), demotion date, sex, racial/ethnic identification (by job category), and reason for demotion.</P>
              <P>On all recalls: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone number) recall date, sex, and racial/ethnic identification (by job category).</P>
              <P>Exit interviews should be conducted with employees who leave the employment of the SHA.</P>
              <P>f. <E T="03">Other personnel actions.</E> The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Assuring that information on EEO counseling and grievance procedures is easily available to all employees.</P>
              <P>(2) A system for processing complaints alleging discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin to an impartial body.</P>
              <P>(3) A system for processing grievances and appeals (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, disciplinary actions, adverse actions, adverse action appeals, etc).</P>
              <P>(4) Including in the performance appraisal system a factor to rate manager's and supervisors' performance in discharging the EEO program responsibilities assigned to them.</P>
              <P>(5) Reviewing and monitoring the performance appraisal program periodically to determine its objectivity and effectiveness.</P>
              <P>(6) Ensuring the equal availability of employee benefits to all employees.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Program evaluation.</E> An internal reporting system to continually audit, monitor and evaluate programs is essential for a successful AAP. Therefore, a system providing for EEO goals, timetables, and periodic evaluations needs to be established and implemented. Consideration should be given to the following actions:</P>
              <P>a. Defining the major objectives of EEO program evaluation.</P>
              <P>b. The evaluation should be directed toward results accomplished, not only at efforts made.</P>
              <P>c. The evaluation should focus attention on assessing the adequacy of problem identification in the AAP and the extent to which the specific action steps in the plan provide solutions.</P>
              <P>d. The AAP should be reviewed and evaluated at least annually. The review and evaluation procedures should include, but not be limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Each bureau, division or other major component of the agency should make annual and such other periodic reports as are needed to provide an accurate review of the operations of the AAP in that component.</P>
              <P>(2) The AA Officer should make an annual report to the head of the SHA, containing the overall status of the program, results achieved toward established objectives, identity of any particular problems encountered and recommendations for corrective actions needed.</P>
              <P>e. Specific, numerical goals and objectives should be established for the ensuing year. Goals should be developed for the SHA as a whole, as well as for each unit and each job category.</P>
              <P>III. <E T="03">Employment statistical data.</E> A. As a minimum, furnish the most recent data on the following:</P>
              <P>1. The total population in the State,<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
              </P>
              <P>2. The total labor market in State, with a breakdown by racial/ethnic identification and sex, and</P>
              <P>3. An analysis of (1) and (2) above, in connection with the availability of personnel and jobs within SHA's.</P>
              <P>B. State highway agencies shall use the EEO-4 Form in providing current work force data. This data shall reflect only State department of transportation/State highway department employment.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal Highway Administration</E> (<E T="03">FHWA</E>) <E T="03">responsibilities.</E> (1) The FHWA has the responsibility to ensure that contractors meet contractural equal opportunity requirements under E.O. 11246, as amended, and title 23 U.S.C., and to provide guidance and direction to States in the development and implementation of a program to assure compliance with equal opportunity requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) The Federal Highway Administrator or a designee may inquire into the status of any matter affecting the FHWA equal opportunity program and, when considered necessary, assume jurisdiction over the matter, proceeding in coordination with the State concerned. This is without derogation of the authority of the Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation (DOT), the Director, DOT Departmental Office of Civil Rights (OCR) or the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Department of Labor.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure of the State highway agency (SHA) to discharge the responsibilities stated in § 230.405(b)(1) may result in DOT's taking any or all of the following actions (see appendix A to 23 CFR part 630, subpart C “Federal-aid project agreement”):</P>
              <P>(i) Cancel, terminate, or suspend the Federal-aid project agreement in whole or in part;</P>
              <P>(ii) Refrain from extending any further assistance to the SHA under the program with respect to which the failure or refusal occurred until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received from the SHA; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Refer the case to an appropriate Federal agency for legal proceedings.</P>
              <P>(4) Action by the DOT, with respect to noncompliant contractors, shall not relieve a SHA of its responsibilities in connection with these same matters; nor is such action by DOT a substitute for corrective action utilized by a State under applicable State laws or regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State responsibilities.</E> (1) The SHA's, as contracting agencies, have a responsibility to assure compliance by contractors with the requirements of Federal-aid construction contracts, including the equal opportunity requirements, and to assist in and cooperate with FHWA programs to assure equal opportunity.</P>
              <P>(2) The corrective action procedures outlined herein do not preclude normal contract administration procedures by the States to ensure the contractor's completion of specific contract equal opportunity requirements, as long as such procedures support, and sustain the objectives of E.O. 11246, as amended. The State shall inform FHWA of any actions taken against a contractor under normal State contract administration procedures, if that action is precipitated in whole or in part by noncompliance with equal opportunity contract requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contract compliance review procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A compliance review consists of the following elements:</P>
              <P>(1) Review Scheduling (Actions R-1 and R-2).</P>
              <P>(2) Contractor Notification (Action R-3).</P>
              <P>(3) Preliminary Analysis (Phase I) (Action R-4).</P>
              <P>(4) Onsite Verification and Interviews (Phase II) (Action R-5).</P>
              <P>(5) Exit Conference (Action R-6).</P>
              <P>(6) Compliance Determination and Formal Notification (Actions R-8, R-9, R-10, R-11, R-12).</P>
              <FP>The compliance review procedure, as described herein and in appendix D provides for continual monitoring of the employment process. Monitoring officials at all levels shall analyze submissions from field offices to ensure proper completion of procedural requirements and to ascertain the effectiveness of program implementation.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review scheduling.</E> (<E T="03">Actions R-1 and R-2</E>). Because construction work forces are not constant, particular attention should be paid to the proper scheduling of equal opportunity compliance reviews. Priority in scheduling equal opportunity compliance reviews shall be given to reviewing those contractor's work forces:</P>
              <P>(1) Which hold the greatest potential for employment and promotion of minorities and women (particularly in higher skilled crafts or occupations);</P>
              <P>(2) Working in areas which have significant minority and female labor forces within a reasonable recruitment area;</P>
              <P>(3) Working on projects that include special training provisions; and</P>
              <P>(4) Where compliance with equal opportunity requirements is questionable. (Based on previous PR-1391's (23 CFR part 230, subpart A, appendix C) Review Reports and Hometown Plan Reports).</P>
              <FP>In addition, the following considerations shall apply:</FP>
              <P>(5) Reviews specifically requested by the Washington Headquarters shall receive priority scheduling;</P>
              <P>(6) Compliance Reviews in geographical areas covered by areawide plans would normally be reviewed under the Consolidated Compliance Review Procedures set forth in § 230.415.</P>
              <P>(7) Reviews shall be conducted prior to or during peak employment periods.</P>
              <P>(8) No compliance review shall be conducted that is based on a home office work force of less than 15 employees unless requested or approved by Washington Headquarters; and</P>
              <P>(9) For compliance reviews based on an area work force (outside of areawide plan coverage), the Compliance Specialist shall define the applicable geographical area by considering:</P>
              <P>(i) Union geographical boundaries;</P>

              <P>(ii) The geographical area from which the contractor recruits employees, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, reasonable recruitment area;</P>

This notification shall include the scheduled date(s), an outline of the mechanics and basis of the review, requisite interviews, and documents required.</P>

              <P>(2) The contractor shall be requested to provide a meeting place on the day <PRTPAGE P="72"/>of the visit either at the local office of the contractor or at the jobsite.</P>
              <P>(3) The contractor shall be requested to supply all of the following information to the Compliance Specialist prior to the onsite verification and interviews.</P>
              <P>(i) Current Form PR-1391 developed from the most recent payroll;</P>
              <P>(ii) Copies of all current bargaining agreements;</P>
              <P>(iii) Copies of purchase orders and subcontracts containing the EEO clause;</P>
              <P>(iv) A list of recruitment sources available and utilized;</P>
              <P>(v) A statement of the status of any action pertaining to employment practices taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or other Federal, State, or local agency regarding the contractor or any source of employees;</P>

              <P>(4) For a project review, the prime contractor shall be held responsible for ensuring that all active subcontractors are present at the meeting and have supplied the documentation listed in § 230.409(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preliminary analysis</E> (<E T="03">Phase I</E>) (<E T="03">Action R-4</E>). Before the onsite verification and interviews, the Compliance Specialist shall analyze the employment patterns, policies, practices, and programs of the contractor to determine whether or not problems exist by reviewing information relative to:</P>
              <P>(1) The contractor's current work force;</P>
              <P>(2) The contractor's relationship with referral sources, e.g., unions, employment agencies, community action agencies, minority and female organizations, etc.;</P>
              <P>(3) The minority and female representation of sources;</P>
              <P>(4) The availability of minorities and females with requisite skills in a reasonable recruitment area;</P>
              <P>(5) Any pending EEOC or Department of Justice cases or local or State Fair Employment Agency cases which are relevant to the contractor and/or the referral sources; and</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Onsite verification and interviews</E> (<E T="03">Phase II</E>) (<E T="03">Action R-5</E>). (1) Phase II of the review consists of the construction or home office site visit(s). During the initial meeting with the contractor, the following topics shall be discussed:</P>
              <P>(i) Objectives of the visit;</P>
              <P>(ii) The material submitted by the contractor, including the actual implementation of the employee referral source system and any discrepancies found in the material; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Arrangements for the site tour(s) and employee interviews.</P>
              <P>(2) The Compliance Specialist shall make a physical tour of the employment site(s) to determine that:</P>
              <P>(i) EEO posters are displayed in conspicuous places in a legible fashion;</P>
              <P>(ii) Facilities are provided on a nonsegregated basis (e.g. work areas, washroom, timeclocks, locker rooms, storage areas, parking lots, and drinking fountains);</P>
              <P>(iii) Supervisory personnel have been oriented to the contractor's EEO commitments;</P>
              <P>(iv) The employee referral source system is being implemented;</P>
              <P>(v) Reported employment data is accurate;</P>

              <P>(vi) Meetings have been held with employees to discuss EEO policy, particularly new employees; and<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
              </P>
              <P>(vii) Employees are aware of their right to file complaints of discrimination.</P>
              <P>(3) The Compliance Specialist should interview at least one minority, one nonminority, and one woman in each trade, classification, or occupation. The contractor's superintendent or home office manager should also be interviewed.</P>
              <P>(4) The Compliance Specialist shall, on a sample basis, determine the union membership status of union employees on the site (e.g. whether they have permits, membership cards, or books, and in what category they are classified [e.g., A, B, or C]).</P>
              <P>(5) The Compliance Specialist shall also determine the method utilized to place employees on the job and whether equal opportunity requirements have been followed.</P>
              <P>(6) The Compliance Specialist shall determine, and the report shall indicate the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Is there reasonable representation and utilization of minorities and women in each craft, classification or occupation? If not, what has the contractor done to increase recruitment, hiring, upgrading, and training of minorities and women?</P>
              <P>(ii) What action is the contractor taking to meet the contractual requirement to provide equal employment opportunity?</P>
              <P>(iii) Are the actions taken by the contractor acceptable? Could they reasonably be expected to result in increased utilization of minorities and women?</P>
              <P>(iv) Is there impartiality in treatment of minorities and women?</P>
              <P>(v) Are affirmative action measures of an isolated nature or are they continuing?</P>
              <P>(vi) Have the contractor's efforts produced results?</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exit conference</E> (<E T="03">Action R-6</E>). (1) During the exit conference with the contractor, the following topics shall be discussed:</P>
              <P>(i) Any preliminary findings that, if not corrected immediately or not corrected by the adoption of an acceptable voluntary corrective action plan, would necessitate a determination of noncompliance;</P>
              <P>(ii) The process and time in which the contractor shall be informed of the final determination (15 days following the onsite verification and interviews); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other matters that would best be resolved before concluding the onsite portion of the review.</P>
              <P>(2) Voluntary corrective action plans may be negotiated at the exit conference, so that within 15 days following the exit portion of the review, the Compliance Specialist shall prepare the review report and make a determination of either:</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance, and so notify the contractor; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Noncompliance, and issue a 30-day show cause notice.</P>
              <FP>The acceptance of a voluntary corrective action plan at the exit conference does not preclude a determination of noncompliance, particularly if deficiencies not addressed by the plan are uncovered during the final analysis and report writing. (Action R-7) A voluntary corrective action plan should be accepted with the understanding that it only address those problems uncovered prior to the exit conference.</FP>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance determinations</E> (<E T="03">Action R-8</E>). (1) The evidence obtained at the compliance review shall constitute a sufficient basis for an objective determination by the Compliance Specialist conducting the review of the contractor's compliance or noncompliance with contractual provisions pursuant to E.O. 11246, as amended, and FHWA EEO Special Provisions implementing the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, where applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) Compliance determinations on contractors working in a Hometown Plan Area shall reflect the status of those crafts covered by part II of the plan bid conditions. Findings regarding part I crafts shall be transmitted through channels to the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights.</P>
              <P>(3) The compliance status of the contractor will usually be reflected by positive efforts in the following areas:</P>
              <P>(i) The contractor's equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy;</P>

              <P>(ii) Dissemination of the policy and education of supervisory employees concerning their responsibilities in implementing the EEO policy;<PRTPAGE P="74"/>

              <P>(ix) Effective measures to assure nonsegregated facilities, as required by contract provisions;</P>
              <P>(x) The contractor's procedures for monitoring subcontractors and utilization of minority and female subcontractors and/or subcontractors with substantial minority and female employment; and</P>
              <P>(xi) The adequacy of the contractor's records and reports.</P>
              <P>(4) A contractor shall be considered to be in compliance (Action R-9) when the equal opportunity requirements have been effectively implemented, or there is evidence that every good faith effort has been made toward achieving this end. Efforts to acheive this goal shall be result-oriented, initiated and maintained in good faith, and emphasized as any other vital management function.</P>
              <P>(5) A contractor shall be considered to be in noncompliance (Action R-10) when:</P>
              <P>(i) The contractor has discriminated against applicants or employees with respect to the conditions or privileges of employment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The contractor fails to provide evidence of every good faith effort to provide equal opportunity.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Show cause procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Once the onsite verification and exit conference (Action R-5) have been completed and a compliance determination made, (Action R-8), the contractor shall be notified in writing of the compliance determination. (Action R-11 or R-12) This written notification shall be sent to the contractor within 15 days following the completion of the onsite verification and exit conference. If a contractor is found in noncompliance (Action R-10), action efforts to bring the contractor into compliance shall be initiated through the issuance of a show cause notice (Action R-12). The notice shall advise the contractor to show cause within 30 days why sanctions should not be imposed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">When a show cause notice is required.</E> A show cause notice shall be issued when a determination of noncompliance is made based upon:</P>
              <P>(i) The findings of a compliance review;</P>
              <P>(ii) The results of an investigation which verifies the existence of discrimination; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Areawide plan reports that show an underutilization of minorities (based on criteria of U.S. Department of Labor's Optional Form 66 “Manpower Utilization Report”) throughout the contractor's work force covered by part II of the plan bid conditions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Responsibility for issuance.</E> (i) Show cause notices will normally be issued by SHA's to federally assisted contractors when the State has made a determination of noncompliance, or when FHWA has made such a determination and has requested the State to issue the notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) When circumstances warrant, the Regional Federal Highway Administrator or a designee may exercise primary compliance responsibility by issuing the notice directly to the contractor.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Regional Federal Highway Administrators in Regions 8, 10, and the Regional Engineer in Region 15, shall issue show cause notices to direct Federal contractors found in noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Content of show cause notice.</E> The show cause notice must: (See sample—appendix A of this subpart)</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the contractor of the determination of noncompliance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide the basis for the determination of noncompliance;</P>

              <P>(iii) Notify the contractor of the obligation to show cause within 30 days why formal proceedings should not be instituted;<PRTPAGE P="75"/>

              <P>(iv) Schedule (date, time, and place) a compliance conference to be held approximately 15 days from the contractor's receipt of the notice;</P>
              <P>(v) Advise the contractor that the conference will be held to receive and discuss the acceptability of any proposed corrective action plan and/or correction of deficiencies; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Advise the contractor of the availability and willingness of the Compliance Specialist to conciliate within the time limits of the show cause notice.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Preparing and processing the show cause notice.</E> (i) The State or FHWA official who conducted the investigation or review shall develop complete background data for the issuance of the show cause notice and submit the recommendation to the head of the SHA or the Regional Federal Highway Administrator, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(ii) The recommendation, background data, and final draft notice shall be reviewed by appropriate State or FHWA legal counsel.</P>
              <P>(iii) Show cause notices issued by the SHA shall be issued by the head of that agency or a designee.</P>
              <P>(iv) The notice shall be personally served to the contractor or delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, with a certificate of service or the return receipt filed with the case record.</P>
              <P>(v) The date of the contractor's receipt of the show cause notice shall begin the 30-day show cause period. (Action R-13).</P>
              <P>(vi) The 30-day show cause notice shall be issued directly to the noncompliant contractor or subcontractor with an informational copy sent to any concerned prime contractors.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Conciliation efforts during show cause period.</E> (i) The Compliance Specialist is required to attempt conciliation with the contractor throughout the show cause time period. Conciliation and negotiation efforts shall be directed toward correcting contractor program deficiencies and initiating corrective action which will maintain and assure equal opportunity. Records shall be maintained in the State, FHWA division, or FHWA regional office's case files, as appropriate, indicating actions and reactions of the contractor, a brief synopsis of any meetings with the contractor, notes on verbal communication and written correspondence, requests for assistance or interpretations, and other relevant matters.</P>
              <P>(ii) In instances where a contractor is determined to be in compliance after a show cause notice has been issued, the show cause notice will be recinded and the contractor formally notified (Action R-17). The FHWA Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, shall immediately be notified of any change in status.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Corrective action plans.</E> (i) When a contractor is required to show cause and the deficiencies cannot be corrected within the 30-day show cause period, a written corrective action plan may be accepted. The written corrective action plan shall specify clear unequivocal action by the contractor with time limits for completion. Token actions to correct cited deficiencies will not be accepted. (See Sample Corrective Action Plan—appendix B of this subpart)</P>
              <P>(ii) When a contractor submits an acceptable written corrective action plan, the contractor shall be considered in compliance during the plan's effective implementation and submission of required progress reports. (Action R-15 and R-17).</P>
              <P>(iii) When an acceptable corrective action plan is not agreed upon and the contractor does not otherwise show cause as required, the formal hearing process shall be recommended through appropriate channels by the compliance specialist immediately upon expiration of the 30-day show cause period. (Action R-16, R-18, R-19)</P>
              <P>(iv) When a contractor, after having submitted an acceptable corrective action plan and being determined in compliance is subsequently determined to be in noncompliance based upon the contractor's failure to implement the corrective action plan, the formal hearing process must be recommended immediately. There are no provisions for reinstituting a show cause notice.</P>

              <P>(v) When, however, a contractor operating under an acceptable corrective action plan carries out the provisions of the corrective action plan but the actions do not result in the necessary <PRTPAGE P="76"/>changes, the corrective action plan shall be immediately amended through negotiations. If, at this point, the contractor refuses to appropriately amend the corrective action plan, the formal hearing process shall be recommended immediately.</P>

              <P>(vi) A contractor operating under an approved voluntary corrective action plan (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, plan entered into prior to the issuance of a show cause) must be issued a 30-day show cause notice in the situations referred to in paragraphs (h) (7) (iv) and (v) of this section, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, failure to implement an approved corrective action plan or failure of corrective actions to result in necessary changes.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Followup reviews.</E> (1) A followup review is an extension of the initial review process to verify the contractors performance of corrective action and to validate progress report information. Therefore, followup reviews shall only be conducted of those contractors where the initial review resulted in a finding of noncompliance and a show cause notice was issued.</P>
              <P>(2) Followup reviews shall be reported as a narrative summary referencing the initial review report.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Hearing process.</E> (1) When such procedures as show cause issuance and conciliation conferences have been unsuccessful in bringing contractors into compliance within the prescribed 30 days, the reviewer (or other appropriate level) shall immediately recommend, through channels, that the Department of Transportation obtain approval from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs for a formal hearing (Action R-19). The Contractor should be notified of this action.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Extensions of time.</E> Reasonable extensions of time limits set forth in these instructions may be authorized by the SHA's or the FHWA regional office, as appropriate. However, all extensions are subject to Washington Headquarters approval and should only be granted with this understanding. The Federal Highway Administrator shall be notified of all time extensions granted and the justification therefor. In sensitive or special interest cases, simultaneous transmittal of reports and other pertinent documents is authorized.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract completion.</E> Completion of a contract or seasonal shutdown shall not preclude completion of the administrative procedures outlined herein or the possible imposition of sanctions or debarment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Home office reviews outside regions.</E> When contractor's home offices are located outside the FHWA region in which the particular contract is being performed, and it is determined that the contractors' home offices should be reviewed, requests for such reviews with accompanying justification shall be forwarded through appropriate <PRTPAGE P="77"/>channels to the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights. After approval, the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, (OCR) shall request the appropriate region to conduct the home office review.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Employment of women.</E> Executive Order 11246, as amended, implementing rules and regulations regarding sex discrimination are outlined in 41 CFR part 60-20.

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of exclusive referral agreements.</E> (1) The OFCCP has established the following criteria for determining compliance when an exclusive referral agreement is involved;</P>
              <P>(i) It shall be no excuse that the union, with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral, failed to refer minority or female employees.</P>
              <P>(ii) Discrimination in referral for employment, even if pursuant to provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, is prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.</P>
              <P>(iii) Contractors and subcontractors have a responsibility to provide equal opportunity if they want to participate in federally involved contracts. To the extent they have delegated the responsibility for some of their employment practices to some other organization or agency which prevents them from meeting their obligations, these contractors must be found in noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(2) If the contractor indicates that union action or inaction is a proximate cause of the contractor's failure to provide equal opportunity, a finding of noncompliance will be made and a show cause notice issued, and:</P>
              <P>(i) The contractor will be formally directed to comply with the equal opportunity requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reviews of other contractors with projects within the jurisdiction of the applicable union locals shall be scheduled.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the reviews indicate a pattern and/or practice of discrimination on the part of specific union locals, each contractor in the area shall be informed of the criteria outlined in § 230.411(e)(1) of this section. Furthermore, the FHWA Washington Headquarters, OCR, shall be provided with full documentary evidence to support the discriminatory pattern indicated.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event the union referral practices prevent the contractor from meeting the equal opportunity requirements pursuant to the E.O. 11246, as amended, such contractor shall immediately notify the SHA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Consolidated compliance reviews.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Consolidated compliance reviews shall be implemented to determine employment opportunities on an areawide rather than an individual project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach shall be adopted and directed by either Headquarters, region, division, or SHA, however, consolidated reviews shall at all times remain a cooperative effort.</P>
              <P>(b) OFCCP policy requires contracting agencies to ensure compliance, in hometown an imposed plan areas, on an areawide rather than a project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach facilitates implementation of this policy.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Methodology</E>—(1) <E T="03">Selection of a target area.</E> In identifying the target area of a consolidated compliance review (e.g. SMSA, hometown or imposed plan area, a multicounty area, or an entire State), consideration shall at least be given to the following facts:</P>
              <P>(i) Minority and female work force concentrations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Suspected or alleged discrimination in union membership or referral practices by local unions involved in highway construction;</P>
              <P>(iii) Present or potential problem areas;</P>
              <P>(iv) The number of highway projects in the target area; and</P>
              <P>(v) Hometown or imposed plan reports that indicate underutilization of minorities or females.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determine the review period.</E> After the target area has been selected, the dates for the actual onsite reviews shall be established.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Obtain background information.</E> EEO-3's Local Union Reports, should be obtained from regional offices of the EEOC. Target area civilian labor force statistics providing percent minorities and percent females in the target area shall be obtained from State employment security agencies or similar State agencies.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Identify contractors.</E> Every nonexempt federally assisted or direct Federal contractor and subcontractor in the target area shall be identified. In order to establish areawide employment patterns in the target area, employment data is needed for all contractors and subcontractors in the area. However, only those contractors with significant work forces (working prior to peak and not recently reviewed) may need to be actually reviwed onsite. Accordingly, once all contractors are identified, those contractors which will actually be reviewed onsite shall be determined. Compliance determinations shall only reflect the status of crafts covered by part II of plan bid conditions. Employment data of crafts covered by part I of plan bid conditions shall be gathered and identified as such in the composite report, however, OFCCP has reserved the responsibility for compliance determinations on crafts covered by part I of the plan bid conditions.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Contractor notification.</E> Those contractors selected for onsite review shall be sent a notification letter as outlined in § 230.409(c) along with a request for current workforce data <SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> for completion <PRTPAGE P="80"/>and submission at the onsite review. Those contractors in the target area not selected for onsite review shall also be requested to supply current workforce data as of the onsite review period, and shall return the data within 15 days following the onsite review period.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>2</SU> The Consolidated Workforce Questionnaire is convenient for the purpose and appears as attachment 4 to volume 2, chapter 2, <PRTPAGE/>section 3 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, which is available at the offices listed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Onsite reviews.</E> Compliance reviews shall then be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 230.409. Reviewers may use Form FHWA-86, Compliance Data Report, if appropriate. It is of particular importance during the onsite reviews that the review team provide for adequate coordination of activities at every stage of the review process.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Compliance determinations.</E> Upon completion of the consolidated reviews, compliance determinations shall be made on each review by the reviewer. Individual show cause notices or compliance notifications shall be sent (as appropriate) to each reviewed contractor.</P>
              <FP>The compliance determination shall be based on the contractor's target area work force (Federal, Federal-aid and non-Federal), except when the target area is coincidental with hometown plan area, compliance determinations must not be based on that part of a contractor's work force covered by part I of the plan bid conditions, as previously set forth in this regulation. For example: ABC Contracting, Inc. employs carpenters, operating engineers, and cement masons. Carpenters and operating engineers are covered by part II of the plan bid conditions, however, cement masons are covered by part I of the plan bid conditions. The compliance determination must be based only on the contractor's utilization of carpenters and operating engineers.</FP>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reporting</E>—(1) <E T="03">Composite report.</E> A final composite report shall be submitted as a complete package to the Washington Headquarters, OCR, within 45 days after the review period and shall consist of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance review report, for each contractor and subcontractor with accompanying show cause notice or compliance notification.</P>
              <P>(ii) Work force data to show the aggregate employment of all contractors in the target area.</P>
              <P>(iii) A narrative summary of findings and recommendations to include the following:</P>
              <P>(A) A summary of highway construction employment in the target area by craft, race, and sex. This summary should explore possible patterns of discrimination or underutilization and possible causes, and should compare the utilization of minorities and females on contractor's work forces to the civilian labor force percent for minorities and females in the target area.</P>
              <P>(B) If the target area is a plan area, a narrative summary of the plan's effectiveness with an identification of part I and part II crafts. This summary shall discuss possible differences in minority and female utilization between part I and part II crafts, documenting any inferences drawn from such comparisons.</P>
              <P>(C) If applicable, discuss local labor unions' membership and/or referral practices that impact on the utilization of minorities and females in the target area. Complete and current copies of all collective bargaining agreements and copies of EEO-3, Local Union Reports, for all appropriate unions shall accompany the composite report.</P>
              <P>(D) Any other appropriate data, analyses, or information deemed necessary for a complete picture of the areawide employment.</P>
              <P>(E) Considering the information compiled from the summaries listed above, make concrete recommendations on possible avenues for correcting problems uncovered by the analyses.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Annual planning report.</E> The proper execution of consolidated compliance reviews necessitates scheduling, along with other fiscal program planning. The Washington Headquarters, OCR, shall be notified of all planned consolidated reviews by August 10 of each year and of any changes in the target area or review periods, as they become known. The annual consolidated planning report shall indicate:</P>
              <P>(i) Selected target areas:<PRTPAGE P="81"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The basis for selection of each area; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The anticipated review period (dates) for each target area.</P>

                <E T="04">Dear Contractor:</E> As a result of the review of your (Project Number) project located at (Project Location) conducted on (Date) by (Reviewing Agency), it is our determination that you are not in compliance with your equal opportunity requirements and that good faith efforts have not been made to meet your equal opportunity requirements in the following areas:</P>

              </P>
              <P>Your failure to take the contractually required affirmative action has contributed to the unacceptable level of minority and female employment in your operations, particularly in the semiskilled and skilled categories of employees.</P>
              <P>The Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR 60) implementing Executive Order 11246, as amended, are applicable to your Federal-aid highway construction contract and are controlling in this matter (see Required Contract Provisions, Form PR-1273, Clause II). Section 60-1.20(b) of these regulations provides that when equal opportunity deficiencies exist, it is necessary that you make a commitment in writing to correct such deficiencies before you may be found in compliance. The commitment must include the specific action which you propose to take to correct each deficiency and the date of completion of such action. The time period allotted shall be no longer than the minimum period necessary to effect the necessary correction. In accordance with instructions issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), U.S. Department of Labor, your written commitment must also provide for the submission of monthly progress reports which shall include a head count of minority and female representation at each level of each trade and a list of minority employees.</P>
              <P>You are specifically advised that making the commitment discussed above will not preclude a further determination of noncompliance upon a finding that the commitment is not sufficient to achieve compliance.</P>
              <P>We will hold a compliance conference at ________(Address) at ________ (Time) on ________(Date) for you to submit and discuss your written commitment. If your written commitment is acceptable and if the commitment is sufficient to achieve compliance, you will be found in compliance during the effective implementation of that commitment. You are cautioned, however, that our determination is subject to review by the Federal Highway Administration, the Department of Transportation, and OFCCP and may be disapproved if your written commitment is not considered sufficient to achieve compliance.</P>
              <P>If you indicate either directly or by inaction that you do not wish to participate in the scheduled conference and do not otherwise show cause within 30 days from receipt of this notice why enforcement proceedings should not be instituted, this agency will commence enforcement proceedings under Executive Order 11246, as amended.</P>
              <P>If your written commitment is accepted and it is subsequently found that you have failed to comply with its provisions, you will be advised of this determination and formal sanction proceedings will be instituted immediately.</P>
              <P>In the event formal sanction proceedings are instituted and the final determination is that a violation of your equal opportunity contract requirements has taken place, any Federal-aid highway construction contracts or subcontracts which you hold may be canceled, terminated, or suspended, and you may be debarred from further such contracts or subcontracts. Such other sanctions as are authorized by Executive Order 11246, as amended, may also be imposed.</P>
              <P>We encourage you to take whatever action is necessary to resolve this matter and are anxious to assist you in achieving compliance. Any questions concerning this notice should be addressed to (Name, Address, and Phone).</P>

              <P>Deficiency 1: Sources likely to yield minority employees have not been contacted for recruitment purposes.</P>

              <P>Commitment: We have developed a system of written job applications at our home office which readily identifies minority applicants. In addition to this, as a minimum, we will contact the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), League of Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Urban League, and the Employment Security Office within 20 days to establish a referral system for minority group applicants and expand our recruitment base. We are in the process of identifying other community organizations and associations that may be able to provide minority applicants and will <PRTPAGE P="82"/>submit an updated listing of recruitment sources and evidence of contact by ________(Date).</P>
              <P>Deficiency 2: There have been inadequate efforts to locate, qualify, and increase skills of minority and female employees and applicants for employment.</P>
              <P>Commitment: We will set up an individual file for each apprentice or trainee by ______(Date) in order to carefully screen the progress, ensure that they are receiving the necessary training, and being promoted promptly upon completion of training requirements.

              <SUBJECT>What is the FHWA's policy on use of FHWA planning and research funds?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the FHWA determines that planning activities of national significance, identified in paragraph (b) of this section, and the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134, 135, 303, and 505 are being adequately addressed, the FHWA will allow State DOTs and MPOs:</P>
              <P>(1) Maximum possible flexibility in the use of FHWA planning and research funds to meet highway and local public transportation planning and RD&amp;T needs at the national, State, and local levels while ensuring legal use of such funds and avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts; and</P>

              <P>(2) To determine which eligible planning and RD&amp;T activities they desire <PRTPAGE P="92"/>to support with FHWA planning and research funds and at what funding level.</P>
              <P>(b) The State DOTs must provide data that support the FHWA's responsibilities to the Congress and to the public. These data include, but are not limited to, information required for: preparing proposed legislation and reports to the Congress; evaluating the extent, performance, condition, and use of the Nation's transportation systems; analyzing existing and proposed Federal-aid funding methods and levels and the assignment of user cost responsibility; maintaining a critical information base on fuel availability, use, and revenues generated; and calculating apportionment factors.</P>
              <P>(c) The policy in paragraph (a) of this section does not remove the FHWA's responsibility and authority to determine which activities are eligible for funding. Activities proposed to be funded with FHWA planning and research funds by the State DOTs and their subrecipients shall be documented and submitted for FHWA approval and authorization as prescribed in §§ 420.111 and 420.113. (The information collection requirements in paragraph (b) of § 420.105 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control numbers 2125-0028 and 2125-0032.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the minimum required expenditure of State planning and research funds for research development and technology transfer?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A State DOT must expend no less than 25 percent of its annual SPR funds on RD&amp;T activities relating to highway, public transportation, and intermodal transportation systems in accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 505(b), unless a State DOT certifies, and the FHWA accepts the State DOT's certification, that total expenditures by the State DOT during the fiscal year for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135 will exceed 75 percent of the amount apportioned for the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(b) Prior to submitting a request for an exception to the 25 percent requirement, the State DOT must ensure that:</P>
              <P>(1) The additional planning activities are essential, and there are no other reasonable options available for funding these planning activities (including the use of NHS, STP, MG, or FTA State planning and research funds (49 U.S.C. 5313(b)) or by deferment of lower priority planning activities);</P>
              <P>(2) The planning activities have a higher priority than RD&amp;T activities in the overall needs of the State DOT for a given fiscal year; and</P>
              <P>(3) The total level of effort by the State DOT in RD&amp;T (using both Federal and State funds) is adequate.</P>
              <P>(c) If the State DOT chooses to pursue an exception, it must send the request, along with supporting justification, to the FHWA Division Administrator for action by the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology. The Associate Administrator's decision will be based upon the following considerations:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the State DOT has a process for identifying RD&amp;T needs and for implementing a viable RD&amp;T program.</P>
              <P>(2) Whether the State DOT is contributing to cooperative RD&amp;T programs or activities, such as the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, the Transportation Research Board, and transportation pooled fund studies.</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the State DOT is using SPR funds for technology transfer and for transit or intermodal research and development to help meet the 25 percent minimum requirement.</P>
              <P>(4) Whether the State DOT can demonstrate that it will meet the requirement or substantially increase its RD&amp;T expenditures over a multi-year period, if an exception is granted for the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(5) Whether Federal funds needed for planning exceed the 75 percent limit for the fiscal year and whether any unused planning funds are available from previous fiscal years.</P>
              <P>(d) If the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology approves the State DOT's request for an exception, the exception is valid only for that fiscal year's funds. A new request must be submitted and approved for subsequent fiscal year funds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for distribution of metropolitan planning funds?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The State DOTs shall make all PL funds authorized by 23 U.S.C. 104(f) available to the MPOs in accordance with a formula developed by the State DOT, in consultation with the MPOs, and approved by the FHWA Division Administrator. The formula may allow for a portion of the PL funds to be used by the State DOT, or other agency agreed to by the State DOT and the MPOs, for activities that benefit all MPOs in the State, but State DOTs shall not use any PL funds for grant or subgrant administration. The formula may also provide for a portion of the funds to be made available for discretionary grants to MPOs to supplement their annual amount received under the distribution formula.</P>
              <P>(b) In developing the formula for distributing PL funds, the State DOT shall consider population, status of planning, attainment of air quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution of funds to carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable requirements of Federal law.</P>
              <P>(c) The State DOTs shall inform the MPOs and the FHWA Division Office of the amounts allocated to each MPO as soon as possible after PL funds have been apportioned by the FHWA to the State DOTs.</P>
              <P>(d) If the State DOT, in a State receiving the minimum apportionment of PL funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(2), determines that the share of funds to be allocated to any MPO results in the MPO receiving more funds than necessary to carry out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134, the State DOT may, after considering the views of the affected MPO(s) and with the approval of the FHWA Division Administrator, use those funds for transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas.</P>
              <P>(e) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(n), any PL funds not needed for carrying out the metropolitan planning provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134 in any State may be made available by the MPO(s) to the State DOT for funding statewide planning activities under 23 U.S.C. 135, subject to approval by the FHWA Division Administrator.</P>
              <P>(f) Any State PL fund distribution formula that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be brought into conformance with those requirements before distribution on any new apportionment of PL funds.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 420.111</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are the documentation requirements for use of FHWA planning and research funds?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Proposed use of FHWA planning and research funds must be documented by the State DOTs and subrecipients in a work program, or other document that describes the work to be accomplished, that is acceptable to the FHWA Division Administrator. Statewide, metropolitan, other transportation planning activities, and transportation RD&amp;T activities may be documented in separate programs, paired in various combinations, or brought together as a single work program. The expenditure of PL funds for transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas under § 420.109(d) may be included in the work program for statewide transportation planning activities or in a separate work program submitted by the State DOT.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A work program(s) for transportation planning activities must include a description of work to be accomplished and cost estimates by activity or task. In addition, each work program must include a summary that shows:</P>
              <P>(i) Federal share by type of fund;</P>
              <P>(ii) Matching rate by type of fund;</P>
              <P>(iii) State and/or local matching share; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Other State or local funds.</P>
              <P>(2) Additional information on metropolitan planning area work programs is contained in 23 CFR part 450. Additional information on RD&amp;T work program content and format is contained in subpart B of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) In areas not designated as TMAs, a simplified statement of work that describes who will perform the work and the work that will be accomplished using Federal funds may be used in lieu of a work program. If a simplified statement of work is used, it may be <PRTPAGE P="94"/>submitted separately or as part of the Statewide planning work program.</P>
              <P>(d) The State DOTs that use separate Federal-aid projects in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must submit an overall summary that identifies the amounts and sources of FHWA planning and research funds available, matching funds, and the amounts budgeted for each activity (e.g., statewide planning, RD&amp;T, each metropolitan area, contributions to NCHRP and transportation pooled fund studies, etc.).</P>
              <P>(e) The State DOTs and MPOs also are encouraged to include cost estimates for transportation planning, research, development, and technology transfer related activities funded with other Federal or State and/or local funds; particularly for producing the FHWA-required data specified in paragraph (b) of § 420.105, for planning for other transportation modes, and for air quality planning activities in areas designated as non-attainment for transportation-related pollutants in their work programs. The MPOs in TMAs must include such information in their work programs. (The information collection requirements in §§ 420.111 have been approved by the OMB and assigned control numbers 2125-0039 for States and 2132-0529 for MPOs.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>What costs are eligible?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Costs will be eligible for FHWA participation provided that the costs:</P>
              <P>(1) Are for work performed for activities eligible under the section of title 23, U.S.C., applicable to the class of funds used for the activities;</P>
              <P>(2) Are verifiable from the State DOT's or the subrecipient's records;</P>
              <P>(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project objectives and meet the other criteria for allowable costs in the applicable cost principles cited in 49 CFR 18.22;</P>
              <P>(4) Are included in the approved budget, or amendment thereto; and</P>
              <P>(5) Were not incurred prior to FHWA authorization.</P>
              <P>(b) Indirect costs of State DOTs and their subrecipients are allowable if supported by a cost allocation plan and indirect cost proposal prepared, submitted (if required), and approved by the cognizant or oversight agency in accordance with the OMB requirements applicable to the State DOT or subrecipient specified in 49 CFR 18.22(b).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 420.115</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are the FHWA approval and authorization requirements?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The State DOT and its subrecipients must obtain approval and authorization to proceed prior to beginning work on activities to be undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds. Such approvals and authorizations should be based on final work programs or other documents that describe the work to be performed. The State DOT and its subrecipients also must obtain prior approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified in 49 CFR 18.30 or 49 CFR 19.25 and for those items of allowable costs which require approval in accordance with the cost principles specified in 49 CFR 18.22(b) applicable to the entity expending the funds.</P>
              <P>(b) Authorization to proceed with the FHWA funded work in whole or in part is a contractual obligation of the Federal government pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 106 and requires that appropriate funds be available for the full Federal share of the cost of work authorized. Those State DOTs that do not have sufficient FHWA planning and research funds or obligation authority available to obligate the full Federal share of a work program or project may utilize the advance construction provisions of 23 U.S.C. 115(a) in accordance with the requirements of 23 CFR part 630, subpart G. The State DOTs that do not meet the advance construction provisions, or do not wish to utilize them, may request authorization to proceed with that portion of the work for which FHWA planning and research funds are available. In the latter case, authorization to proceed may be given for either selected work activities or for a portion of the program period, but such authorization does not constitute a commitment by the FHWA to fund the remaining portion of the work if additional funds do become available.</P>

              <P>(c) A project agreement must be executed by the State DOT and the FHWA Division Office for each statewide transportation planning, metropolitan <PRTPAGE P="95"/>planning area, or RD&amp;T work program, individual activity or study, or any combination administered as a single Federal-aid project. The project agreement may be executed concurrent with or after authorization has been given by the FHWA Division Administrator to proceed with the work in whole or in part. In the event that the project agreement is executed for only part of the work, the project agreement must be amended when authorization is given to proceed with additional work.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the fiscal requirements?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The maximum rate of Federal participation for FHWA planning and research funds shall be as prescribed in title 23, U.S.C., for the specific class of funds used (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> SPR, PL, NHS, STP, or MG) except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The provisions of 49 CFR 18.24 or 49 CFR 19.23 are applicable to any necessary matching of FHWA planning and research funds.</P>

              <P>(b) The value of third party in-kind contributions may be accepted as the match for FHWA planning and research funds, in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.24(a)(2) or 49 CFR 19.23(a) and may be on either a total planning work program basis or for specific line items or projects. The use of third party in-kind contributions must be identified in the original work program/scope of work and the grant/<PRTPAGE P="96"/>subgrant agreement, or amendments thereto. The use of third-party in-kind contributions must be approved in advance by the FHWA Division Administrator and may not be made retroactive prior to approval of the work program/scope of work or an amendment thereto. The State DOT or subrecipient is responsible for ensuring that the following additional criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The third party performing the work agrees to allow the value of the work to be used as the match;</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of the third party work is not paid for by other Federal funds or used as a match for other federally funded grants/subgrants;</P>
              <P>(3) The work performed by the third party is an eligible transportation planning or RD&amp;T related activity that benefits the federally funded work;</P>
              <P>(4) The third party costs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> salaries, fringe benefits, etc.) are allowable under the applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> OMB Circular A-21, A-87, or A-122);<SU>1</SU>

              <P>(5) The third party work is performed during the period to which the matching requirement applies;</P>
              <P>(6) The third party in-kind contributions are verifiable from the records of the State DOT or subrecipient and these records show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived; and</P>
              <P>(7) If the total amount of third party expenditures at the end of the program period is not sufficient to match the total expenditure of Federal funds by the recipient/subrecipient, the recipient/subrecipient will need to make up any shortfall with its own funds.</P>
              <P>(c) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 120(j), toll revenues that are generated and used by public, quasi-public, and private agencies to build, improve, or maintain highways, bridges, or tunnels that serve the public purpose of interstate commerce may be used as a credit for the non-Federal share of an FHWA planning and research funded project.</P>
              <P>(d) In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 505(c) or 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(3), the requirement for matching SPR or PL funds may be waived if the FHWA determines the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be best served. Waiver of the matching requirement is intended to encourage State DOTs and/or MPOs to pool SPR and/or PL funds to address national or regional high priority planning or RD&amp;T problems that would benefit multiple States and/or MPOs. Requests for waiver of matching requirements must be submitted to the FHWA headquarters office for approval by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Environment (for planning activities) or the Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology (for RD&amp;T activities). The matching requirement may not be waived for NHS, STP, or MG funds.</P>
              <P>(e) NHS, STP, or MG funds used for eligible planning and RD&amp;T purposes must be identified separately from SPR or PL funds in the work program(s) and must be administered and accounted for separately for fiscal purposes. In accordance with the statewide and metropolitan planning process requirements for fiscally constrained transportation improvement program (TIPs) planning or RD&amp;T activities funded with NHS, STP, or MG funds must be included in the Statewide and/or metropolitan TIP(s) unless the State DOT and MPO (for a metropolitan area) agree that they may be excluded from the TIP.</P>
              <P>(f) Payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.21 or 49 CFR 19.22.</P>

The certification must consist of a statement signed by the Administrator, or an official designated by the Administrator, of the State DOT certifying as follows: “I (name of certifying official), (position title), of the State (Commonwealth) of ____, do hereby <PRTPAGE P="101"/>certify that the State (Commonwealth) is in compliance with all requirements of 23 U.S.C. 505 and its implementing regulations with respect to the research, development, and technology transfer program, and contemplate no changes in statutes, regulations, or administrative procedures which would affect such compliance.”</P>
              <P>(d) The FHWA Division Administrator shall periodically review the State DOT's management process to determine if the State is in compliance with the requirements of this subpart. If the Division Administrator determines that a State DOT is not complying with the requirements of this subpart, or is not performing in accordance with its RD&amp;T management process, the FHWA Division Administrator shall issue a written notice of proposed determination of noncompliance to the State DOT. The notice will set forth the reasons for the proposed determination and inform the State DOT that it may reply in writing within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice. The State DOT's reply should address the deficiencies cited in the notice and provide documentation as necessary. If the State DOT and the Division Administrator cannot resolve the differences set forth in the determination of nonconformity, the State DOT may appeal to the Federal Highway Administrator whose action shall constitute the final decision of the FHWA. An adverse decision shall result in immediate withdrawal of approval of FHWA planning and research funds for the State DOT's RD&amp;T activities until the State DOT is in full compliance.</P>

              <P>Unless otherwise specified, the definitions in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and 49 U.S.C. 5302 are applicable to this part.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Administrative modification</E> means a minor revision to a long-range statewide or metropolitan transportation plan, Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), or Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) that includes minor changes to project/project phase costs, minor changes to funding sources of previously included projects, and minor changes to project/project phase initiation dates. An administrative modification is a revision that does not require public review and comment, a redemonstration of fiscal constraint, or a conformity determination (in nonattainment and maintenance areas).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Amendment</E> means a revision to a long-range statewide or metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, or STIP that involves a major change to a project included in a metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, or STIP, including the addition or deletion of a project or a major change in project cost, project/project phase initiation dates, or a major change in design concept or design scope (e.g., changing project termini or the number of through traffic lanes or changing the number of stations in the case of fixed guideway transit projects). Changes to projects that are included only for illustrative purposes do not require an amendment. An amendment is a revision that requires public review and comment and a redemonstration of fiscal constraint. If an amendment involves “non-exempt” projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas, a conformity determination is required.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Asset management</E> means a strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets, with a focus on both engineering and economic analysis based upon quality information, to identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement actions that will achieve and sustain a desired state of good repair over the lifecycle of the assets at minimum practicable cost.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Attainment area</E> means any geographic area in which levels of a given criteria air pollutant (e.g., ozone, carbon monoxide, PM<E T="52">10</E>, PM<E T="52">2.5</E>, and nitrogen dioxide) meet the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for that pollutant. An area may be an attainment area for one pollutant and a nonattainment area for others. A “maintenance area” (see definition in this section) is not considered an attainment area for transportation planning purposes.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Available funds</E> means funds derived from an existing source dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes. For Federal funds, authorized and/or appropriated funds and the extrapolation of formula and discretionary funds at historic rates of increase are considered “available.” A similar approach may be used for State and local funds that are dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Committed funds</E> means funds that have been dedicated or obligated for transportation purposes. For State funds that are not dedicated to transportation purposes, only those funds over which the Governor has control <PRTPAGE P="103"/>may be considered “committed.” Approval of a TIP by the Governor is considered a commitment of those funds over which the Governor has control. For local or private sources of funds not dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes (including donations of property), a commitment in writing (e.g., letter of intent) by the responsible official or body having control of the funds may be considered a commitment. For projects involving 49 U.S.C. 5309 funding, execution of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (or equivalent) or an Expedited Grant Agreement (or equivalent) with the DOT shall be considered a multiyear commitment of Federal funds.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Conformity</E> means a Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)) requirement that ensures that Federal funding and approval are given to transportation plans, programs and projects that are consistent with the air quality goals established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP). Conformity to the purpose of the SIP means that transportation activities will not cause new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely attainment of the NAAQS or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones in any nonattainment or maintenance area. The transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A) sets forth policy, criteria, and procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity of transportation activities.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Conformity lapse</E> means, pursuant to section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)), as amended, that the conformity determination for a metropolitan transportation plan or TIP has expired and thus there is no currently conforming metropolitan transportation plan or TIP.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Congestion Management Process</E> means a systematic approach required in transportation management areas (TMAs) that provides for effective management and operation, based on a cooperatively developed and implemented metropolitan-wide strategy, of new and existing transportation facilities eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C., and title 49 U.S.C., through the use of travel demand reduction and operational management strategies.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Consideration</E> means that one or more parties takes into account the opinions, action, and relevant information from other parties in making a decision or determining a course of action.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Consultation</E> means that one or more parties confer with other identified parties in accordance with an established process and, prior to taking action(s), considers the views of the other parties and periodically informs them about action(s) taken. This definition does not apply to the “consultation” performed by the States and the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in comparing the long-range statewide transportation plan and the metropolitan transportation plan, respectively, to State and tribal conservation plans or maps or inventories of natural or historic resources (see section 450.216(j) and sections 450.324(g)(1) and (g)(2)).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Cooperation</E> means that the parties involved in carrying out the transportation planning and programming processes work together to achieve a common goal or objective.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Design scope</E> means the aspects that will affect the proposed facility's impact on the region, usually as they relate to vehicle or person carrying capacity and control (e.g., number of lanes or tracks to be constructed or added, length of project, signalization, <PRTPAGE P="104"/>safety features, access control including approximate number and location of interchanges, or preferential treatment for high-occupancy vehicles).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Designated recipient</E> means an entity designated, in accordance with the planning process under 49 U.S.C. 5303 and 5304, by the Governor of a State, responsible local officials, and publicly owned operators of public transportation, to receive and apportion amounts under 49 U.S.C. 5336 that are attributable to urbanized areas of 200,000 or more in population, or a State or regional authority if the authority is responsible under the laws of a State for a capital project and for financing and directly providing public transportation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Environmental mitigation activities</E> means strategies, policies, programs, and actions that, over time, will serve to avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce or eliminate impacts to environmental resources associated with the implementation of a long-range statewide transportation plan or metropolitan transportation plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Development and content of the statewide transportation improvement program (STIP).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The State shall develop a statewide transportation improvement program (STIP) for all areas of the State. The STIP shall cover a period of no less than 4 years and shall be updated at least every 4 years, or more frequently if the Governor of the State elects a more frequent update cycle. However, if the STIP covers more than 4 years, the FHWA and the FTA will consider the projects in the additional years as informational. In case of difficulties developing a portion of the STIP for a particular area (e.g., metropolitan planning area, nonattainment or maintenance area, or Indian Tribal lands), the State may develop a partial STIP covering the rest of the State.</P>

              <P>(b) For each metropolitan area in the State, the State shall develop the STIP in cooperation with the MPO designated for the metropolitan area. The State shall include each metropolitan TIP without change in the STIP, directly or by reference, after approval of the TIP by the MPO and the Governor. A metropolitan TIP in a nonattainment or maintenance area is subject to a FHWA/FTA conformity finding before inclusion in the STIP. In areas outside a metropolitan planning area but within an air quality nonattainment or maintenance area containing any part <PRTPAGE P="117"/>of a metropolitan area, projects must be included in the regional emissions analysis that supported the conformity determination of the associated metropolitan TIP before they are added to the STIP.</P>
              <P>(c) For each nonmetropolitan area in the State, the State shall develop the STIP in cooperation with affected nonmetropolitan local officials with responsibility for transportation or, if applicable, through RTPOs described in § 450.210(d) using the State's consultation process(es) established under § 450.210(b).</P>
              <P>(d) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian Tribal government, the STIP shall be developed in consultation with the Tribal government and the Secretary of the Interior.</P>
              <P>(e) Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program TIPs shall be included without change in the STIP, directly or by reference, once approved by the FHWA pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201(c)(4).</P>
              <P>(f) The Governor shall provide all interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed STIP as required by § 450.210(a).</P>
              <P>(g) The STIP shall include capital and non-capital surface transportation projects (or phases of projects) within the boundaries of the State proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (including transportation alternatives and associated transit improvements; Tribal Transportation Program projects, Federal Lands Transportation Program projects, and Federal Lands Access Program projects; HSIP projects; trails projects; and accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle facilities), except the following that may be included:</P>
              <P>(1) Safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 402 and 49 U.S.C. 31102;</P>
              <P>(2) Metropolitan planning projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(d) and 49 U.S.C. 5305(d);</P>
              <P>(3) State planning and research projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 505 and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e);</P>
              <P>(4) State planning and research projects funded with Surface Transportation Program funds;</P>
              <P>(5) Emergency relief projects (except those involving substantial functional, locational, or capacity changes);</P>
              <P>(6) Research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5312, and technical assistance and standards development projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5314;</P>
              <P>(7) Project management oversight projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5327; and</P>
              <P>(8) State safety oversight programs funded under 49 U.S.C. 5329.</P>
              <P>(h) The STIP shall contain all regionally significant projects requiring an action by the FHWA or the FTA whether or not the projects are to be funded with 23 U.S.C. Chapters 1 and 2 or title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 funds (e.g., addition of an interchange to the Interstate System with State, local, and/or private funds, and congressionally designated projects not funded under title 23 U.S.C. or title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). For informational and conformity purposes, the STIP shall include (if appropriate and included in any TIPs) all regionally significant projects proposed to be funded with Federal funds other than those administered by the FHWA or the FTA, as well as all regionally significant projects to be funded with non-Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(i) The STIP shall include for each project or phase (e.g., preliminary engineering, environment/NEPA, right-of-way, design, or construction) the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Sufficient descriptive material (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> type of work, termini, and length) to identify the project or phase;</P>
              <P>(2) Estimated total project cost or a project cost range, which may extend beyond the 4 years of the STIP;</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of Federal funds proposed to be obligated during each program year. For the first year, this includes the proposed category of Federal funds and source(s) of non-Federal funds. For the second, third, and fourth years, this includes the likely category or possible categories of Federal funds and sources of non-Federal funds; and</P>
              <P>(4) Identification of the agencies responsible for carrying out the project or phase.</P>

              <P>(j) Projects that are not considered to be of appropriate scale for individual <PRTPAGE P="118"/>identification in a given program year may be grouped by function, work type, and/or geographic area using the applicable classifications under 23 CFR 771.117(c) and (d) and/or 40 CFR part 93. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, project classifications must be consistent with the “exempt project” classifications contained in the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). In addition, projects proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. Chapter 2 that are not regionally significant may be grouped in one line item or identified individually in the STIP.</P>
              <P>(k) Each project or project phase included in the STIP shall be consistent with the long-range statewide transportation plan developed under § 450.216 and, in metropolitan planning areas, consistent with an approved metropolitan transportation plan developed under § 450.324.</P>
              <P>(l) The STIP may include a financial plan that demonstrates how the approved STIP can be implemented, indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be available to carry out the STIP, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that would be included in the adopted STIP if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available. The State is not required to select any project from the illustrative list for implementation, and projects on the illustrative list cannot be advanced to implementation without an action by the FHWA and the FTA on the STIP. Revenue and cost estimates for the STIP must use an inflation rate to reflect “year of expenditure dollars,” based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed cooperatively by the State, MPOs, and public transportation operators.</P>
              <P>(m) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, projects included in the first 2 years of the STIP shall be limited to those for which funds are available or committed. Financial constraint of the STIP shall be demonstrated and maintained by year and shall include sufficient financial information to demonstrate which projects are to be implemented using current and/or reasonably available revenues, while federally supported facilities are being adequately operated and maintained. In the case of proposed funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified in the financial plan consistent with paragraph (l) of this section.

              <SUBJECT>Metropolitan planning organization designation and redesignation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To carry out the metropolitan transportation planning process under this subpart, an MPO shall be designated for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000 individuals (as determined by the Bureau of the Census).</P>
              <P>(b) MPO designation shall be made by agreement between the Governor and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census) or in accordance with procedures established by applicable State or local law.</P>
              <P>(c) The FHWA and the FTA shall identify as a TMA each urbanized area with a population of over 200,000 individuals, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. The FHWA and the FTA shall also designate any urbanized area as a TMA on the request of the Governor and the MPO designated for that area.</P>
              <P>(d) TMA structure:</P>
              <P>(1) Not later than October 1, 2014, each metropolitan planning organization that serves a designated TMA shall consist of:</P>
              <P>(i) Local elected officials;</P>
              <P>(ii) Officials of public agencies that administer or operate major modes of transportation in the metropolitan area, including representation by providers of public transportation; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Appropriate State officials.</P>
              <P>(2) An MPO may be restructured to meet the requirements of this paragraph (d) without undertaking a redesignation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Representation</E>. (i) Designation or selection of officials or representatives under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be determined by the MPO according to the bylaws or enabling statute of the organization.</P>
              <P>(ii) Subject to the bylaws or enabling statute of the MPO, a representative of a provider of public transportation may also serve as a representative of a local municipality.</P>
              <P>(iii) An official described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) shall have responsibilities, actions, duties, voting rights, and any other authority commensurate with other officials described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with the authority, under any State law in effect on December 18, 1991, of a public agency with multimodal transportation responsibilities—</P>
              <P>(i) To develop the plans and TIPs for adoption by an MPO; and</P>

              <P>(ii) To develop long-range capital plans, coordinate transit services and <PRTPAGE P="125"/>projects, and carry out other activities pursuant to State law.</P>
              <P>(e) To the extent possible, only one MPO shall be designated for each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than one MPO may be designated to serve an urbanized area only if the Governor(s) and the existing MPO, if applicable, determine that the size and complexity of the urbanized area-make designation of more than one MPO appropriate. In those cases where two or more MPOs serve the same urbanized area, the MPOs shall establish official, written agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination, and the division of transportation planning responsibilities among the MPOs.</P>
              <P>(f) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an MPO from using the staff resources of other agencies, non-profit organizations, or contractors to carry out selected elements of the metropolitan transportation planning process.</P>
              <P>(g) An MPO designation shall remain in effect until an official redesignation has been made in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(h) An existing MPO may be redesignated only by agreement between the Governor and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).</P>
              <P>(i) For the purposes of redesignation, units of general purpose local government may be defined as elected officials from each unit of general purpose local government located within the metropolitan planning area served by the existing MPO.</P>
              <P>(j) Redesignation of an MPO (in accordance with the provisions of this section) is required whenever the existing MPO proposes to make:</P>
              <P>(1) A substantial change in the proportion of voting members on the existing MPO representing the largest incorporated city, other units of general purpose local government served by the MPO, and the State(s); or</P>
              <P>(2) A substantial change in the decisionmaking authority or responsibility of the MPO, or in decisionmaking procedures established under MPO by-laws.</P>
              <P>(k) Redesignation of an MPO serving a multistate metropolitan planning area requires agreement between the Governors of each State served by the existing MPO and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).</P>
              <P>(l) The following changes to an MPO do not require a redesignation (as long as they do not trigger a substantial change as described in paragraph (j) of this section):</P>
              <P>(1) The identification of a new urbanized area (as determined by the Bureau of the Census) within an existing metropolitan planning area;</P>
              <P>(2) Adding members to the MPO that represent new units of general purpose local government resulting from expansion of the metropolitan planning area;</P>
              <P>(3) Adding members to satisfy the specific membership requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section for an MPO that serves a TMA; or</P>

              <P>(a) The boundaries of a metropolitan planning area (MPA) shall be determined by agreement between the MPO and the Governor.</P>
              <P>(1) At a minimum, the MPA boundaries shall encompass the entire existing urbanized area (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) plus the contiguous area expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period for the metropolitan transportation plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The MPA boundaries may be further expanded to encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or combined statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget.</P>

              <P>(b) An MPO that serves an urbanized area designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) as of August 10, 2005, shall retain the MPA boundary that existed on August 10, 2005. The MPA boundaries for such MPOs may only be adjusted by agreement of the Governor and the affected MPO in accordance with the redesignation procedures described in § 450.310(h). The MPA boundary for an MPO that serves an urbanized area designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) after August 10, 2005, may be established to coincide with the designated boundaries of the ozone and/or carbon monoxide nonattainment area, in accordance with the requirements in § 450.310(b).</P>
              <P>(c) An MPA boundary may encompass more than one urbanized area.</P>
              <P>(d) MPA boundaries may be established to coincide with the geography of regional economic development and growth forecasting areas.</P>
              <P>(e) Identification of new urbanized areas within an existing metropolitan planning area by the Bureau of the Census shall not require redesignation of the existing MPO.</P>
              <P>(f) Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of the multistate area, the appropriate MPO(s), and the public transportation operator(s) are strongly encouraged to coordinate transportation planning for the entire multistate area.</P>
              <P>(g) The MPA boundaries shall not overlap with each other.</P>
              <P>(h) Where part of an urbanized area served by one MPO extends into an adjacent MPA, the MPOs shall, at a minimum, establish written agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination and the division of transportation planning responsibilities among and between the MPOs. Alternatively, the MPOs may adjust their existing boundaries so that the entire urbanized area lies within only one MPA. Boundary adjustments that change the composition of the MPO may require redesignation of one or more such MPOs.</P>
              <P>(i) The MPO (in cooperation with the State and public transportation operator(s)) shall review the MPA boundaries after each Census to determine if existing MPA boundaries meet the minimum statutory requirements for new and updated urbanized area(s), and shall adjust them as necessary. As appropriate, additional adjustments should be made to reflect the most comprehensive boundary to foster an effective planning process that ensures connectivity between modes, improves access to modal systems, and promotes efficient overall transportation investment strategies.</P>
              <P>(j) Following MPA boundary approval by the MPO and the Governor, the MPA boundary descriptions shall be provided for informational purposes to the FHWA and the FTA. The MPA boundary descriptions shall be submitted either as a geo-spatial database or described in sufficient detail to enable the boundaries to be accurately delineated on a map.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Metropolitan planning agreements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The MPO, the State(s), and the providers of public transportation shall cooperatively determine their mutual responsibilities in carrying out the metropolitan transportation planning process. These responsibilities shall be clearly identified in written agreements among the MPO, the State(s), and the providers of public transportation serving the MPA. To the extent possible, a single agreement between <PRTPAGE P="127"/>all responsible parties should be developed. The written agreement(s) shall include specific provisions for the development of financial plans that support the metropolitan transportation plan (see § 450.324) and the metropolitan TIP (see § 450.326), and development of the annual listing of obligated projects (see § 450.334).</P>
              <P>(b) The MPO, the State(s), and the providers of public transportation should periodically review and update the agreement, as appropriate, to reflect effective changes.</P>
              <P>(c) If the MPA does not include the entire nonattainment or maintenance area, there shall be a written agreement among the State department of transportation, State air quality agency, affected local agencies, and the MPO describing the process for cooperative planning and analysis of all projects outside the MPA within the nonattainment or maintenance area. The agreement must also indicate how the total transportation-related emissions for the nonattainment or maintenance area, including areas outside the MPA, will be treated for the purposes of determining conformity in accordance with the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). The agreement shall address policy mechanisms for resolving conflicts concerning transportation-related emissions that may arise between the MPA and the portion of the nonattainment or maintenance area outside the MPA.</P>
              <P>(d) In nonattainment or maintenance areas, if the MPO is not the designated agency for air quality planning under section 174 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7504), there shall be a written agreement between the MPO and the designated air quality planning agency describing their respective roles and responsibilities for air quality related transportation planning.</P>
              <P>(e) If more than one MPO has been designated to serve an urbanized area there shall be a written agreement among the MPOs, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) describing how the metropolitan transportation planning processes will be coordinated to assure the development of consistent metropolitan transportation plans and TIPs across the MPA boundaries, particularly in cases in which a proposed transportation investment extends across the boundaries of more than one MPA. If any part of the urbanized area is a nonattainment or maintenance area, the agreement also shall include State and local air quality agencies. The metropolitan transportation planning processes for affected MPOs should, to the maximum extent possible, reflect coordinated data collection, analysis, and planning assumptions across the MPAs. Alternatively, a single metropolitan transportation plan and/or TIP for the entire urbanized area may be developed jointly by the MPOs in cooperation with their respective planning partners. Coordination efforts and outcomes shall be documented in subsequent transmittals of the UPWP and other planning products, including the metropolitan transportation plan and TIP, to the State(s), the FHWA, and the FTA.</P>
              <P>(f) Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of the multistate area, the appropriate MPO(s), and the public transportation operator(s) shall coordinate transportation planning for the entire multistate area. States involved in such multistate transportation planning may:</P>
              <P>(1) Enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in support of activities authorized under this section as the activities pertain to interstate areas and localities within the States; and</P>
              <P>(2) Establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as the States may determine desirable for making the agreements and compacts effective.</P>

              <P>(g) If part of an urbanized area that has been designated as a TMA overlaps into an adjacent MPA serving an urbanized area that is not designated as a TMA, the adjacent urbanized area shall not be treated as a TMA. However, a written agreement shall be established between the MPOs with MPA boundaries, including a portion of the TMA, which clearly identifies the roles and <PRTPAGE P="128"/>responsibilities of each MPO in meeting specific TMA requirements (e.g., congestion management process, Surface Transportation Program funds suballocated to the urbanized area over 200,000 population, and project selection).</P>
              <P>(h)(1) The MPO(s), State(s), and the providers of public transportation shall jointly agree upon and develop specific written provisions for cooperatively developing and sharing information related to transportation performance data, the selection of performance targets, the reporting of performance targets, the reporting of performance to be used in tracking progress toward attainment of critical outcomes for the region of the MPO (see § 450.306(d)), and the collection of data for the State asset management plan for the NHS for each of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) When one MPO serves an urbanized area;</P>
              <P>(ii) When more than one MPO serves an urbanized area; and</P>
              <P>(iii) When an urbanized area that has been designated as a TMA overlaps into an adjacent MPA serving an urbanized area that is not a TMA.</P>
              <P>(2) These provisions shall be documented either:</P>
              <P>(i) As part of the metropolitan planning agreements required under paragraphs (a), (e), and (g) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Documented in some other means outside of the metropolitan planning agreements as determined cooperatively by the MPO(s), State(s), and providers of public transportation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Development of programmatic mitigation plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An MPO may utilize the optional framework in this section to develop programmatic mitigation plans as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process to address the potential environmental impacts of future transportation projects. The MPO, in consultation with the FHWA and/or the FTA and with the agency or agencies with jurisdiction and special expertise over the resources being addressed in the plan, will determine:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (i) An MPO may develop a programmatic mitigation plan on a local, regional, ecosystem, watershed, statewide or similar scale.</P>

              <P>(ii) The plan may encompass multiple environmental resources within a defined geographic area(s) or may focus on a specific type(s) of resource(s) such as aquatic resources, parkland, or wildlife habitat.<PRTPAGE P="131"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The plan may address or consider impacts from all projects in a defined geographic area(s) or may focus on a specific type(s) of project(s).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Contents.</E> The programmatic mitigation plan may include:</P>
              <P>(i) An assessment of the existing condition of natural and human environmental resources within the area covered by the plan, including an assessment of historic and recent trends and/or any potential threats to those resources.</P>
              <P>(ii) An identification of economic, social, and natural and human environmental resources within the geographic area that may be impacted and considered for mitigation. Examples of these resources include wetlands, streams, rivers, stormwater, parklands, cultural resources, historic resources, farmlands, archeological resources, threatened or endangered species, and critical habitat. This may include the identification of areas of high conservation concern or value and thus worthy of avoidance.</P>
              <P>(iii) An inventory of existing or planned environmental resource banks for the impacted resource categories such as wetland, stream, stormwater, habitat, species, and an inventory of federally, State, or locally approved in-lieu-of-fee programs.</P>
              <P>(iv) An assessment of potential opportunities to improve the overall quality of the identified environmental resources through strategic mitigation for impacts of transportation projects which may include the prioritization of parcels or areas for acquisition and/or potential resource banking sites.</P>
              <P>(v) An adoption or development of standard measures or operating procedures for mitigating certain types of impacts; establishment of parameters for determining or calculating appropriate mitigation for certain types of impacts, such as mitigation ratios, or criteria for determining appropriate mitigation sites.</P>
              <P>(vi) Adaptive management procedures, such as protocols or procedures that involve monitoring actual impacts against predicted impacts over time and adjusting mitigation measures in response to information gathered through the monitoring.</P>
              <P>(vii) Acknowledgement of specific statutory or regulatory requirements that must be satisfied when determining appropriate mitigation for certain types of resources.</P>
              <P>(b) A MPO may adopt a programmatic mitigation plan developed pursuant to paragraph (a), or developed pursuant to an alternative process as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section through the following process:</P>
              <P>(1) Consult with each agency with jurisdiction over the environmental resources considered in the programmatic mitigation plan;</P>
              <P>(2) Make available a draft of the programmatic mitigation plan for review and comment by appropriate environmental resource agencies and the public;</P>
              <P>(3) Consider comments received from such agencies and the public on the draft plan; and</P>
              <P>(4) Address such comments in the final programmatic mitigation plan.</P>
              <P>(c) A programmatic mitigation plan may be integrated with other plans, including watershed plans, ecosystem plans, species recovery plans, growth management plans, State Wildlife Action Plans, and land use plans.</P>

              <P>(d) If a programmatic mitigation plan has been adopted pursuant to paragraph (b), any Federal agency responsible for environmental reviews, permits, or approvals for a transportation project shall give substantial weight to the recommendations in the programmatic mitigation plan when carrying out its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (NEPA) or other Federal environmental law.</P>
              <P>(e) Nothing in this section limits the use of programmatic approaches for reviews under NEPA.</P>
              <P>(f) Nothing in this section prohibits the development, as part of or separate from the transportation planning process, of a programmatic mitigation plan independent of the framework described in paragraph (a) of this section. Further, nothing in this section prohibits the adoption of a programmatic mitigation plan in the metropolitan planning process that was developed under another authority, independent of the framework described in paragraph (a).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Congestion management process in transportation management areas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The transportation planning process in a TMA shall address congestion management through a process that provides for safe and effective integrated management and operation of the multimodal transportation system, based on a cooperatively developed and implemented metropolitan-wide strategy, of new and existing transportation facilities eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 through the use of travel demand reduction (including intercity bus operators, employer-based commuting programs such as a carpool program, vanpool program, transit benefit program, parking cash-out program, shuttle program, or telework program), job access projects, and operational management strategies.</P>
              <P>(b) The development of a congestion management process should result in multimodal system performance measures and strategies that can be reflected in the metropolitan transportation plan and the TIP.</P>
              <P>(c) The level of system performance deemed acceptable by State and local transportation officials may vary by type of transportation facility, geographic location (metropolitan area or subarea), and/or time of day. In addition, consideration should be given to strategies that manage demand, reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) travel, improve transportation system management and operations, and improve efficient service integration within and across modes, including highway, transit, passenger and freight rail operations, and non-motorized transport. Where the addition of general purpose lanes is determined to be an appropriate congestion management strategy, explicit consideration is to be given to the incorporation of appropriate features into the SOV project to facilitate future demand management strategies and operational improvements that will maintain the functional integrity and safety of those lanes.</P>
              <P>(d) The congestion management process shall be developed, established, and implemented as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process that includes coordination with transportation system management and operations activities. The congestion management process shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) Methods to monitor and evaluate the performance of the multimodal transportation system, identify the underlying causes of recurring and non-recurring congestion, identify and evaluate alternative strategies, provide information supporting the implementation of actions, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented actions;</P>
              <P>(2) Definition of congestion management objectives and appropriate performance measures to assess the extent of congestion and support the evaluation of the effectiveness of congestion reduction and mobility enhancement strategies for the movement of people and goods. Since levels of acceptable system performance may vary among local communities, performance measures should be tailored to the specific needs of the area and established cooperatively by the State(s), affected MPO(s), and local officials in consultation with the operators of major modes of transportation in the coverage area, including providers of public transportation;</P>
              <P>(3) Establishment of a coordinated program for data collection and system performance monitoring to define the extent and duration of congestion, to contribute in determining the causes of congestion, and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of implemented actions. To the extent possible, this data collection program should be coordinated with existing data sources (including archived operational/ITS data) and coordinated with operations managers in the metropolitan area;</P>
              <P>(4) Identification and evaluation of the anticipated performance and expected benefits of appropriate congestion management strategies that will contribute to the more effective use and improved safety of existing and future transportation systems based on the established performance measures. The following categories of strategies, or combinations of strategies, are some examples of what should be appropriately considered for each area:</P>

              <P>(i) Demand management measures, including growth management, and congestion pricing;<PRTPAGE P="133"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Traffic operational improvements;</P>
              <P>(iii) Public transportation improvements;</P>
              <P>(iv) ITS technologies as related to the regional ITS architecture; and</P>
              <P>(v) Where necessary, additional system capacity.</P>
              <P>(5) Identification of an implementation schedule, implementation responsibilities, and possible funding sources for each strategy (or combination of strategies) proposed for implementation; and</P>
              <P>(6) Implementation of a process for periodic assessment of the effectiveness of implemented strategies, in terms of the area's established performance measures. The results of this evaluation shall be provided to decision makers and the public to provide guidance on selection of effective strategies for future implementation.</P>

              <P>(e) In a TMA designated as nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Federal funds may not be programmed for any project that will result in a significant increase in the carrying capacity for SOVs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a new general purpose highway on a new location or adding general purpose lanes, with the exception of safety improvements or the elimination of bottlenecks), unless the project is addressed through a congestion management process meeting the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) In TMAs designated as nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide, the congestion management process shall provide an appropriate analysis of reasonable (including multimodal) travel demand reduction and operational management strategies for the corridor in which a project that will result in a significant increase in capacity for SOVs (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) is proposed to be advanced with Federal funds. If the analysis demonstrates that travel demand reduction and operational management strategies cannot fully satisfy the need for additional capacity in the corridor and additional SOV capacity is warranted, then the congestion management process shall identify all reasonable strategies to manage the SOV facility safely and effectively (or to facilitate its management in the future). Other travel demand reduction and operational management strategies appropriate for the corridor, but not appropriate for incorporation into the SOV facility itself, shall also be identified through the congestion management process. All identified reasonable travel demand reduction and operational management strategies shall be incorporated into the SOV project or committed to by the State and MPO for implementation.</P>
              <P>(g) State laws, rules, or regulations pertaining to congestion management systems or programs may constitute the congestion management process, if the FHWA and the FTA find that the State laws, rules, or regulations are consistent with, and fulfill the intent of, the purposes of 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Congestion management plan.</E> A MPO serving a TMA may develop a plan that includes projects and strategies that will be considered in the TIP of such MPO.</P>
              <P>(1) Such plan shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Develop regional goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled during peak commuting hours and improve transportation connections between areas with high job concentration and areas with high concentrations of low-income households;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify existing public transportation services, employer based commuter programs, and other existing transportation services that support access to jobs in the region; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Identify proposed projects and programs to reduce congestion and increase job access opportunities.</P>
              <P>(2) In developing the congestion management plan, an MPO shall consult with employers, private and nonprofit providers of public transportation, transportation management organizations, and organizations that provide job access reverse commute projects or job-related services to low-income individuals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Development and content of the metropolitan transportation plan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The metropolitan transportation planning process shall include the development of a transportation plan addressing no less than a 20-year planning horizon as of the effective date. In formulating the transportation plan, the MPO shall consider factors described in § 450.306 as the factors relate to a minimum 20-year forecast period. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the effective date of the transportation plan shall be the date of a conformity determination issued by the FHWA and the FTA. In attainment areas, the effective date of the transportation plan shall be its date of adoption by the MPO.</P>
              <P>(b) The transportation plan shall include both long-range and short-range strategies/actions that provide for the development of an integrated multimodal transportation system (including accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities) to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in addressing current and future transportation demand.</P>
              <P>(c) The MPO shall review and update the transportation plan at least every 4 years in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas and at least every 5 years in attainment areas to confirm the transportation plan's validity and consistency with current and forecasted transportation and land use conditions and trends and to extend the forecast period to at least a 20-year planning horizon. In addition, the MPO may revise the transportation plan at any time using the procedures in this section without a requirement to extend the horizon year. The MPO shall approve the transportation plan (and any revisions) and submit it for information purposes to the Governor. Copies of any updated or revised transportation plans must be provided to the FHWA and the FTA.</P>
              <P>(d) In metropolitan areas that are in nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide, the MPO shall coordinate the development of the metropolitan transportation plan with the process for developing transportation control measures (TCMs) in a State Implementation Plan (SIP).</P>
              <P>(e) The MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) shall validate data used in preparing other existing modal plans for providing input to the transportation plan. In updating the transportation plan, the MPO shall base the update on the latest available estimates and assumptions for population, land use, travel, employment, congestion, and economic activity. The MPO shall approve transportation plan contents and supporting analyses produced by a transportation plan update.</P>
              <P>(f) The metropolitan transportation plan shall, at a minimum, include:</P>
              <P>(1) The current and projected transportation demand of persons and goods in the metropolitan planning area over the period of the transportation plan;</P>
              <P>(2) Existing and proposed transportation facilities (including major roadways, public transportation facilities, intercity bus facilities, multimodal and intermodal facilities, nonmotorized transportation facilities (e.g., pedestrian walkways and bicycle facilities), and intermodal connectors) that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving emphasis to those facilities that serve important national and regional transportation functions over the period of the transportation plan.</P>
              <P>(3) A description of the performance measures and performance targets used in assessing the performance of the transportation system in accordance with § 450.306(d).</P>
              <P>(4) A system performance report and subsequent updates evaluating the condition and performance of the transportation system with respect to the performance targets described in § 450.306(d), including—</P>
              <P>(i) Progress achieved by the metropolitan planning organization in meeting the performance targets in comparison with system performance recorded in previous reports, including baseline data; and</P>

              <P>(ii) For metropolitan planning organizations that voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios, an analysis of how the preferred scenario has improved the conditions and performance of the transportation system and how <PRTPAGE P="135"/>changes in local policies and investments have impacted the costs necessary to achieve the identified performance targets.</P>
              <P>(5) Operational and management strategies to improve the performance of existing transportation facilities to relieve vehicular congestion and maximize the safety and mobility of people and goods;</P>
              <P>(6) Consideration of the results of the congestion management process in TMAs that meet the requirements of this subpart, including the identification of SOV projects that result from a congestion management process in TMAs that are nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide.</P>
              <P>(7) Assessment of capital investment and other strategies to preserve the existing and projected future metropolitan transportation infrastructure, provide for multimodal capacity increases based on regional priorities and needs, and reduce the vulnerability of the existing transportation infrastructure to natural disasters. The metropolitan transportation plan may consider projects and strategies that address areas or corridors where current or projected congestion threatens the efficient functioning of key elements of the metropolitan area's transportation system.</P>
              <P>(8) Transportation and transit enhancement activities, including consideration of the role that intercity buses may play in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption in a cost-effective manner and strategies and investments that preserve and enhance intercity bus systems, including systems that are privately owned and operated, and including transportation alternatives, as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a), and associated transit improvements, as described in 49 U.S.C. 5302(a), as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(9) Design concept and design scope descriptions of all existing and proposed transportation facilities in sufficient detail, regardless of funding source, in nonattainment and maintenance areas for conformity determinations under the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). In all areas (regardless of air quality designation), all proposed improvements shall be described in sufficient detail to develop cost estimates;</P>
              <P>(10) A discussion of types of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the metropolitan transportation plan. The discussion may focus on policies, programs, or strategies, rather than at the project level. The MPO shall develop the discussion in consultation with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies. The MPO may establish reasonable timeframes for performing this consultation;</P>
              <P>(11) A financial plan that demonstrates how the adopted transportation plan can be implemented.</P>
              <P>(i) For purposes of transportation system operations and maintenance, the financial plan shall contain system-level estimates of costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available to adequately operate and maintain the Federal-aid highways (as defined by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(5)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53).</P>
              <P>(ii) For the purpose of developing the metropolitan transportation plan, the MPO(s), public transportation operator(s), and State shall cooperatively develop estimates of funds that will be available to support metropolitan transportation plan implementation, as required under § 450.314(a). All necessary financial resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the transportation plan shall be identified.</P>

              <P>(iii) The financial plan shall include recommendations on any additional financing strategies to fund projects and programs included in the metropolitan transportation plan. In the case of new funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified. The financial plan may include an assessment of the appropriateness of innovative finance techniques (for example, tolling, pricing, bonding, public private partnerships, or other strategies) as revenue sources for projects in the plan.<PRTPAGE P="136"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) In developing the financial plan, the MPO shall take into account all projects and strategies proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C., title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 or with other Federal funds; State assistance; local sources; and private participation. Revenue and cost estimates that support the metropolitan transportation plan must use an inflation rate(s) to reflect “year of expenditure dollars,” based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed cooperatively by the MPO, State(s), and public transportation operator(s).</P>

              <P>(v) For the outer years of the metropolitan transportation plan (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> beyond the first 10 years), the financial plan may reflect aggregate cost ranges/cost bands, as long as the future funding source(s) is reasonably expected to be available to support the projected cost ranges/cost bands.</P>
              <P>(vi) For nonattainment and maintenance areas, the financial plan shall address the specific financial strategies required to ensure the implementation of TCMs in the applicable SIP.</P>
              <P>(vii) For illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that would be included in the adopted transportation plan if additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available.</P>

              <P>(viii) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a metropolitan transportation plan to be fiscally constrained and a revenue source is subsequently removed or substantially reduced (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by legislative or administrative actions), the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of fiscal constraint; however, in such cases, the FHWA and the FTA will not act on an updated or amended metropolitan transportation plan that does not reflect the changed revenue situation.</P>
              <P>(12) Pedestrian walkway and bicycle transportation facilities in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 217(g).</P>
              <P>(g) The MPO shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation concerning the development of the transportation plan. The consultation shall involve, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) Comparison of transportation plans with State conservation plans or maps, if available; or</P>
              <P>(2) Comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.</P>
              <P>(h) The metropolitan transportation plan should integrate the priorities, goals, countermeasures, strategies, or projects for the metropolitan planning area contained in the HSIP, including the SHSP required under 23 U.S.C. 148, the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan required under 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), or an Interim Agency Safety Plan in accordance with 49 CFR part 659, as in effect until completion of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, and may incorporate or reference applicable emergency relief and disaster preparedness plans and strategies and policies that support homeland security, as appropriate, to safeguard the personal security of all motorized and non-motorized users.</P>
              <P>(i) An MPO may, while fitting the needs and complexity of its community, voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios for consideration as part of the development of the metropolitan transportation plan.</P>
              <P>(1) An MPO that chooses to develop multiple scenarios under this paragraph (i) is encouraged to consider:</P>
              <P>(i) Potential regional investment strategies for the planning horizon;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assumed distribution of population and employment;</P>
              <P>(iii) A scenario that, to the maximum extent practicable, maintains baseline conditions for the performance areas identified in § 450.306(d) and measures established under 23 CFR part 490;</P>
              <P>(iv) A scenario that improves the baseline conditions for as many of the performance measures identified in § 450.306(d) as possible;</P>
              <P>(v) Revenue constrained scenarios based on the total revenues expected to be available over the forecast period of the plan; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Estimated costs and potential revenues available to support each scenario.</P>

              <P>(2) In addition to the performance areas identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(c), 49 U.S.C. 5326(c), and 5329(d), and the <PRTPAGE P="137"/>measures established under 23 CFR part 490, MPOs may evaluate scenarios developed under this paragraph using locally developed measures.</P>
              <P>(j) The MPO shall provide individuals, affected public agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, public ports, freight shippers, providers of freight transportation services, private providers of transportation (including intercity bus operators, employer-based commuting programs, such as carpool program, vanpool program, transit benefit program, parking cashout program, shuttle program, or telework program), representatives of users of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, and other interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the transportation plan using the participation plan developed under § 450.316(a).</P>
              <P>(k) The MPO shall publish or otherwise make readily available the metropolitan transportation plan for public review, including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web.</P>
              <P>(l) A State or MPO is not required to select any project from the illustrative list of additional projects included in the financial plan under paragraph (f)(11) of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) In nonattainment and maintenance areas for transportation-related pollutants, the MPO, as well as the FHWA and the FTA, must make a conformity determination on any updated or amended transportation plan in accordance with the Clean Air Act and the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). A 12-month conformity lapse grace period will be implemented when an area misses an applicable deadline, in accordance with the Clean Air Act and the transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). At the end of this 12-month grace period, the existing conformity determination will lapse. During a conformity lapse, MPOs can prepare an interim metropolitan transportation plan as a basis for advancing projects that are eligible to proceed under a conformity lapse. An interim metropolitan transportation plan consisting of eligible projects from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan and TIP may proceed immediately without revisiting the requirements of this section, subject to interagency consultation defined in 40 CFR part 93, subpart A. An interim metropolitan transportation plan containing eligible projects that are not from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan and TIP must meet all the requirements of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) The MPO, in cooperation with the State(s) and any affected public transportation operator(s), shall develop a TIP for the metropolitan planning area. The TIP shall reflect the investment priorities established in the current metropolitan transportation plan and shall cover a period of no less than 4 years, be updated at least every 4 years, and be approved by the MPO and the Governor. However, if the TIP covers more than 4 years, the FHWA and the FTA will consider the projects in the additional years as informational. The MPO may update the TIP more frequently, but the cycle for updating the TIP must be compatible with the STIP development and approval process. The TIP expires when the FHWA/FTA approval of the STIP expires. Copies of any updated or revised TIPs must be provided to the FHWA and the FTA. In nonattainment and maintenance areas subject to transportation conformity requirements, the FHWA and the FTA, as well as the MPO, must make a conformity determination on any updated or amended TIP, in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements and the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A).</P>

              <P>(b) The MPO shall provide all interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed TIP as required by § 450.316(a). In addition, in nonattainment area TMAs, the <PRTPAGE P="138"/>MPO shall provide at least one formal public meeting during the TIP development process, which should be addressed through the participation plan described in § 450.316(a). In addition, the MPO shall publish or otherwise make readily available the TIP for public review, including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web, as described in § 450.316(a).</P>
              <P>(c) The TIP shall be designed such that once implemented, it makes progress toward achieving the performance targets established under § 450.306(d).</P>
              <P>(d) The TIP shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, a description of the anticipated effect of the TIP toward achieving the performance targets identified in the metropolitan transportation plan, linking investment priorities to those performance targets.</P>
              <P>(e) The TIP shall include capital and non-capital surface transportation projects (or phases of projects) within the boundaries of the metropolitan planning area proposed for funding under 23 U.S.C. and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (including transportation alternatives; associated transit improvements; Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects; HSIP projects; trails projects; accessible pedestrian walkways; and bicycle facilities), except the following that may be included:</P>
              <P>(1) Safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 402 and 49 U.S.C. 31102;</P>
              <P>(2) Metropolitan planning projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(d), and 49 U.S.C. 5305(d);</P>
              <P>(3) State planning and research projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 505 and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e);</P>
              <P>(4) At the discretion of the State and MPO, metropolitan planning projects funded with Surface Transportation Program funds;</P>
              <P>(5) Emergency relief projects (except those involving substantial functional, locational, or capacity changes);</P>
              <P>(6) National planning and research projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5314; and</P>
              <P>(7) Project management oversight projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5327.</P>
              <P>(f) The TIP shall contain all regionally significant projects requiring an action by the FHWA or the FTA whether or not the projects are to be funded under title 23 U.S.C. Chapters 1 and 2 or title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (e.g., addition of an interchange to the Interstate System with State, local, and/or private funds and congressionally designated projects not funded under 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). For public information and conformity purposes, the TIP shall include all regionally significant projects proposed to be funded with Federal funds other than those administered by the FHWA or the FTA, as well as all regionally significant projects to be funded with non-Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(g) The TIP shall include, for each project or phase (e.g., preliminary engineering, environment/NEPA, right-of-way, design, or construction), the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Sufficient descriptive material (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> type of work, termini, and length) to identify the project or phase;</P>
              <P>(2) Estimated total project cost, which may extend beyond the 4 years of the TIP;</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of Federal funds proposed to be obligated during each program year for the project or phase (for the first year, this includes the proposed category of Federal funds and source(s) of non-Federal funds. For the second, third, and fourth years, this includes the likely category or possible categories of Federal funds and sources of non-Federal funds);</P>
              <P>(4) Identification of the agencies responsible for carrying out the project or phase;</P>
              <P>(5) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, identification of those projects that are identified as TCMs in the applicable SIP;</P>
              <P>(6) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, included projects shall be specified in sufficient detail (design concept and scope) for air quality analysis in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A); and</P>

              <P>(7) In areas with Americans with Disabilities Act required paratransit and key station plans, identification of <PRTPAGE P="139"/>those projects that will implement these plans.</P>
              <P>(h) Projects that are not considered to be of appropriate scale for individual identification in a given program year may be grouped by function, work type, and/or geographic area using the applicable classifications under 23 CFR 771.117(c) and (d) and/or 40 CFR part 93. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, project classifications must be consistent with the “exempt project” classifications contained in the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). In addition, projects proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. Chapter 2 that are not regionally significant may be grouped in one line item or identified individually in the TIP.</P>
              <P>(i) Each project or project phase included in the TIP shall be consistent with the approved metropolitan transportation plan.</P>
              <P>(j) The TIP shall include a financial plan that demonstrates how the approved TIP can be implemented, indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the TIP, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In developing the TIP, the MPO, State(s), and public transportation operator(s) shall cooperatively develop estimates of funds that are reasonably expected to be available to support TIP implementation in accordance with § 450.314(a). Only projects for which construction or operating funds can reasonably be expected to be available may be included. In the case of new funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified. In developing the financial plan, the MPO shall take into account all projects and strategies funded under title 23 U.S.C., title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, and other Federal funds; and regionally significant projects that are not federally funded. For purposes of transportation operations and maintenance, the financial plan shall contain system-level estimates of costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available to adequately operate and maintain Federal-aid highways (as defined by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(6)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). In addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that would be included in the TIP if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available. Revenue and cost estimates for the TIP must use an inflation rate(s) to reflect “year of expenditure dollars,” based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed cooperatively by the MPO, State(s), and public transportation operator(s).</P>
              <P>(k) The TIP shall include a project, or a phase of a project, only if full funding can reasonably be anticipated to be available for the project within the time period contemplated for completion of the project. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, projects included in the first 2 years of the TIP shall be limited to those for which funds are available or committed. For the TIP, financial constraint shall be demonstrated and maintained by year and shall include sufficient financial information to demonstrate which projects are to be implemented using current and/or reasonably available revenues, while federally supported facilities are being adequately operated and maintained. In the case of proposed funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified in the financial plan consistent with paragraph (h) of this section. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the TIP shall give priority to eligible TCMs identified in the approved SIP in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A) and shall provide for their timely implementation.</P>

              <P>(l) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a TIP to be fiscally constrained and a revenue source is subsequently removed or substantially reduced (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by legislative or administrative actions), the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of fiscal constraint. However, in such cases, the FHWA and the FTA will not act on an updated or amended TIP that does not reflect the changed revenue situation.</P>

              <P>(m) Procedures or agreements that distribute suballocated Surface Transportation Program funds to individual <PRTPAGE P="140"/>jurisdictions or modes within the MPA by pre-determined percentages or formulas are inconsistent with the legislative provisions that require the MPO, in cooperation with the State and the public transportation operator, to develop a prioritized and financially constrained TIP and shall not be used unless they can be clearly shown to be based on considerations required to be addressed as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process.</P>
              <P>(n) As a management tool for monitoring progress in implementing the transportation plan, the TIP should:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify the criteria and process for prioritizing implementation of transportation plan elements (including multimodal trade-offs) for inclusion in the TIP and any changes in priorities from previous TIPs;</P>
              <P>(2) List major projects from the previous TIP that were implemented and identify any significant delays in the planned implementation of major projects; and</P>
              <P>(3) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, describe the progress in implementing any required TCMs, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93.</P>
              <P>(o) In metropolitan nonattainment and maintenance areas, a 12-month conformity lapse grace period will be implemented when an area misses an applicable deadline, according to the Clean Air Act and the transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). At the end of this 12-month grace period, the existing conformity determination will lapse. During a conformity lapse, MPOs may prepare an interim TIP as a basis for advancing projects that are eligible to proceed under a conformity lapse. An interim TIP consisting of eligible projects from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming metropolitan transportation plan and TIP may proceed immediately without revisiting the requirements of this section, subject to interagency consultation defined in 40 CFR part 93. An interim TIP containing eligible projects that are not from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan and TIP must meet all the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(p) Projects in any of the first 4 years of the TIP may be advanced in place of another project in the first 4 years of the TIP, subject to the project selection requirements of § 450.332. In addition, the MPO may revise the TIP at any time under procedures agreed to by the State, MPO, and public transportation operator(s) consistent with the TIP development procedures established in this section, as well as the procedures for the MPO participation plan (see § 450.316(a)) and FHWA/FTA actions on the TIP (see § 450.330).</P>

In nonattainment or maintenance areas for transportation-related pollutants, if a TIP amendment involves non-exempt projects (per 40 CFR part 93), or is replaced with an updated TIP, the MPO and the FHWA and the FTA must make a new conformity determination. In all areas, changes that affect fiscal constraint must take place by amendment of the TIP. The MPO shall use public participation procedures consistent with § 450.316(a) in revising the TIP, except that these procedures are not required for administrative modifications.</P>
              <P>(b) After approval by the MPO and the Governor, the State shall include the TIP without change, directly or by reference, in the STIP required under 23 U.S.C. 135.

              <SUBJECT>TIP action by the FHWA and the FTA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The FHWA and the FTA shall jointly find that each metropolitan TIP is consistent with the metropolitan transportation plan produced by the continuing and comprehensive transportation process carried on cooperatively by the MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303. This finding shall be based on the self-certification statement submitted by the State and MPO under § 450.336, a review of the metropolitan transportation plan by the FHWA and the FTA, and upon other reviews as deemed necessary by the FHWA and the FTA.</P>
              <P>(b) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the MPO, as well as the FHWA and the FTA, shall determine conformity of any updated or amended TIP, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93. After the FHWA and the FTA issue a conformity determination on the TIP, the TIP shall be incorporated, without change, into the STIP, directly or by reference.</P>
              <P>(c) If an MPO has not updated the metropolitan transportation plan in accordance with the cycles defined in § 450.324(c), projects may only be advanced from a TIP that was approved and found to conform (in nonattainment and maintenance areas) prior to expiration of the metropolitan transportation plan and meets the TIP update requirements of § 450.326(a). Until the MPO approves (in attainment areas) or the FHWA and the FTA issue a conformity determination on (in nonattainment and maintenance areas) the updated metropolitan transportation plan, the MPO may not amend the TIP.</P>
              <P>(d) In the case of extenuating circumstances, the FHWA and the FTA will consider and take appropriate action on requests to extend the STIP approval period for all or part of the TIP in accordance with § 450.220(b).</P>
              <P>(e) If an illustrative project is included in the TIP, no Federal action may be taken on that project by the FHWA and the FTA until it is formally included in the financially constrained and conforming metropolitan transportation plan and TIP.</P>
              <P>(f) Where necessary in order to maintain or establish operations, the FHWA and the FTA may approve highway and transit operating assistance for specific projects or programs, even though the projects or programs may not be included in an approved TIP.</P>

              <P>(a) Once a TIP that meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134(j), 49 U.S.C. 5303(j), and § 450.326 has been developed and approved, the first year of the TIP will constitute an “agreed to” list of projects for project selection purposes and no further project selection action is required for the implementing agency to proceed with projects, except where the appropriated Federal funds available to the metropolitan planning area are significantly less than the authorized amounts or where there are significant shifting of projects between years. In this case, the MPO, the State, and the public transportation operator(s) if requested by the MPO, the State, or the public transportation operator(s) shall jointly develop a revised “agreed to” list of projects. If the State or public transportation operator(s) wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or fourth year of the TIP, the specific project selection procedures stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be used unless the MPO, the State, and the public transportation operator(s) jointly develop expedited project selection procedures to provide for the advancement of projects from the second, third, or fourth years of the TIP.</P>

              <P>(b) In metropolitan areas not designated as TMAs, the State and/or the public transportation operator(s), in cooperation with the MPO shall select projects to be implemented using title 23 U.S.C. funds (other than Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects) or funds under title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, from the approved metropolitan TIP. Tribal Transportation <PRTPAGE P="142"/>Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects shall be selected in accordance with procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201, 202, 203, and 204.</P>
              <P>(c) In areas designated as TMAs, the MPO shall select all 23 U.S.C. and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 funded projects (excluding projects on the NHS and Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program) in consultation with the State and public transportation operator(s) from the approved TIP and in accordance with the priorities in the approved TIP. The State shall select projects on the NHS in cooperation with the MPO, from the approved TIP. Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects shall be selected in accordance with procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201, 202, 203, and 204.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in § 450.326(e) and § 450.330(f), projects not included in the federally approved STIP are not eligible for funding with funds under title 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53.</P>
              <P>(e) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, priority shall be given to the timely implementation of TCMs contained in the applicable SIP in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 450—Linking the Transportation Planning and NEPA Processes</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Overview</HD>
              <P>This Appendix provides additional information to explain the linkage between the transportation planning and project development/National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) processes. It is intended to be non-binding and should not be construed as a rule of general applicability.</P>
              <P>For 40 years, the Congress has directed that federally funded highway and transit projects must flow from metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes (pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 134-135 and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5306). Over the years, the Congress has refined and strengthened the transportation planning process as the foundation for project decisions, emphasizing public involvement, consideration of environmental and other factors, and a Federal role that oversees the transportation planning process but does not second-guess the content of transportation plans and programs.</P>

              <P>Despite this statutory emphasis on transportation planning, the environmental analyses produced to meet the requirements of the NEPA of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4231 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) have often been conducted de novo, disconnected from the analyses used to develop long-range transportation plans, statewide and metropolitan Transportation Improvement Programs (STIPs/TIPs), or planning-level corridor/subarea/feasibility studies. When the NEPA and transportation planning processes are not well coordinated, the NEPA process may lead to the development of information that is more appropriately developed in the planning process, resulting in duplication of work and delays in transportation improvements.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this Appendix is to change this culture, by supporting congressional intent that statewide and metropolitan transportation planning should be the foundation for highway and transit project decisions. This Appendix was crafted to recognize that transportation planning processes vary across the country. This document provides details on how information, analysis, and products from transportation planning can be incorporated into and relied upon in NEPA documents under existing laws, regardless of when the Notice of Intent has <PRTPAGE P="145"/>been published. This Appendix presents environmental review as a continuum of sequential study, refinement, and expansion performed in transportation planning and during project development/NEPA, with information developed and conclusions drawn in early stages utilized in subsequent (and more detailed) review stages.</P>
              <P>The information below is intended for use by State departments of transportation (State DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and public transportation operators to clarify the circumstances under which transportation planning level choices and analyses can be adopted or incorporated into the process required by NEPA. Additionally, the FHWA and the FTA will work with Federal environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies to incorporate the principles of this Appendix in their day-to-day NEPA policies and procedures related to their involvement in highway and transit projects.</P>
              <P>This Appendix does not extend NEPA requirements to transportation plans and programs. The Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) specifically exempted transportation plans and programs from NEPA review. Therefore, initiating the NEPA process as part of, or concurrently with, a transportation planning study does not subject transportation plans and programs to NEPA.</P>
              <P>Implementation of this Appendix by States, MPOs, and public transportation operators is voluntary. The degree to which studies, analyses, or conclusions from the transportation planning process can be incorporated into the project development/NEPA processes will depend upon how well they meet certain standards established by NEPA regulations and guidance. While some transportation planning processes already meet these standards, others will need some modification.</P>
              <P>The remainder of this Appendix document utilizes a “Question and Answer” format, organized into three primary categories (“Procedural Issues,” “Substantive Issues,” and “Administrative Issues”).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Procedural Issues</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. In what format should the transportation planning information be included?</HD>
              <P>To be included in the NEPA process, work from the transportation planning process must be documented in a form that can be appended to the NEPA document or incorporated by reference. Documents may be incorporated by reference if they are readily available so as to not impede agency or public review of the action. Any document incorporated by reference must be “reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment.” Incorporated materials must be cited in the NEPA document and their contents briefly described, so that the reader understands why the document is cited and knows where to look for further information. To the extent possible, the documentation should be in a form such as official actions by the MPO, State DOT, or public transportation operator and/or correspondence within and among the organizations involved in the transportation planning process.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. What is a reasonable level of detail for a planning product that is intended to be used in a NEPA document? How does this level of detail compare to what is considered a full NEPA analysis?</HD>
              <P>For purposes of transportation planning alone, a planning-level analysis does not need to rise to the level of detail required in the NEPA process. Rather, it needs to be accurate and up-to-date, and should adequately support recommended improvements in the statewide or metropolitan long-range transportation plan. The SAFETEA-LU requires transportation planning processes to focus on setting a context and following acceptable procedures. For example, the SAFETEA-LU requires a “discussion of the types of potential environmental mitigation activities” and potential areas for their implementation, rather than details on specific strategies. The SAFETEA-LU also emphasizes consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies.</P>

              <P>However, the Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) ultimately will be judged by the standards applicable under the NEPA regulations and guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). To the extent the information incorporated from the transportation planning process, standing alone, does not contain all of the information or analysis required by NEPA, then it will need to be supplemented by other information contained in the EIS or EA that would, in conjunction with the information from the plan, collectively meet the requirements of NEPA. The intent is not to require NEPA studies in the transportation planning process. As an option, the NEPA analyses prepared for project development can be integrated with transportation planning studies (see the response to Question 9 for additional information).<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. What type and extent of involvement from Federal, Tribal, State, and local environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies is needed in the transportation planning process in order for planning-level decisions to be more readily accepted in the NEPA process?</HD>
              <P>Sections 3005, 3006, and 6001 of the SAFETEA-LU established formal consultation requirements for MPOs and State DOTs to employ with environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies in the development of long-range transportation plans. For example, metropolitan transportation plans now “shall include a discussion of the types of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the [transportation] plan,” and that these planning-level discussions “shall be developed in consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies.” In addition, MPOs “shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation concerning the development of a long-range transportation plan,” and that this consultation “shall involve, as appropriate, comparison of transportation plans with State conservation plans or maps, if available, or comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.” Similar SAFETEA-LU language addresses the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan, with the addition of Tribal conservation plans or maps to this planning-level “comparison.”</P>

              <P>In addition, section 6002 of the SAFETEA-LU established several mechanisms for increased efficiency in environmental reviews for project decision-making. For example, the term “lead agency” collectively means the U.S. Department of Transportation and a State or local governmental entity serving as a joint lead agency for the NEPA process. In addition, the lead agency is responsible for inviting and designating “participating agencies” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> other Federal or non-Federal agencies that may have an interest in the proposed project). Any Federal agency that is invited by the lead agency to participate in the environmental review process for a project shall be designated as a participating agency by the lead agency unless the invited agency informs the lead agency, in writing, by the deadline specified in the invitation that the invited agency:</P>
              <P>(a) Has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project; (b) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and (c) does not intend to submit comments on the project.</P>
              <P>Past successful examples of using transportation planning products in NEPA analysis are based on early and continuous involvement of environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies. Without this early coordination, environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies are more likely to expect decisions made or analyses conducted in the transportation planning process to be revisited during the NEPA process. Early participation in transportation planning provides environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies better insight into the needs and objectives of the locality. Additionally, early participation provides an important opportunity for environmental, regulatory, and resource agency concerns to be identified and addressed early in the process, such as those related to permit applications. Moreover, Federal, Tribal, State, and local environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies are able to share data on particular resources, which can play a critical role in determining the feasibility of a transportation solution with respect to environmental impacts. The use of other agency planning outputs can result in a transportation project that could support multiple goals (transportation, environmental, and community). Further, planning decisions by these other agencies may have impacts on long-range transportation plans and/or the STIP/TIP, thereby providing important input to the transportation planning process and advancing integrated decision-making.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. What is the procedure for using decisions or analyses from the transportation planning process?</HD>

              <P>The lead agencies jointly decide, and must agree, on what processes and consultation techniques are used to determine the transportation planning products that will be incorporated into the NEPA process. At a minimum, a robust scoping/early coordination process (which explains to Federal and State environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies and the public the information and/or analyses utilized to develop the planning products, how the purpose and need was developed and refined, and how the design concept and scope were determined) should play a critical role in leading to informed decisions by the lead agencies on the suitability of the transportation planning information, analyses, documents, and decisions for use in the NEPA process. As part of a rigorous scoping/early coordination process, the FHWA and the FTA should ensure that the transportation planning results are appropriately documented, shared, and used.<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. To what extent can the FHWA/FTA provide up-front assurance that decisions and additional investments made in the transportation planning process will allow planning-level decisions and analyses to be used in the NEPA process?</HD>
              <P>There are no guarantees. However, the potential is greatly improved for transportation planning processes that address the “3-C” planning principles (comprehensive, cooperative, and continuous); incorporate the intent of NEPA through the consideration of natural, physical, and social effects; involve environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies; thoroughly document the transportation planning process information, analysis, and decision; and vet the planning results through the applicable public involvement processes.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. What considerations will the FHWA/FTA take into account in their review of transportation planning products for acceptance in project development/NEPA?</HD>
              <P>The FHWA and the FTA will give deference to decisions resulting from the transportation planning process if the FHWA and FTA determine that the planning process is consistent with the “3-C” planning principles and when the planning study process, alternatives considered, and resulting decisions have a rational basis that is thoroughly documented and vetted through the applicable public involvement processes. Moreover, any applicable program-specific requirements (e.g., those of the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program or the FTA's Capital Investment Grant program) also must be met.</P>
              <P>The NEPA requires that the FHWA and the FTA be able to stand behind the overall soundness and credibility of analyses conducted and decisions made during the transportation planning process if they are incorporated into a NEPA document. For example, if systems-level or other broad objectives or choices from the transportation plan are incorporated into the purpose and need statement for a NEPA document, the FHWA and the FTA should not revisit whether these are the best objectives or choices among other options. Rather, the FHWA and the FTA review would include making sure that objectives or choices derived from the transportation plan were: Based on transportation planning factors established by Federal law; reflect a credible and articulated planning rationale; founded on reliable data; and developed through transportation planning processes meeting FHWA and FTA statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition, the basis for the goals and choices must be documented and included in the NEPA document. The FHWA/FTA reviewers do not need to review whether assumptions or analytical methods used in the studies are the best available, but, instead, need to assure that such assumptions or analytical methods are reasonable, scientifically acceptable, and consistent with goals, objectives, and policies set forth in long-range transportation plans. This review would include determining whether: (a) Assumptions have a rational basis and are up-to-date and (b) data, analytical methods, and modeling techniques are reliable, defensible, reasonably current, and meet data quality requirements.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Substantive Issues</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">General Issues To Be Considered</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. What should be considered in order to rely upon transportation planning studies in NEPA?</HD>
              <P>The following questions should be answered prior to accepting studies conducted during the transportation planning process for use in NEPA. While not a “checklist,” these questions are intended to guide the practitioner's analysis of the planning products:</P>
              <P>• How much time has passed since the planning studies and corresponding decisions were made?</P>
              <P>• Were the future year policy assumptions used in the transportation planning process related to land use, economic development, transportation costs, and network expansion consistent with those to be used in the NEPA process?</P>
              <P>• Is the information still relevant/valid?</P>
              <P>• What changes have occurred in the area since the study was completed?</P>
              <P>• Is the information in a format that can be appended to an environmental document or reformatted to do so?</P>
              <P>• Are the analyses in a planning-level report or document based on data, analytical methods, and modeling techniques that are reliable, defensible, and consistent with those used in other regional transportation studies and project development activities?</P>
              <P>• Were the FHWA and FTA, other agencies, and the public involved in the relevant planning analysis and the corresponding planning decisions?</P>
              <P>• Were the planning products available to other agencies and the public during NEPA scoping?</P>
              <P>• During NEPA scoping, was a clear connection between the decisions made in planning and those to be made during the project development stage explained to the public and others? What was the response?</P>

              <P>• Are natural resource and land use plans being informed by transportation planning products, and vice versa?<PRTPAGE P="148"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Purpose and Need</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. How can transportation planning be used to shape a project's purpose and need in the NEPA process?</HD>
              <P>A sound transportation planning process is the primary source of the project purpose and need. Through transportation planning, State and local governments, with involvement of stakeholders and the public, establish a vision for the region's future transportation system, define transportation goals and objectives for realizing that vision, decide which needs to address, and determine the timeframe for addressing these issues. The transportation planning process also provides a potential forum to define a project's purpose and need by framing the scope of the problem to be addressed by a proposed project. This scope may be further refined during the transportation planning process as more information about the transportation need is collected and consultation with the public and other stakeholders clarifies other issues and goals for the region.</P>
              <P>23 U.S.C. 139(f), as amended by the SAFETEA-LU Section 6002, provides additional focus regarding the definition of the purpose and need and objectives. For example, the lead agency, as early as practicable during the environmental review process, shall provide an opportunity for involvement by participating agencies and the public in defining the purpose and need for a project. The statement of purpose and need shall include a clear statement of the objectives that the proposed action is intended to achieve, which may include: (a) Achieving a transportation objective identified in an applicable statewide or metropolitan transportation plan; (b) supporting land use, economic development, or growth objectives established in applicable Federal, State, local, or Tribal plans; and (c) serving national defense, national security, or other national objectives, as established in Federal laws, plans, or policies.</P>
              <P>The transportation planning process can be utilized to develop the purpose and need in the following ways:</P>
              <P>(a) Goals and objectives from the transportation planning process may be part of the project's purpose and need statement;</P>
              <P>(b) A general travel corridor or general mode or modes (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination) resulting from planning analyses may be part of the project's purpose and need statement;</P>
              <P>(c) If the financial plan for a metropolitan transportation plan indicates that funding for a specific project will require special funding sources (e.g., tolls or public-private financing), such information may be included in the purpose and need statement; or</P>
              <P>(d) The results of analyses from management systems (e.g., congestion, pavement, bridge, and/or safety) may shape the purpose and need statement.</P>
              <P>The use of these planning-level goals and choices must be appropriately explained during NEPA scoping and in the NEPA document.</P>
              <P>Consistent with NEPA, the purpose and need statement should be a statement of a transportation problem, not a specific solution. However, the purpose and need statement should be specific enough to generate alternatives that may potentially yield real solutions to the problem at-hand. A purpose and need statement that yields only one alternative may indicate a purpose and need that is too narrowly defined.</P>
              <P>Short of a fully integrated transportation decision-making process, many State DOTs develop information for their purpose and need statements when implementing interagency NEPA/Section 404 process merger agreements. These agreements may need to be expanded to include commitments to share and utilize transportation planning products when developing a project's purpose and need.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9. Under what conditions can the NEPA process be initiated in conjunction with transportation planning studies?</HD>
              <P>The NEPA process may be initiated in conjunction with transportation planning studies in a number of ways. A common method is the “tiered EIS,” in which the first-tier EIS evaluates general travel corridors, modes, and/or packages of projects at a planning level of detail, leading to the refinement of purpose and need and, ideally, selection of the design concept and scope for a project or series of projects. Subsequently, second-tier NEPA review(s) of the resulting projects would be performed in the usual way. The first-tier EIS uses the NEPA process as a tool to involve environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies and the public in the planning decisions, as well as to ensure the appropriate consideration of environmental factors in these planning decisions.</P>
              <P>Corridor or subarea analyses/studies are another option when the long-range transportation plan leaves open the possibility of multiple approaches to fulfill its goals and objectives. In such cases, the formal NEPA process could be initiated through publication of a NOI in conjunction with a corridor or subarea planning study.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternatives</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">10. In the context of this Appendix, what is the meaning of the term “alternatives”?</HD>

              <P>This Appendix uses the term “alternatives” as specified in the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.14), where it is defined in its broadest sense to include everything from <PRTPAGE P="149"/>major modal alternatives and location alternatives to minor design changes that would mitigate adverse impacts. This Appendix does not use the term as it is used in many other contexts (e.g., “prudent and feasible alternatives” under Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act or the “Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative” under the Clean Water Act.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">11. Under what circumstances can alternatives be eliminated from detailed consideration during the NEPA process based on information and analysis from the transportation planning process?</HD>
              <P>There are two ways in which the transportation planning process can begin limiting the alternative solutions to be evaluated during the NEPA process: (a) Shaping the purpose and need for the project; or (b) evaluating alternatives during planning studies and eliminating some of the alternatives from detailed study in the NEPA process prior to its start. Each approach requires careful attention, and is summarized below.</P>
              <P>(a) Shaping the Purpose and Need for the Project: The transportation planning process should shape the purpose and need and, thereby, the range of reasonable alternatives. With proper documentation and public involvement, a purpose and need derived from the planning process can legitimately narrow the alternatives analyzed in the NEPA process. See the response to Question 8 for further discussion on how the planning process can shape the purpose and need used in the NEPA process.</P>
              <P>For example, the purpose and need may be shaped by the transportation planning process in a manner that consequently narrows the range of alternatives that must be considered in detail in the NEPA document when:</P>
              <P>(1) The transportation planning process has selected a general travel corridor as best addressing identified transportation problems and the rationale for the determination in the planning document is reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA document;</P>
              <P>(2) The transportation planning process has selected a general mode (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination) that accomplishes its goals and objectives, and these documented determinations are reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA document; or</P>
              <P>(3) The transportation planning process determines that the project needs to be funded by tolls or other non-traditional funding sources in order for the long-range transportation plan to be fiscally constrained or identifies goals and objectives that can only be met by toll roads or other non-traditional funding sources, and that determination of those goals and objectives is reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA document.</P>
              <P>(b) Evaluating and Eliminating Alternatives During the Transportation Planning Process: The evaluation and elimination of alternatives during the transportation planning process can be incorporated by reference into a NEPA document under certain circumstances. In these cases, the planning study becomes part of the NEPA process and provides a basis for screening out alternatives. As with any part of the NEPA process, the analysis of alternatives to be incorporated from the process must have a rational basis that has been thoroughly documented (including documentation of the necessary and appropriate vetting through the applicable public involvement processes). This record should be made available for public review during the NEPA scoping process.</P>
              <P>See responses to Questions 4, 5, 6, and 7 for additional elements to consider with respect to acceptance of planning products for NEPA documentation and the response to Question 12 on the information or analysis from the transportation planning process necessary for supporting the elimination of an alternative(s) from detailed consideration in the NEPA process.</P>
              <P>Development of planning Alternatives Analysis studies, required prior to MAP-21 for projects seeking funds through FTA's Capital Investment Grant program, are now optional, but may still be used to narrow the alternatives prior to the NEPA review, just as other planning studies may be used. In fact, through planning studies, FTA may be able to narrow the alternatives considered in detail in the NEPA document to the No-Build (No Action) alternative and the Locally Preferred Alternative. If the planning process has included the analysis and stakeholder involvement that would be undertaken in a first tier NEPA process, then the alternatives screening conducted in the transportation planning process may be incorporated by reference, described, and relied upon in the project-level NEPA document. At that point, the project-level NEPA analysis can focus on the remaining alternatives.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">12. What information or analysis from the transportation planning process is needed in an EA or EIS to support the elimination of an alternative(s) from detailed consideration?</HD>
              <P>The section of the EA or EIS that discusses alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed consideration should:</P>

              <P>(a) Identify any alternatives eliminated during the transportation planning process (this could include broad categories of alternatives, as when a long-range transportation plan selects a general travel corridor based on a corridor study, thereby eliminating all alternatives along other alignments);<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Briefly summarize the reasons for eliminating the alternative; and</P>
              <P>(c) Include a summary of the analysis process that supports the elimination of alternatives (the summary should reference the relevant sections or pages of the analysis or study) and incorporate it by reference or append it to the NEPA document.</P>
              <P>Any analyses or studies used to eliminate alternatives from detailed consideration should be made available to the public and participating agencies during the NEPA scoping process and should be reasonably available during comment periods.</P>
              <P>Alternatives passed over during the transportation planning process because they are infeasible or do not meet the NEPA “purpose and need” can be omitted from the detailed analysis of alternatives in the NEPA document, as long as the rationale for elimination is explained in the NEPA document. Alternatives that remain “reasonable” after the planning-level analysis must be addressed in the EIS, even when they are not the preferred alternative. When the proposed action evaluated in an EA involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources, NEPA requires that appropriate alternatives be studied, developed, and described.</P>

              <P>• Local land use, growth management, or development plans; and</P>
              <P>• Population and employment projections.</P>
              <P>The following are types of information, analysis, and other products from the transportation planning process that can be used in the discussion of the affected environment and environmental consequences in an EA or EIS:</P>
              <P>(a) Geographic information system (GIS) overlays showing the past, current, or predicted future conditions of the natural and built environments;</P>
              <P>(b) Environmental scans that identify environmental resources and environmentally sensitive areas;</P>
              <P>(c) Descriptions of airsheds and watersheds;</P>
              <P>(d) Demographic trends and forecasts;</P>
              <P>(e) Projections of future land use, natural resource conservation areas, and development; and</P>
              <P>(f) The outputs of natural resource planning efforts, such as wildlife conservation plans, watershed plans, special area management plans, and multiple species habitat conservation plans.</P>
              <P>However, in most cases, the assessment of the affected environment and environmental consequences conducted during the transportation planning process will not be detailed or current enough to meet NEPA standards and, thus, the inventory and evaluation of affected resources and the analysis of consequences of the alternatives will need to be supplemented with more refined analysis and possibly site-specific details during the NEPA process.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">14. What information from the transportation planning process is useful in describing a baseline for the NEPA analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts?</HD>
              <P>Because the nature of the transportation planning process is to look broadly at future land use, development, population increases, and other growth factors, the planning analysis can provide the basis for the assessment of indirect and cumulative impacts required under NEPA. The consideration in the transportation planning process of development, growth, and consistency with local land use, growth management, or development plans, as well as population and employment projections, provides an overview of the multitude of factors in an area that are creating pressures not only on the transportation system, but on the natural ecosystem and important environmental and community resources. An analysis of all reasonably foreseeable actions in the area also should be a part of the transportation planning process. This planning-level information should be captured and utilized in the analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts during the NEPA process.</P>
              <P>To be used in the analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts, such information should:</P>
              <P>(a) Be sufficiently detailed that differences in consequences of alternatives can be readily identified;</P>
              <P>(b) Be based on current data (e.g., data from the most recent Census) or be updated by additional information;</P>
              <P>(c) Be based on reasonable assumptions that are clearly stated; and/or</P>

              <P>(d) Rely on analytical methods and modeling techniques that are reliable, defensible, and reasonably current.<PRTPAGE P="151"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Mitigation</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">15. How can planning-level efforts best support advance mitigation, mitigation banking, and priorities for environmental mitigation investments?</HD>
              <P>A lesson learned from efforts to establish mitigation banks and advance mitigation agreements and alternative mitigation options is the importance of beginning interagency discussions during the transportation planning process. Development pressures, habitat alteration, complicated real estate transactions, and competition for potential mitigation sites by public and private project proponents can encumber the already difficult task of mitigating for “like” value and function and reinforce the need to examine mitigation strategies as early as possible.</P>
              <P>Robust use of remote sensing, GIS, and decision support systems for evaluating conservation strategies are all contributing to the advancement of natural resource and environmental planning. The outputs from environmental planning can now better inform transportation planning processes, including the development of mitigation strategies, so that transportation and conservation goals can be optimally met. For example, long-range transportation plans can be screened to assess the effect of general travel corridors or density, on the viability of sensitive plant and animal species or habitats. This type of screening provides a basis for early collaboration among transportation and environmental staffs, the public, and regulatory agencies to explore areas where impacts must be avoided and identify areas for mitigation investments. This can lead to mitigation strategies that are both more economical and more effective from an environmental stewardship perspective than traditional project-specific mitigation measures.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Administrative Issues</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">16. Are Federal funds eligible to pay for these additional, or more in depth, environmental studies in transportation planning?</HD>
              <P>Yes. For example, the following FHWA and FTA funds may be utilized for conducting environmental studies and analyses within transportation planning:</P>
              <P>• FHWA planning and research funds, as defined under 23 CFR part 420 (e.g., Metropolitan Planning (PL), Statewide Planning and Research (SPR), National Highway System (NHS), STP, and Equity Bonus); and</P>
              <P>• FTA planning and research funds (49 U.S.C. 5303), urban formula funds (49 U.S.C. 5307), and (in limited circumstances) transit capital investment funds (49 U.S.C. 5309).</P>
              <P>The eligible transportation planning-related uses of these funds may include: (a) Conducting feasibility or subarea/corridor needs studies and (b) developing system-wide environmental information/inventories (e.g., wetland banking inventories or standards to identify historically significant sites). Particularly in the case of PL and SPR funds, the proposed expenditure must be closely related to the development of transportation plans and programs under 23 U.S.C. 134-135 and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5306.</P>
              <P>For FHWA funding programs, once a general travel corridor or specific project has progressed to a point in the preliminary engineering/NEPA phase that clearly extends beyond transportation planning, additional in-depth environmental studies must be funded through the program category for which the ultimate project qualifies (e.g., NHS, STP, Interstate Maintenance, and/or Bridge), rather than PL or SPR funds.</P>
              <P>Another source of funding is FHWA's Transportation Enhancement program, which may be used for activities such as: conducting archeological planning and research; developing inventories such as those for historic bridges and highways, and other surface transportation-related structures; conducting studies to determine the extent of water pollution due to highway runoff; and conducting studies to reduce vehicle-caused wildlife mortality while maintaining habitat connectivity.</P>
              <P>The FHWA and the FTA encourage State DOTs, MPOs, and public transportation operators to seek partners for some of these studies from environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies, non-government organizations, and other government and private sector entities with similar data needs, or environmental interests. In some cases, these partners may contribute data and expertise to the studies, as well as funding.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">17. What staffing or organizational arrangements may be helpful in allowing planning products to be accepted in the NEPA process?</HD>

              <P>Certain organizational and staffing arrangements may support a more integrated approach to the planning/NEPA decision-making continuum. In many cases, planning organizations do not have environmental expertise on staff or readily accessible. Likewise, the review and regulatory responsibilities of many environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies make involvement in the transportation planning process a challenge for staff resources. These challenges may be partially met by improved use of the outputs of each agency's planning resources and by augmenting their capabilities through greater use of GIS and remote sensing technologies (see <E T="03">http://www.gis.fhwa.dot.gov/</E> for additional information on the use of GIS). Sharing databases and the planning products of local land use decision-makers and State and Federal environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies also provide efficiencies in <PRTPAGE P="152"/>acquiring and sharing the data and information needed for both transportation planning and NEPA work.</P>
              <P>Additional opportunities such as shared staff, training across disciplines, and (in some cases) reorganizing to eliminate structural divisions between planning and NEPA practitioners may also need to be considered in order to better integrate NEPA considerations into transportation planning studies. The answers to the following two questions also contain useful information on training and staffing opportunities.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">18. How have environmental, regulatory, and resource agency liaisons (Federally and State DOT funded positions) and partnership agreements been used to provide the expertise and interagency participation needed to enhance the consideration of environmental factors in the planning process?</HD>

              <P>For several years, States have utilized Federal and State transportation funds to support focused and accelerated project review by a variety of local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. While Section 1309(e) of the TEA-21 and its successor in SAFETEA-LU section 6002 speak specifically to transportation project streamlining, there are other authorities that have been used to fund positions, such as the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6505). In addition, long-term, on-call consultant contracts can provide backfill support for staff that are detailed to other parts of an agency for temporary assignments. At last count (as of 2015), over 200 positions were being funded. Additional information on interagency funding agreements is available at: <E T="03">http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/igdocs/index.htm</E>.</P>
              <P>Moreover, every State has advanced a variety of stewardship and streamlining initiatives that necessitate early involvement of environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies in the project development process. Such process improvements have: addressed the exchange of data to support avoidance and impact analysis; established formal and informal consultation and review schedules; advanced mitigation strategies; and resulted in a variety of programmatic reviews. Interagency agreements and work plans have evolved to describe performance objectives, as well as specific roles and responsibilities related to new streamlining initiatives. Some States have improved collaboration and efficiency by co-locating environmental, regulatory, and resource and transportation agency staff.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">19. What training opportunities are available to MPOs, State DOTs, public transportation operators and environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies to assist in their understanding of the transportation planning and NEPA processes?</HD>
              <P>Both the FHWA and the FTA offer a variety of transportation planning, public involvement, and NEPA courses through the National Highway Institute and/or the National Transit Institute. Of particular note is the Linking Planning and NEPA Workshop, which provides a forum and facilitated group discussion among and between State DOT; MPO; Federal, Tribal, and State environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies; and FHWA/FTA representatives (at both the executive and program manager levels) to develop a State-specific action plan that will provide for strengthened linkages between the transportation planning and NEPA processes.</P>
              <P>Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offers Green Infrastructure Workshops that are focused on integrating planning for natural resources (“green infrastructure”) with the development, economic, and other infrastructure needs of society (“gray infrastructure”).</P>
              <P>Robust planning and multi-issue environmental screening requires input from a wide variety of disciplines, including information technology; transportation planning; the NEPA process; and regulatory, permitting, and environmental specialty areas (e.g., noise, air quality, and biology). Senior managers at transportation and partner agencies can arrange a variety of individual training programs to support learning curves and skill development that contribute to a strengthened link of the transportation planning and NEPA processes. Formal and informal mentoring on an intra-agency basis can be arranged. Employee exchanges within and between agencies can be periodically scheduled, and persons involved with professional leadership programs can seek temporary assignments with partner agencies.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 470—Guidance Criteria for Evaluating Requests for Interstate System Designations under 23 U.S.C. 103(<E T="01">c</E>)(4)(A) and (B)</HD>
              <P>Section 103(c)(4)(A) and (B), of title 23, U.S.C., permits States to request the designation of National Highway System routes as parts or future parts of the Interstate System. The FHWA Administrator may approve such a request if the route is a logical addition or connection to the Interstate System and has been, or will be, constructed to meet Interstate standards. The following are the general criteria to be used to evaluate 23 U.S.C. 103(c) requests for Interstate System designations.</P>
              <P>1. The proposed route should be of sufficient length to serve long-distance Interstate travel, such as connecting routes between principal metropolitan cities or industrial centers important to national defense and economic development.</P>
              <P>2. The proposed route should not duplicate other Interstate routes. It should serve Interstate traffic movement not provided by another Interstate route.</P>
              <P>3. The proposed route should directly serve major highway traffic generators. The term “major highway traffic generator” means either an urbanized area with a population over 100,000 or a similar major concentrated land use activity that produces and attracts long-distance Interstate and statewide travel of persons and goods. Typical examples of similar major concentrated land use activities would include a principal industrial complex, government center, military installation, or transportation terminal.</P>
              <P>4. The proposed route should connect to the Interstate System at each end, with the exception of Interstate routes that connect with continental routes at an international border, or terminate in a “major highway traffic generator” that is not served by another Interstate route. In the latter case, the terminus of the Interstate route should connect to routes of the National Highway System that will adequately handle the traffic. The proposed route also must be functionally classified as a principal arterial and be a part of the National Highway System system.</P>
              <P>5. The proposed route must meet all the current geometric and safety standards criteria as set forth in 23 CFR part 625 for highways on the Interstate System, or a formal agreement to construct the route to such standards within 25 years must be executed between the State(s) and the Federal Highway Administration. Any proposed exceptions to the standards shall be approved at the time of designation.</P>
              <P>6. A route being proposed for designation under 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(B) must have an approved final environmental document (including, if required, a 49 U.S.C. 303(c) [Section 4(f)] approval) covering the route and project action must be ready to proceed with design at the time of designation. Routes constructed to Interstate standards are not necessarily logical additions to the Interstate System unless they clearly meet all of the above criteria.</P>

              <P>The following guidance is comparable to current procedures for Interstate System designation requests under 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(A). All Interstate System additions must be approved by the Federal Highway Administrator.

              <P>1. The request must be submitted through the appropriate FHWA Division Office to the Associate Administrator for Program Development (HEP-10). Comments and recommendations by the division and regional offices are requested.</P>
              <P>2. The State DOT secretary (or equivalent) must request that the route segment be added to the Interstate System. The exact location and termini must be specified. If the route segment involves more than one State, each affected State must submit a separate request.</P>

              <P>3. The request must provide information to support findings that the segment (a) is built to Interstate design standards and (b) connects to the existing Interstate System. The segment should be of sufficient length to <PRTPAGE P="158"/>provide substantial service to the travelling public.</P>

              <P>Section 103(b), of title 23, U.S.C., allows the States to propose modifications to the National Highway System (NHS) and authorizes the Secretary to approve such modifications provided that they meet the criteria established for the NHS and enhance the characteristics of the NHS. In proposing modifications under 23 U.S.C. 103(b), the States must cooperate with local and regional officials. In urbanized areas, the local officials must act through the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) designated for such areas under 23 U.S.C. 134. The following guidance criteria should be used by the States to develop proposed modifications to the NHS.</P>
              <P>1. Proposed additions to the NHS should be included in either an adopted State or metropolitan transportation plan or program.</P>
              <P>2. Proposed additions should connect at each end with other routes on the NHS or serve a major traffic generator.</P>
              <P>3. Proposals should be developed in consultation with local and regional officials.</P>

              <P>4. Proposals to add routes to the NHS should include information on the type of traffic served (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, percent of trucks, average trip length, local, commuter, interregional, interstate) by the route, the population centers or major traffic generators served by the route, and how this service compares with existing NHS routes.</P>
              <P>5. Proposals should include information on existing and anticipated needs and any planned improvements to the route.</P>
              <P>6. Proposals should include information concerning the possible effects of adding or deleting a route to or from the NHS might have on other existing NHS routes that are in close proximity.</P>

              <P>7. Proposals to add routes to the NHS should include an assessment of whether modifications (adjustments or deletions) to <PRTPAGE P="159"/>existing NHS routes, which provide similar service, may be appropriate.</P>
              <P>8. Proposed modifications that might affect adjoining States should be developed in cooperation with those States.</P>
              <P>9. Proposed modifications consisting of connections to major intermodal facilities should be developed using the criteria set forth below. These criteria were used for identifying initial NHS connections to major intermodal terminals. The primary criteria are based on annual passenger volumes, annual freight volumes, or daily vehicular traffic on one or more principal routes that serve the intermodal facility. The secondary criteria include factors which underscore the importance of an intermodal facility within a specific State.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Primary Criteria</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Commercial Aviation Airports</HD>
              <P>1. Passengers—scheduled commercial service with more than 250,000 annual enplanements.</P>
              <P>2. Cargo—100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal connecting route, or 100,000 tons per year arriving or departing by highway mode.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Ports</HD>
              <P>1. Terminals that handle more than 50,000 TEUs (a volumetric measure of containerized cargo which stands for twenty-foot equivalent units) per year, or other units measured that would convert to more than 100 trucks per day in each direction. (Trucks are defined as large single-unit trucks or combination vehicles handling freight.)</P>
              <P>2. Bulk commodity terminals that handle more than 500,000 tons per year by highway or 100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal connecting route. (If no individual terminal handles this amount of freight, but a cluster of terminals in close proximity to each other does, then the cluster of terminals could be considered in meeting the criteria. In such cases, the connecting route might terminate at a point where the traffic to several terminals begins to separate.)</P>
              <P>3. Passengers—terminals that handle more than 250,000 passengers per year or 1,000 passengers per day for at least 90 days during the year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Truck/Rail</HD>
              <P>1. 50,000 TEUs per year, or 100 trucks per day, in each direction on the principal connecting route, or other units measured that would convert to more than 100 trucks per day in each direction.

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Ferries</HD>
              <P>1. Interstate/international—1,000 passengers per day for at least 90 days during the year. (A ferry which connects two terminals within the same metropolitan area should be considered as local, not interstate.)</P>
              <P>2. Local—see public transit criteria above.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Secondary Criteria</HD>

              <P>1. Intermodal terminals that handle more than 20 percent of passenger or freight volumes by mode within a State;</P>
              <P>2. Intermodal terminals identified either in the Intermodal Management System or the State and metropolitan transportation plans as a major facility;</P>
              <P>3. Significant investment in, or expansion of, an intermodal terminal; or</P>
              <P>4. Connecting routes targeted by the State, MPO, or others for investment to address an existing, or anticipated, deficiency as a result of increased traffic.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proximate Connections</HD>

              <P>Intermodal terminals, identified under the secondary criteria noted above, may not have sufficient highway traffic volumes to justify an NHS connection to the terminal.

              <P>(2) The performance measure for the rate of fatalities is the 5-year rolling average of the State's fatality rate per VMT and shall be calculated by first calculating the number of fatalities per 100 million VMT for each of the most <PRTPAGE P="181"/>recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, adding the results, dividing by 5, and rounding to the thousandth decimal place. The FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available. State VMT data are derived from the HPMS. The Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) VMT is estimated by the MPO. The sum of the fatality rates is divided by five and then rounded to the thousandth decimal place.</P>
              <P>(3) The performance measure for the number of serious injuries is the 5-year rolling average of the total number of serious injuries for each State and shall be calculated by adding the number of serious injuries for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, dividing by five, and rounding to the tenth decimal place.</P>
              <P>(4) The performance measure for the rate of serious injuries is the 5-year rolling average of the State's serious injuries rate per VMT and shall be calculated by first calculating the number of serious injuries per 100 million VMT for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, adding the results, dividing by five, and rounding to the thousandth decimal place. State VMT data are derived from the HPMS. The MPO VMT is estimated by the MPO.</P>
              <P>(5) The performance measure for the number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries is the 5-year rolling average of the total number of non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries for each State and shall be calculated by adding the number of non-motorized fatalities to the number non-motorized serious injuries for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, dividing by five, and rounding to the tenth decimal place. FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Calculation of performance management measures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The pavement measures in § 490.307 shall be calculated in accordance with this section and used by State DOTs and MPOs to carry out the pavement condition related requirements of this part, and by FHWA to make the significant progress and minimum condition determinations specified in §§ 490.109 and 490.317, respectively.</P>
              <P>(b) The performance measure for pavements shall be calculated based on the data collected in § 490.309 and pavement condition metrics computed in § 490.311.

              <P>(i) Less than 95, the IRI rating for the pavement section is Good;</P>
              <P>(ii) Between 95 and 170, the IRI rating for the pavement section is Fair; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Greater than 170, the IRI rating for the pavement section is Poor.</P>

              <P>(A) If the Cracking_Percent value of a section is less than 5 percent, the cracking rating for the pavement section is Good;</P>
              <P>(B) If the Cracking_Percent value of a section is equal to or greater than 5 percent and less than or equal to 15 percent the cracking rating for the pavement section is Fair; and</P>
              <P>(C) If the Cracking_Percent value of a section is greater than 15 percent the cracking rating for the pavement section is Poor.</P>
              <P>(iii) For CRCP sections:</P>
              <P>(A) If the Cracking_Percent value of a section is less than 5 percent, the cracking rating for the pavement section is Good;</P>
              <P>(B) If the Cracking_Percent value of a section is equal to or greater than 5 percent and less than or equal to 10 percent, the cracking rating for the pavement section is Fair; and</P>

              <P>(3) Rutting or faulting rating shall be determined using the following criteria.</P>
              <P>(i) For asphalt pavement:</P>
              <P>(A) If the rutting value of a section is less than 0.20 inches, the rutting rating for the pavement section is Good;</P>
              <P>(B) If the rutting value of a section is equal to or greater than 0.20 inches and less than or equal to 0.40 inches, the rutting rating for the pavement section is Fair; and</P>
              <P>(C) If the rutting value of a section in is greater than 0.40 inches, the rutting rating for the pavement section is Poor.</P>
              <P>(ii) For jointed concrete pavement:</P>

              <P>(i) Total mainline lane-miles of missing, invalid, or unresolved sections for Interstate System and non-Interstate NHS shall be limited to no more than 5 percent of the total lane miles less the sections excluded in § 490.313(f)(1). For each pavement section without collected its condition metrics and inventory data, State DOTs shall note in the HPMS submittal with a specific code identified in the HPMS Field Manual (incorporated by reference, see § 490.111) noting the reason it was not collected.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calculation of overall pavement conditions in any State meeting the requirements of § 490.309(b) shall be based only on sections containing data reported in the HPMS Submittal as of the submission dates required in § 490.311(c)(4) and (5). State DOTs not meeting the requirements of § 490.309(b) will be considered as not in compliance with § 420.105(b) requiring State DOTs to submit data to the HPMS and not in compliance with § 490.107 requiring reporting on performance targets. Failure to report data meeting the requirements of § 490.309(b) by the submission dates for the Interstate System will be considered as not meeting the minimum requirements for pavement conditions on the Interstate System and that State DOT is subject to the penalties in § 490.315.</P>
              <P>(c) The Overall condition for asphalt and jointed concrete pavement sections shall be determined based on the ratings for IRI, Cracking_Percent, rutting and faulting, as described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, respectively, for each section as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Good only if the section is exhibiting Good ratings for all three conditions (IRI, Cracking_Percent, and rutting or faulting);</P>
              <P>(2) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Poor if two or more of the three conditions are exhibiting Poor ratings (at least two ratings of Poor for IRI, Cracking_Percent, and rutting or faulting).</P>
              <P>(3) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Fair if it does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) For sections on roadways where the posted speed limit is less than 40 MPH and where the State DOT has reported PSR in lieu of the IRI, Cracking_Percent, rutting, and faulting metrics the PSR condition level shall be determined using the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) If the PSR of a section is equal to or greater than 4.0 the PSR rating for the pavement section is Good;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the PSR of a section is less than 4.0 and greater than 2.0 the PSR rating for the pavement section is Fair; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the PSR of a section is less than or equal to 2.0 the PSR rating for the pavement section is Poor.</P>
              <P>(d) The Overall condition for CRCP sections shall be determined based on two ratings of IRI and Cracking_Percent, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section or based on PSR where appropriate as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, respectively, for each section as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Good only if the section is exhibiting Good ratings for both conditions (IRI and Cracking_Percent);</P>
              <P>(2) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Poor if it exhibits Poor ratings for both conditions (IRI and Cracking_Percent);</P>
              <P>(3) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Fair if it does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) For pavement sections that are on roadways with a posted speed limit of less than 40 MPH where the State DOT reported the PSR metric in lieu of the IRI, Cracking_Percent, faulting, and rutting metrics the pavement section shall be rated an overall condition equal to the PSR condition rating as described in section (c)(4) above<PRTPAGE P="191"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) State DOTs shall not be subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for Pavements on the until after the data collection cycle ending December 31, 2018, for Interstate highways and December 31, 2021, for the non-Interstate NHS. During this transition period, the Overall condition for all pavement types will be based on IRI rating, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or on PSR as described in paragraphs (c)(4) or (d)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The pavement condition measures in § 490.307 shall be computed as described below. The measures shall be used for establishing targets in accordance with § 490.105 and reporting the conditions of the pavements in the biennial performance reporting required in § 490.107 as follows:</P>

              <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) To carry out the NHPP, two of the three classifications are performance measures for State DOTs to use to assess bridge condition on the NHS. They are:</P>
              <P>(1) Percentage of NHS bridges classified as in Good condition; and</P>
              <P>(2) Percentage of NHS bridges classified as in Poor condition.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Calculation of National performance management measures for assessing bridge condition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The bridge measures in § 490.407 shall be calculated in accordance with this section and used by State DOTs and MPOs to carry out the bridge condition related requirements of this part and by FHWA to make the significant progress determination specified in § 490.109.</P>

              <P>(b) The condition of bridges carrying the NHS, which includes on- and off-ramps connected to the NHS, shall be classified as Good, Fair, or Poor following the criteria specified in this paragraph. The assignment of a classification of Good, Fair, or Poor shall be based on the bridge's condition ratings for NBI Items 58—Deck, 59—Superstructure, 60—Substructure, and 62—Culverts. For the purposes of national performance measures under the NHPP, the method of assessment to determine the classification of a bridge will be the minimum of condition rating method (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the condition ratings for lowest rating of a bridge's 3 NBI Items, 58—Deck, 59—Superstructure, and 60—Substructure). For culverts, the rating of its NBI Item, 62—Culverts, will determine its classification. The bridges carrying the NHS which includes on- and off-ramps connected to the NHS will be classified as Good, Fair, or Poor based on the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Good:</E> When the lowest rating of the 3 NBI items for a bridge (Items 58—Deck, 59—Superstructure, 60—Substructure) is 7, 8, or 9, the bridge will be classified as Good. When the rating of NBI item for a culvert (Item 62—Culverts) is 7, 8, or 9, the culvert will be classified as Good.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Fair:</E> When the lowest rating of the 3 NBI items for a bridge is 5 or 6, the bridge will be classified as Fair. When the rating of NBI item for a culvert is 5 or 6, the culvert will be classified as Fair.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Poor:</E> When the lowest rating of the 3 NBI items for a bridge is 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, the bridge will be classified as Poor. When the rating of NBI item for a culvert is 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, the culvert will be classified as Poor.</P>

              <P>(c) The bridge measures specified in § 490.407(c) shall be calculated for the <PRTPAGE P="195"/>applicable bridges per paragraph (a) that pertain to each target established by the State DOT or MPO in §§ 490.105(e) and 490.105(f), respectively, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For § 490.407(c)(1), the measure for the percentage of bridges classified as in Good condition shall be computed and reported to the one tenth of a percent as follows:</P>

              <P>(b) The State DOT shall calculate the LOTTR metrics for each NHS reporting segment in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Data sets shall be created from the travel time data set to be used to calculate the LOTTR metrics. This data set shall include, for each reporting segment, a ranked list of average travel times for all traffic (“all vehicles” in NPMRDS nomenclature), to the nearest second, for 15 minute periods of a population that:</P>
              <P>(i) Includes travel times occurring between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;</P>

              <P>(2) The Normal Travel Time (50th percentile) shall be determined from each data set defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the time in which 50 percent of the times in the data set are shorter in duration and 50 percent are longer in duration. The 80th percentile travel time shall be determined for each data set defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the time in which 80 percent of the times in the data set are shorter in duration and 20 percent are longer in duration. Both the Normal and 80th percentile travel times can be determined by plotting the data on a travel time cumulative probability distribution graph or using the percentile functions available in spreadsheet and other analytical tools.</P>
              <P>(3) Four LOTTR metrics shall be calculated for each reporting segment; one for each data set defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the 80th percentile travel time divided by the 50th percentile travel time and rounded to the nearest hundredth.</P>

              <P>(e) Starting in 2018 and annually thereafter, State DOTs shall report the LOTTR metrics, defined in paragraph (b) of this section, in accordance with HPMS Field Manual by June 15th of each year for the previous year's measures.</P>

              <P>(1) Metrics are reported to HPMS by reporting segment. All reporting segments where the NPMRDS is used shall be referenced by NPMRDS TMC(s) or HPMS section(s). If a State DOT elects to use, in part or in whole, the equivalent data set, all reporting segment <PRTPAGE P="199"/>shall be referenced by HPMS section(s); and</P>
              <P>(2) The LOTTR metric (to the nearest hundredths) for each of the four time periods identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section: the corresponding 80th percentile travel times (to the nearest second), the corresponding Normal (50th percentile) Travel Times (to the nearest second), and directional AADTs. If a State DOT does not elect to use FHWA supplied occupancy factor, as provided in § 490.507(d), that State DOT shall report vehicle occupancy factor (to the nearest tenth) to HPMS.</P>

The Percent of Non-SOV Travel measure shall be developed from the most recent data as of August 15th of the year in which the State Biennial Performance Report is due to FHWA.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Method B—local survey.</E> The Percent of Non-SOV Travel may be estimated from a local survey focused on either work travel or household travel for the area and conducted as recently as 2 years before the beginning of the performance period. The survey method shall estimate travel mode choice for the full urbanized area using industry accepted methodologies and approaches resulting in a margin of error that is acceptable to industry standards, allow for updates on at least a biennial frequency, and distinguish non-SOV travel occurring in the area as a percent of all work or household travel.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Method C—system use measurement.</E> The volume of travel using surface modes of transportation may be estimated from measurements of actual use of each transportation mode. Sample or continuous measurements may be used to count the number of <PRTPAGE P="204"/>travelers using different surface modes of transportation. The method used to count travelers shall estimate the total volume of annual travel for the full urbanized area within a margin of error that is acceptable to industry standards and allows for updates on at least a biennial frequency. The method shall include sufficient information to calculate the amount of non-SOV travel occurring in the area as a percentage of all surface transportation travel. State DOTs are encouraged to report use counts to FHWA that are not included in currently available national data sources.</P>
              <P>(2) State DOTs shall report the data collection method that is used to determine the Percent of Non-SOV Travel measure for each applicable urbanized area in the State to FHWA in their first Baseline Performance Period Report required in § 490.107(b)(1).

This method shall be used for the full performance period for each applicable urbanized area.</P>
              <P>(3) If State DOTs and MPOs that contribute to an applicable urbanized area elect to change the data collection method reported under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, then each respective State DOT shall report this change in their next Baseline Performance Report required in § 490.107(b)(1). The new method reported as a requirement of this paragraph shall not be used until the beginning of the next performance period for the Baseline Performance Report in which the method was reported to be changed.</P>
              <P>(g) Populations of urbanized areas shall be as identified based on the most recent annual estimates published by the U.S. Census available 1 year before the State DOT Baseline Performance Period Report is due to FHWA to identify applicability of the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures in § 490.707(a) and (b) for each performance period, as described in § 490.105(e)(8)(iii)(D) and (f)(5)(iii)(D). For computing the PHED measure in § 490.713(b), the most recent annual population estimate published by the U.S. Census, at the time when the State DOT Biennial Performance Period Report is due to FHWA shall be used.</P>
              <P>(h) Nonattainment and maintenance area determinations for the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures:</P>
              <P>(1) The CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures apply to nonattainment and maintenance areas. Such areas shall be identified based on the effective date of U.S. EPA's designations under the NAAQS in 40 CFR part 81, as of the date 1 year before the State DOT Baseline Performance Period Report is due to FHWA.</P>
              <P>(2) The nonattainment and maintenance areas to which the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures applies shall be revised if, on the date 1 year before the State DOT Mid Performance Period Progress Report is due to FHWA, the area is no longer in nonattainment or maintenance for a criteria pollutant included in § 490.703.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this part is to implement the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 303(a) which directs the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to issue regulations for State development, establishment, and implementation of systems for managing highway pavement of Federal-aid highways (PMS), bridges on and off Federal-aid highways (BMS), highway safety (SMS), traffic congestion (CMS), public transportation facilities and equipment (PTMS), and intermodal transportation facilities and systems (IMS). This regulation also implements 23 U.S.C. 303(b) which directs the Secretary to issue guidelines and requirements for State development, establishment, and implementation of a traffic monitoring system for highways and public transportation facilities and equipment (TMS).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Federal, State, and local governments are under increasing pressure to balance their budgets and, at the same time, respond to public demands for quality services. Along with the need to invest in America's future, this leaves transportation agencies with the task of trying to manage current transportation systems as cost-effectively as possible to meet evolving, as well as backlog needs. The use of existing or new transportation management systems provides a framework for cost-effective decision making that emphasizes enhanced service at reduced public and private life-cycle cost. The primary outcome of transportation management systems is improved system performance and safety. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) strongly encourage implementation of transportation management systems consistent with State, metropolitan planning organization, transit operator, or local government needs.</P>

              <P>(b) Whether the systems are developed under the provisions of this part or under a State's own procedures, the following categories of FHWA administered funds may be used for development, establishment, and implementation of any of the management systems and the traffic monitoring system: National highway system; surface transportation program; State planning and research and metropolitan planning funds (including the optional use of minimum allocation funds authorized under 23 U.S.C. 157(c) and restoration funds authorized under § 202(f) of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (Pub.L. 104-59) for carrying out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 307(c)(1) and 23 U.S.C. 134(a)); congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program funds for those management systems that can be shown to contribute to the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard; and apportioned bridge funds for development <PRTPAGE P="212"/>and establishment of the bridge management system. The following categories of FTA administered funds may be used for development, establishment, and implementation of the CMS, PTMS, IMS, and TMS: Metropolitan planning; State planning and research, and formula transit funds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>CMS.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of this part, congestion means the level at which transportation system performance is unacceptable due to excessive travel times and delays. Congestion management means the application of strategies to improve system performance and reliability by reducing the adverse impacts of congestion on the movement of people and goods in a region. A congestion management system or process is a systematic and regionally accepted approach for managing congestion that provides accurate, up-to-date information on transportation system operations and performance and assesses alternative strategies for congestion management that meet State and local needs.</P>
              <P>(b) The development of a congestion management system or process should result in performance measures and strategies that can be integrated into transportation plans and programs. The level of system performance deemed acceptable by State and local officials may vary by type of transportation facility, geographic location (metropolitan area or subarea and/or non-metropolitan area), and/or time of day. In both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration needs to be given to strategies that manage demand, reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) travel, and improve transportation system management and operations. Where the addition of general purpose lanes is determined to be an appropriate congestion management strategy, explicit consideration is to be given to the incorporation of appropriate features into the SOV project to facilitate future demand management strategies and operational improvements that will maintain the functional integrity of those lanes.</P>

The duration, geographic extent, and level of detail shall be consistent with the intended use of the data, as cooperatively agreed to by the organizations that will use the data and the organizations that will collect the data. Such vehicle occupancy data shall be reviewed at least every three years and updated as necessary. Acceptable data collection methods include roadside monitoring, traveler surveys, the use of administrative records (e.g., accident reports or reports developed in support of public transportation programs), or any other method mutually acceptable to the responsible organizations and the FHWA.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Field operations.</E> (1) Each State's TMS for highway traffic data shall include the testing of equipment used in the collection of the data. This testing shall be based on documented procedures developed by the State. This documentation will describe the test procedure as well as the frequency of testing. Standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials or guidance from the AASHTO may be used. Only equipment passing the test procedures will be used for the collection of data for the purposes identified in § 500.203(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Documentation of field operations shall include the number of counts, the period of monitoring, the cycle of monitoring, and the spatial and temporal distribution of count sites. Copies of the State's documentation shall be provided to the FHWA Division Administrator when it is initially developed and after each revision.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Source data retention.</E> For estimates of traffic or travel, the value or values collected during a monitoring session, as well as information on the date(s) and hour(s) of monitoring, will remain available until the traffic or travel estimates based on the count session are updated. Data shall be available in formats that conform to those in the version of the TMG current at the time of data collection or as then amended by the FHWA.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Office factoring procedures.</E> (1) Factors to adjust data from short term monitoring sessions to estimates of average daily conditions shall be used to adjust for month, day of week, axle correction, and growth or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. These factors will be reviewed annually and updated at least every three years.</P>

              <P>(2) The procedures used by a State to edit and adjust highway traffic data collected from short term counts at field locations to estimates of average traffic volume shall be documented. The documentation shall include the factors discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The documentation shall remain available as long as the traffic <PRTPAGE P="217"/>or travel estimates discussed in paragraph (g) of this section remain current. Copies of the State's documentation shall be provided to the FHWA Division Administrator when it is initially developed and after each revision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Process for establishing the asset management plan.</SUBJECT>

            <P>A State shall develop a risk-based asset management plan that describes how the NHS will be managed to achieve system performance effectiveness and State DOT targets for asset condition, while managing the risks, in a financially responsible manner, at a minimum practicable cost over the life <PRTPAGE P="225"/>cycle of its assets. The State DOT shall develop and use, at a minimum the following processes to prepare its asset management plan:</P>
            <P>(a) A State DOT shall establish a process for conducting performance gap analysis to identify deficiencies hindering progress toward improving or preserving the NHS and achieving and sustaining the desired state of good repair. At a minimum, the State DOT's process shall address the following in the gap analysis:</P>
            <P>(1) The State DOT targets for asset condition of NHS pavements and bridges as established by the State DOT under 23 U.S.C. 150(d) once promulgated.</P>
            <P>(2) The gaps, if any, in the performance-of the NHS that affect NHS pavements and bridges regardless of their physical condition; and</P>
            <P>(3) Alternative strategies to close or address the identified gaps.</P>
            <P>(b) A State DOT shall establish a process for conducting life-cycle planning for an asset class or asset sub-group at the network level (network to be defined by the State DOT). As a State DOT develops its life-cycle planning process, the State DOT should include future changes in demand; information on current and future environmental conditions including extreme weather events, climate change, and seismic activity; and other factors that could impact whole of life costs of assets. The State DOT may propose excluding one or more asset sub-groups from its life-cycle planning if the State DOT can demonstrate to FHWA the exclusion of the asset sub-group would have no material adverse effect on the development of sound investment strategies due to the limited number of assets in the asset sub-group, the low level of cost associated with managing the assets in that asset sub-group, or other justifiable reasons. A life-cycle planning process shall, at a minimum, include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The State DOT targets for asset condition for each asset class or asset sub-group;</P>
            <P>(2) Identification of deterioration models for each asset class or asset sub-group, provided that identification of deterioration models for assets other than NHS pavements and bridges is optional;</P>
            <P>(3) Potential work types across the whole life of each asset class or asset sub-group with their relative unit cost; and</P>
            <P>(4) A strategy for managing each asset class or asset sub-group by minimizing its life-cycle costs, while achieving the State DOT targets for asset condition for NHS pavements and bridges under 23 U.S.C. 150(d).</P>
            <P>(c) A State DOT shall establish a process for developing a risk management plan. This process shall, at a minimum, produce the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) Identification of risks that can affect condition of NHS pavements and bridges and the performance of the NHS, including risks associated with current and future environmental conditions, such as extreme weather events, climate change, seismic activity, and risks related to recurring damage and costs as identified through the evaluation of facilities repeated damaged by emergency events carried out under part 667 of this title. Examples of other risk categories include financial risks such as budget uncertainty; operational risks such as asset failure; and strategic risks such as environmental compliance.</P>
            <P>(2) An assessment of the identified risks in terms of the likelihood of their occurrence and their impact and consequence if they do occur;</P>
            <P>(3) An evaluation and prioritization of the identified risks;</P>
            <P>(4) A mitigation plan for addressing the top priority risks;</P>
            <P>(5) An approach for monitoring the top priority risks; and</P>
            <P>(6) A summary of the evaluations of facilities repeatedly damaged by emergency events carried out under part 667 of this title that discusses, at a minimum, the results relating to the State's NHS pavements and bridges.</P>
            <P>(d) A State DOT shall establish a process for the development of a financial plan that identifies annual costs over a minimum period of 10 years. The financial plan process shall, at a minimum, produce:</P>

            <P>(1) The estimated cost of expected future work to implement investment <PRTPAGE P="226"/>strategies contained in the asset management plan, by State fiscal year and work type;</P>
            <P>(2) The estimated funding levels that are expected to be reasonably available, by fiscal year, to address the costs of future work types. State DOTs may estimate the amount of available future funding using historical values where the future funding amount is uncertain;</P>
            <P>(3) Identification of anticipated funding sources; and</P>
            <P>(4) An estimate of the value of the agency's NHS pavement and bridge assets and the needed investment on an annual basis to maintain the value of these assets.</P>
            <P>(e) A State DOT shall establish a process for developing investment strategies meeting the requirements in § 515.9(f). This process must result in a description of how the investment strategies are influenced, at a minimum, by the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Performance gap analysis required under paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) Life-cycle planning for asset classes or asset sub-groups resulting from the process required under paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) Risk management analysis resulting from the process required under paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Asset management plan requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A State DOT shall develop and implement an asset management plan to improve or preserve the condition of the assets and improve the performance of the NHS in accordance with the requirements of this part. Asset management plans must describe how the State DOT will carry out asset management as defined in § 515.5.</P>
            <P>(b) An asset management plan shall include, at a minimum, a summary listing of NHS pavement and bridge assets, regardless of ownership.</P>
            <P>(c) In addition to the assets specified in paragraph (b) of this section, State DOTs are encouraged, but not required, to include all other NHS infrastructure assets within the right-of-way corridor and assets on other public roads. Examples of other NHS infrastructure assets include tunnels, ancillary structures, and signs. Examples of other public roads include non-NHS Federal-aid highways. If a State DOT decides to include other NHS assets in its asset management plan, or to include assets on other public roads, the State DOT, at a minimum, shall evaluate and manage those assets consistent with paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) The minimum content for an asset management plan under this part includes a discussion of each element in this paragraph (d).</P>
            <P>(1) Asset management objectives. The objectives should align with the State DOT's mission. The objectives must be consistent with the purpose of asset management, which is to achieve and sustain the desired state of good repair over the life cycle of the assets at a minimum practicable cost.</P>

            <P>(2) Asset management measures and State DOT targets for asset condition, including those established pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 150, for NHS pavements and bridges. The plan must include measures and associated targets the State DOT can use in assessing the condition of the assets and performance of the highway system as it relates to those assets. The measures and targets must be consistent with the State DOT's asset management objectives. The <PRTPAGE P="227"/>State DOT must include the measures established under 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(ii)(I)-(III), once promulgated in 23 CFR part 490, for the condition of NHS pavements and bridges. The State DOT also must include the targets the State DOT has established for the measures required by 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(ii)(I)-(III), once promulgated, and report on such targets in accordance with 23 CFR part 490. The State DOT may include measures and targets for NHS pavements and bridges that the State DOT established through pre-existing management efforts or develops through new efforts if the State DOT wishes to use such additional measures and targets to supplement information derived from the pavement and bridge measures and targets required under 23 U.S.C. 150.</P>
            <P>(3) A summary description of the condition of NHS pavements and bridges, regardless of ownership. The summary must include a description of the condition of those assets based on the performance measures established under 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(ii) for condition, once promulgated. The description of condition should be informed by evaluations required under part 667 of this title of facilities repeated damaged by emergency events.</P>
            <P>(4) Performance gap identification.</P>
            <P>(5) Life-cycle planning.</P>
            <P>(6) Risk management analysis, including the results for NHS pavements and bridges, of the periodic evaluations under part 667 of this title of facilities repeated damaged by emergency event.</P>
            <P>(7) Financial plan.</P>
            <P>(8) Investment strategies.</P>
            <P>(e) An asset management plan shall cover, at a minimum, a 10-year period.</P>
            <P>(f) An asset management plan shall discuss how the plan's investment strategies collectively would make or support progress toward:</P>
            <P>(1) Achieving and sustaining a desired state of good repair over the life cycle of the assets,</P>
            <P>(2) Improving or preserving the condition of the assets and the performance of the NHS relating to physical assets,</P>
            <P>(3) Achieving the State DOT targets for asset condition and performance of the NHS in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 150(d), and</P>
            <P>(4) Achieving the national goals identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(b).</P>
            <P>(g) A State DOT must include in its plan a description of how the analyses required by State processes developed in accordance with § 515.7 (such as analyses pertaining to life cycle planning, risk management, and performance gaps) support the State DOT's asset management plan investment strategies.</P>
            <P>(h) A State DOT shall integrate its asset management plan into its transportation planning processes that lead to the STIP, to support its efforts to achieve the goals in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) A State DOT is required to make its asset management plan available to the public, and is encouraged to do so in a format that is easily accessible.</P>
            <P>(j) Inclusion of performance measures and State DOT targets for NHS pavements and bridges established pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 150 in the asset management plan does not relieve the State DOT of any performance management requirements, including 23 U.S.C. 150(e) reporting, established in other parts of this title.</P>
            <P>(k) The head of the State DOT shall approve the asset management plan.</P>
            <P>(l) If the State DOT elects to include other NHS infrastructure assets or other public roads assets in its asset management plan, the State at a minimum shall address the following, using a level of effort consistent with the State DOT's needs and resources:</P>
            <P>(1) Summary listing of assets, including a description of asset condition;</P>
            <P>(2) Asset management measures and State DOT targets for asset condition;</P>
            <P>(3) Performance gap analysis;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Deadlines and phase-in of asset management plan development.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Deadlines.</E> (1) Not later than April 30, 2018, the State DOT shall submit to FHWA a State-approved initial asset management plan meeting the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. The FHWA will review the processes described in the initial plan and make a process certification decision as provided in § 515.13(a).</P>
            <P>(2) Not later than June 30, 2019, the State DOT shall submit a State-approved asset management plan meeting all the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part, including paragraph (c) of this section, together with documentation demonstrating implementation of the asset management plan. The FWHA will determine whether the State DOT's plan and implementation meet the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part as provided in § 515.13(b).</P>
            <P>(b) The initial plan shall describe the State DOT's processes for developing its risk-based asset management plan, including the policies, procedures, documentation, and implementation approach that satisfy the requirements of this part. The plan also must contain measures and targets for assets covered by the plan. The investment strategies required by § 515.7(e) and 515.9((d)(8) must support progress toward the achievement of the national goals identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(b). The initial plan must include and address the State DOT's 23 U.S.C. 150(d) targets for NHS pavements and bridges only if the first target-setting deadline established in 23 CFR part 490 for NHS pavements and bridges is a date more than 6 months before the initial plan submission deadline in paragraph (a)(1). The initial asset management plan may exclude one or more of the necessary analyses with respect to the following required asset management processes:</P>
            <P>(1) Life-cycle planning required under § 515.7(a)(2);</P>
            <P>(2) The risk management analysis required under § 515.7(a)(3); and</P>
            <P>(3) Financial plan under § 515.7(a)(4).</P>
            <P>(c) The State-approved asset management plan submitted not later than June 30, 2019, shall include all required analyses, performed using FHWA-certified processes, and the section 150 measures and State DOT targets for the NHS pavements and bridges. The plan must meet all requirements in §§ 515.7 and 515.9. This includes investment strategies that are developed based on the analyses from all processes required under § 515.7, and meet the requirements in 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(2).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 515.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Process certification and recertification, and annual plan consistency review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Process certification and recertification under 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(6).</E> Not later than 90 days after the date on which the FHWA receives a State DOT's processes and request for certification or recertification, the FHWA shall decide whether the State DOT's processes for developing its asset management plan meet the requirements of this part. The FHWA will treat the State DOT's submission of an initial State-approved asset management plan under § 515.11(b) as the State DOT's request for the first certification of the State's DOT's plan development processes under 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(6). As provided in paragraph (c) of this section, State DOT shall update and resubmit its asset management plan development processes to the FHWA for a new process certification at least every 4 years.</P>
            <P>(1) If FHWA determines that the processes used by a State DOT to develop and maintain the asset management plan do not meet the requirements established under this part, FHWA will send the State DOT a written notice of the denial of certification or recertification, including a listing of the specific requirement deficiencies.</P>

            <P>(2) Upon receiving a notice of denial of certification or recertification, the State DOT shall have 90 days from receipt of the notice to address the deficiencies identified in the notice and resubmit the State DOT's processes to FHWA for review and certification. The FHWA may extend the State DOT's 90-day period to cure deficiencies upon request. During the cure period established, all penalties and other legal impacts of a denial of certification shall be stayed as provided in 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(6)(C)(i).<PRTPAGE P="229"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) If FHWA finds that a State DOT's asset management processes substantially meet the requirements of this part except for minor deficiencies, FHWA may certify or recertify the State DOT's processes as being in compliance, but the State DOT must take actions to correct the minor deficiencies within 90 days of receipt of the notification of certification. The State shall notify FHWA, in writing, when corrective actions are completed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Annual determination of consistency under 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(5).</E> Not later than August 31, 2019, and not later than July 31 in each year thereafter, FHWA will notify the State DOT whether the State DOT has developed and implemented an asset management plan consistent with 23 U.S.C. 119. The notice will be in writing and, in the case of a negative determination, will specify the deficiencies the State DOT needs to address. In making the annual consistency determination, the FHWA will consider the most recent asset management plan submitted by the State DOT, as well as any documentation submitted by the State DOT to demonstrate implementation of the plan. The FHWA determination is only as to the consistency of the State DOT asset management plan and State DOT implementation of that plan with applicable requirements, and is not an approval or disapproval of strategies or other decisions contained in the plan. With respect to any assets the State DOT may elect to include in its plan in addition to NHS pavement and bridge assets, the FHWA consistency determination will consider only whether the State DOT has complied with § 515.9(l) with respect to such discretionary assets.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Plan development.</E> The FHWA will review the State DOT's asset management plan to ensure that it was developed with certified processes, includes the required content, and is consistent with other applicable requirements in this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Plan implementation.</E> The State DOT must demonstrate implementation of an asset management plan that meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part. Each State DOT may determine the most suitable approach for demonstrating implementation of its asset management plan, so long as the information is current, documented, and verifiable. The submission must show the State DOT is using the investment strategies in its plan to make progress toward achievement of its targets for asset condition and performance of the NHS and to support progress toward the national goals identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(b). The State DOT must submit its implementation documentation not less than 30 days prior to the deadline for the FHWA consistency determination.</P>

            <P>(i) FHWA considers the best evidence of plan implementation to be that, for the 12 months preceding the consistency determination, the State DOT funding allocations are reasonably consistent with the investment strategies in the State DOT's asset management plan. This demonstration takes into account the alignment between the actual and planned levels of investment for various work types (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> initial construction, maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation and reconstruction).</P>
            <P>(ii) FHWA may find a State DOT has implemented its asset management plan even if the State has deviated from the investment strategies included in the asset management plan, if the State DOT shows the deviation was necessary due to extenuating circumstances beyond the State DOT's reasonable control.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Opportunity to cure deficiencies.</E> In the event FHWA notifies a State DOT of a negative consistency determination, the State DOT has 30 days to address the deficiencies. The State DOT may submit additional information showing the FHWA negative determination was in error, or to demonstrate the State DOT has taken corrective action that resolves the deficiencies specified in FHWA's negative determination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Updates and other amendments to plans and development processes.</E> A State DOT must update its asset management plan and asset management plan development processes at least every 4 years, beginning on the date of the initial FHWA certification of the State DOT's processes under paragraph (a) of this section. Whenever the State DOT updates or otherwise amends its asset <PRTPAGE P="230"/>management plan or its asset management plan development processes, the State DOT must submit the amended plan or processes to the FHWA for a new process certification and consistency determination at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the next FHWA consistency determination under paragraph (b) of this section. Minor technical corrections and revisions with no foreseeable material impact on the accuracy and validity of the processes, analyses, or investment strategies in the plan do not constitute amendments and do not require submission to FHWA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Penalties</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Beginning on October 1, 2019, and in each fiscal year thereafter, if a State DOT has not developed and implemented an asset management plan consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part, the maximum Federal share for National Highway Performance Program projects and activities carried out by the State in that fiscal year shall be reduced to 65 percent for that fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the State DOT has not developed and implemented an asset management plan that is consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part and established the performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d) by the date that is 18 months after the effective date of the 23 U.S.C. 150(c) final rule for NHS pavements and bridges, the FHWA will not approve any further projects using National Highway Performance Program funds. Such suspension of funding approvals will terminate once the State DOT has developed and implemented an asset management plan that is consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part and established its performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d).</P>
            <P>(2) The FHWA may extend this deadline if FHWA determines that the State DOT has made a good faith effort to develop and implement an asset management plan and establish the performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d).</P>

State DOT bridge and pavement management systems are not subject to FHWA certification under § 515.13. Bridge and pavement management systems shall include, at a minimum, documented procedures for:</P>
            <P>(a) Collecting, processing, storing, and updating inventory and condition data for all NHS pavement and bridge assets.</P>
            <P>(b) Forecasting deterioration for all NHS pavement and bridge assets;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Organizational integration of asset management.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The purpose of this section is to describe how a State DOT may integrate asset management into its organizational mission, culture and capabilities at all levels. The activities described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section are not requirements.</P>

            <P>(b) A State DOT should establish organizational strategic goals and include the goals in its organizational strategic implementation plans with an explanation as to how asset management will help it to achieve those goals.<PRTPAGE P="231"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) A State DOT should conduct a periodic self-assessment of the agency's capabilities to conduct asset management, as well as its current efforts in implementing an asset management plan. The self-assessment should consider, at a minimum, the adequacy of the State DOT's strategic goals and policies with respect to asset management, whether asset management is considered in the agency's planning and programming of resources, including development of the STIP; whether the agency is implementing appropriate program delivery processes, such as consideration of alternative project delivery mechanisms, effective program management, and cost tracking and estimating; and whether the agency is implementing adequate data collection and analysis policies to support an effective asset management program.</P>
            <P>(d) Based on the results of the self-assessment, the State DOT should conduct a gap analysis to determine which areas of its asset management process require improvement. In conducting a gap analysis, the State DOT should:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine the level of organizational performance effort needed to achieve the objectives of asset management;</P>
            <P>(2) Determine the performance gaps between the existing level of performance effort and the needed level of performance effort; and</P>
            <P>(3) Develop strategies to close the identified organizational performance gaps and define the period of time over which the gap is to be closed.</P>

              <P>The provisions of this subpart apply to highway facilities where Federal-aid funds have participated in either right-of-way or physical construction costs of a project. The provisions of this subpart apply only to relinquishment of facilities for continued highway purposes. Other real property disposals and modifications or disposal of access rights are governed by the requirements of 23 CFR part 710.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) After final acceptance of a project on the Federal-aid primary, urban, or <PRTPAGE P="233"/>secondary system or after the date that the plans, specifications and estimates (PS&amp;E) for the physical construction on the right-of-way for a Federal-aid Interstate project have been approved by the FHWA, relinquishment of the right-of-way or any change made in control of access shall be in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this section, final acceptance for a project involving physical construction is the date of the acceptance of the physical construction by the FHWA and for right-of-way projects, the date the division engineer determines to be the date of the completion of the acquisition of the right-of-way shown on the final plans.</P>

              <P>(b) Other than a conveyance made as part of a concession agreement as defined in section 710.703, for purposes of this section, <E T="03">relinquishment</E> is defined as the conveyance of a portion of a highway right-of-way or facility by a State highway agency (SHA) to another Government agency for highway use.</P>
              <P>(c) The following facilities may be relinquished in accordance with paragraph 203(f):</P>
              <P>(1) Sections of a State highway which have been superseded by construction on new location and removed from the Federal-aid system and the replaced section thereof is approved by the FHWA as the new location of the Federal-aid route. Federal-aid funds may not participate in rehabilitation work performed for the purpose of placing the superseded section of the highway in a condition acceptable to the local authority. The relinquishment of any Interstate mileage shall be submitted to the Federal Highway Administrator as a special case for prior approval.</P>
              <P>(2) Sections of reconstructed local facilities that are located outside the control of access lines, such as turn-arounds of severed local roads or streets adjacent to the Federal-aid project's right-of-way, and local roads and streets crossing over or under said project that have been adjusted in grade and/or alignment, including new right-of-way required for adjustments. Eligibility for Federal-aid participation in the costs of the foregoing adjustments is as determined at the time of PS&amp;E approval under policies of the FHWA.</P>
              <P>(3) Frontage roads or portions thereof that are constructed generally parallel to and outside the control of access lines of a Federal-aid project for the purpose of permitting access to private properties rather than to serve as extensions of ramps to connect said Federal-aid project with the nearest crossroad or street.</P>
              <P>(d) The following facilities may be relinquished only with the approval of the Federal Highway Administrator in accordance with paragraph 203(g).</P>
              <P>(1) Frontage roads or portions thereof located outside the access control lines of a Federal-aid project that are constructed to service (in lieu of or in addition to the purposes outlined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section) as connections between ramps to or from the Federal-aid project and existing public roads or streets.</P>
              <P>(2) Ramps constructed to serve as connections for interchange of traffic between the Federal-aid project and local roads or streets.</P>
              <P>(e) Where a frontage road is not on an approved Federal-aid system title to the right-of-way may be acquired initially in the name of the political subdivision which is to assume control thus eliminating the necessity of a formal transfer later. Such procedure would be subject to prior FHWA approval and would be limited to those facilities which meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon presentation by a State that it intends to relinquish facilities such as described in paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section to local authorities, the division engineer of the FHWA shall have appropriate field and office examination made thereof to assure that such relinquishments are in accordance with the provisions of the cited paragraphs. Relinquishments of the types described in paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section may be made on an individual basis or on a project or route basis subject to the following conditions and understandings:</P>

              <P>(1) Immediately following action by the State in approving a relinquishment, it shall furnish to the Division Administrator for record purposes a <PRTPAGE P="234"/>copy of a suitable map or maps identified by the Federal-aid project number, with the facilities to be relinquished and the date of such relinquishment action clearly delineated thereon.</P>
              <P>(2) If it is found at any time after relinquishment that a relinquished facility is in fact required for the safe and proper operation of the Federal-aid highway, the State shall take immediate action to restore such facility to its jurisdiction without cost to Federal-aid highway funds.</P>
              <P>(3) If it is found at any time that a relinquished frontage road or portion thereof or any part of the right-of-way therefor has been abandoned by local governmental authority and a showing cannot be made that such abandoned facility is no longer required as a public road, it is to be understood that the Federal Highway Administrator may cause to be withheld from Federal-aid highway funds due to the State an amount equal to the Federal-aid participation in the abandoned facility.</P>
              <P>(4) In no case shall any relinquishment include any portion of the right-of-way within the access control lines as shown on the plans for a Federal-aid project approved by the FHWA, without the prior approval of the Federal Highway Administrator.</P>
              <P>(5) There cannot be additional Federal-aid participation in future construction or reconstruction on any relinquished “off the Federal-aid system” facility unless the underlying reason for such future work is caused by future improvement of the associated Federal-aid highway.</P>
              <P>(g) In the event that a State desires to apply for approval by the Federal Highway Administrator for the relinquishment of a facility such as described in paragraph (d) (1) and (2) of this section, the facts pertinent to such proposal are to be presented to the division engineer of the FHWA. The division engineer shall have appropriate review made of such presentation and forward the material presented by the State together with his findings thereon through the Regional Federal Highway Administrator for consideration by the Federal Highway Administrator and determination of action to be taken.</P>
              <P>(h) No change may be made in control of access, without the joint determination and approval of the SHA and FHWA. This would not prevent the relinquishment of title, without prior approval of the FHWA, of a segment of the right-of-way provided there is an abandonment of a section of highway inclusive of such segment.</P>
              <P>(i) Relinquishments must be justified by the State's finding concurred in by the FHWA, that:</P>
              <P>(1) The subject land will not be needed for Federal-aid highway purposes in the foreseeable future;</P>
              <P>(2) That the right-of-way being retained is adequate under present day standards for the facility involved;</P>
              <P>(3) That the release will not adversely affect the Federal-aid highway facility or the traffic thereon;</P>
              <P>(4) That the lands to be relinquished are not suitable for retention in order to restore, preserve, or improve the scenic beauty adjacent to the highway consonant with the intent of 23 U.S.C. 319 and Pub. L. 89-285, Title III, sections 302-305 (Highway Beautification Act of 1965).</P>
              <P>(j) If a relinquishment is to a Federal, State, or local government agency for highway purposes, there need not be a charge to the said agency, nor in such event any credit to Federal funds. If for any reason there is a charge, the STD may retain the Federal share of the proceeds if used for projects eligible under title 23 of the United States Code.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicable Standards.</E> (1) Design and construction standards for new construction, reconstruction, resurfacing (except for maintenance resurfacing), restoration, or rehabilitation of a highway on the NHS (other than a highway also on the Interstate System or other freeway) shall be those approved by the Secretary in cooperation with the State highway departments. These standards may take into account, in addition to the criteria described in § 625.2(a), the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The constructed and natural environment of the area;</P>
            <P>(ii) The environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, community, and preservation impacts of the activity; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Access for other modes of transportation.</P>
            <P>(2) Federal-aid projects not on the NHS are to be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with State laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design standards, and construction standards.</P>
            <P>(b) The standards, policies, and standard specifications cited in § 625.4 of this part contain specific criteria and controls for the design of NHS projects. Deviations from specific minimum values therein are to be handled in accordance with procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. If there is a conflict between criteria in the documents enumerated in § 625.4 of this part, the latest listed standard, policy, or standard specification will govern.</P>
            <P>(c) Application of FHWA regulations, although cited in § 625.4 of this part as standards, policies, and standard specifications, shall be as set forth therein.</P>
            <P>(d) This regulation establishes Federal standards for work on the NHS regardless of funding source.</P>
            <P>(e) The Division Administrator shall determine the applicability of the roadway geometric design standards to traffic engineering, safety, and preventive maintenance projects which include very minor or no roadway work. Formal findings of applicability are expected only as needed to resolve controversies.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (1) Approval within the delegated authority provided by FHWA Order M1100.1A may be given on a project basis to designs which do not conform to the minimum criteria as set forth in the standards, policies, and standard specifications for:</P>
            <P>(i) Experimental features on projects; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Projects where conditions warrant that exceptions be made.</P>

            <P>(2) The determination to approve a project design that does not conform to the minimum criteria is to be made only after due consideration is given to <PRTPAGE P="236"/>all project conditions such as maximum service and safety benefits for the dollar invested, compatibility with adjacent sections of roadway and the probable time before reconstruction of the section due to increased traffic demands or changed conditions.</P>

            <P>(3) Any major project (as defined in 23 U.S.C. 106(h)), located on or off of the NHS, that utilizes Federal-aid highway funding in any contract or phase comprising the major project;</P>
            <P>(4) Any project where a VE analysis has not been conducted and a change is made to the project's scope or design between the final design and the construction letting which results in an increase in the project's total cost exceeding the thresholds identified in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(5) Any other project FHWA determines to be appropriate that utilizes Federal-aid highway program funding.</P>
            <P>(c) An additional VE analysis is not required if, after conducting a VE analysis required under this part, the project is subsequently split into smaller projects in the design phase or the project is programmed to be completed by the letting of multiple construction projects. However, the STA may not avoid the requirement to conduct a VE analysis on an applicable project by splitting the project into smaller projects, or programming multiple design or construction projects.</P>
            <P>(d) The STA's VE Program's policies and procedures should identify when VE analyses are to be considered or conducted for projects falling below the required thresholds identified in paragraph (b) of this section in the planning and development of transportation projects where there is a high potential for the project to benefit from a VE analysis. While not required, FHWA encourages STAs to consider the following projects that may benefit from a VE analysis:</P>
            <P>(1) Complex projects on or off the NHS that have a total project cost of $25 million or more;</P>
            <P>(2) Complex Bridge Projects on or off the NHS with an estimated total project cost of $20 million or more;</P>

            <SUBJECT>VE programs.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The STA shall establish and sustain a VE program under which VE analyses are identified, conducted and approved VE recommendations implemented on all applicable projects (as <PRTPAGE P="240"/>defined in § 627.5). The STA's VE program shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Establish and document VE program policies and procedures that ensure the required VE analysis is conducted on all applicable projects, and encourage conducting VE analyses on other projects that have the potential to benefit from this analysis;</P>
            <P>(2) Ensure the VE analysis is conducted and all approved recommendations are implemented and documented in a final VE report prior to the project being authorized to proceed to a construction letting;</P>
            <P>(3) Monitor and assess the VE Program, and disseminate an annual report to the FHWA consisting of a summary of all approved recommendations implemented on applicable projects requiring a VE analysis, the accepted VECPs, and VE program functions and activities;</P>
            <P>(4) Establish and document policies, procedures, and contract provisions that identify when VECP's may be used; identify the analysis, documentation, basis, and process for evaluating and accepting a VECP; and determine how the net savings of each VECP may be shared between the agency and contractor;</P>
            <P>(5) Establish and document policies, procedures, and controls to ensure a VE analysis is conducted and all approved recommendations are implemented for all applicable projects administered by local public agencies; and ensure the results of these analyses are included in the VE program monitoring and reporting; and</P>
            <P>(6) Provide for the review of any project where a delay occurs between when the final plans are completed and the project advances to a letting for construction to determine if a change has occurred to the project's scope or design where a VE analysis would be required to be conducted (as specified in § 625.5(b)).</P>
            <P>(b) STAs shall ensure the required VE analysis has been performed on each applicable project including those administered by subrecipients, and shall ensure approved recommendations are implemented into the project's plans, specifications, and estimates prior to the project being authorized for construction (as specified in 23 CFR 630.205).</P>
            <P>(c) STAs shall designate a VE Program Coordinator to promote and advance VE program activities and functions. The VE Coordinator's responsibilities should include establishing and maintaining the STA's VE policies and procedures; facilitating VE training; ensuring VE analyses are conducted on applicable projects; monitoring, assessing, and reporting on the VE analyses conducted and VE program; participating in periodic VE program and project reviews; submitting the required annual VE report to the FHWA; and supporting the other elements of the VE program.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 627.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Conducting a VE analysis.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A VE analysis should be conducted as early as practicable in the planning or development of a project, preferably before the completion of the project's preliminary design. At a minimum, the VE analysis shall be conducted prior to completing the project's final design.</P>
            <P>(b) The VE analysis should be closely coordinated with other project development activities to minimize the impact approved recommendations might have on previous agency, community, or environmental commitments; the project's scope or schedule; and the use of innovative technologies, materials, methods, plans or construction provisions.</P>
            <P>(c) When the STA or local public agency chooses to conduct a VE analysis for a project utilizing the design-build project delivery method, the VE analysis should be performed prior to the release of the final Request for Proposals or other applicable solicitation documents.</P>
            <P>(d) For projects delivered using the CM/GC contracting method, a VE analysis is not required prior to the preparation and release of the RFP for the CM/GC contract. The VE analysis is required to be completed and approved recommendations incorporated into the project plans prior to requesting a construction price proposal from the CM/GC contractor.</P>

            <P>(e) STAs shall ensure the VE analysis meets the following requirements:<PRTPAGE P="241"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Uses a multidisciplinary team not directly involved in the planning or design of the project, with at least one individual who has training and experience with leading VE analyses;</P>
            <P>(2) Develops and implements the VE Job Plan;</P>
            <P>(3) Produces a formal written report outlining, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(i) Project information;</P>
            <P>(ii) Identification of the VE analysis team;</P>
            <P>(iii) Background and supporting documentation, such as information obtained from other analyses conducted on the project (e.g., environmental, safety, traffic operations, constructability);</P>
            <P>(iv) Documentation of the stages of the VE Job Plan which would include documentation of the life-cycle costs that were analyzed;</P>
            <P>(v) Summarization of the analysis conducted;</P>
            <P>(vi) Documentation of the proposed recommendations and approvals received at the time the report is finalized; and</P>
            <P>(vii) The formal written report shall be retained for at least 3 years after the completion of the project.</P>
            <P>(f) For bridge projects, in addition to the requirements in subsection (e), the VE analyses shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Include bridge substructure and superstructure requirements that consider alternative construction materials; and</P>
            <P>(2) Be conducted based on:</P>
            <P>(i) An engineering and economic assessment, taking into consideration acceptable designs for bridges; and</P>
            <P>(ii) An analysis of life-cycle costs and duration of project construction.</P>
            <P>(g) STAs and local public agencies may employ qualified consultants (as defined in 23 CFR 172.3) to conduct a VE analysis. The consultant shall possess training and experience with leading VE analyses. A consulting firm or individual shall not be used to conduct or support a VE analysis if they have a conflict of interest (as specified in 23 CFR 1.33).</P>
            <P>(h) STAs, and local public agencies are encouraged to use a VECP clause (or other such clauses under a different name) in an applicable project's contract, allowing the construction contractor to propose changes to the project's plans, specifications, or other contract documents. Whenever such clauses are used, the STA and local authority will consider changes that could improve the project's performance, value and quality, shorten the delivery time, or lower construction costs, while considering impacts on the project's overall life-cycle cost and other applicable factors. The basis for a STA or local authority to consider a VECP is the analysis and documentation supporting the proposed benefits that would result from implementing the proposed change in the project's contract or project plans.</P>
            <P>(i) Proposals to accelerate construction after the award of the contract will not be considered a VECP and will not be eligible for Federal-aid highway program funding participation. Where it is necessary to accelerate construction, STAs and local public agencies are encouraged to use the appropriate incentive or disincentive clauses so that all proposers will take this into account when preparing their bids or price proposals.</P>

              <P>(a) This subpart is applicable to all Federal-aid projects unless specifically exempted.</P>
              <P>(b) Other projects which involve special procedures are to be approved, or authorized as set out in the implementing instructions or regulations for those projects.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Authorization to proceed.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The State transportation department (STD) must obtain an authorization to proceed from the FHWA before beginning work on any Federal-aid project. The STD may request an authorization to proceed in writing or by electronic mail for a project or a group of projects.</P>
              <P>(2) The FHWA will issue the authorization to proceed either through or after the execution of a formal project agreement with the State. The agreement can be executed only after applicable prerequisite requirements of Federal laws and implementing regulations and directives are satisfied. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, the FHWA will obligate Federal funds in the project or group of projects upon execution of the project agreement.</P>
              <P>(3) The State's request that Federal funds be obligated shall be supported by a documented cost estimate that is based on the State's best estimate of costs.</P>
              <P>(4) The State shall maintain a process to adjust project cost estimates. For example, the process would require a review of the project cost estimate when the bid is approved, a project phase is completed, a design change is approved, etc. Specifically, the State shall revise the Federal funds obligated within 90 days after it has determined that the estimated Federal share of project costs has decreased by $250,000 or more.</P>

              <P>(5) The State shall review, on a quarterly basis, inactive projects (for the purposes of this subpart an “inactive project” means a project for which no expenditures have been charged against Federal funds for the past 12 months) with unexpended Federal obligations <PRTPAGE P="243"/>and shall revise the Federal funds obligated for a project within 90 days to reflect the current cost estimate, based on the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Projects inactive for the past 12 months with unexpended balances more than $500,000,</P>
              <P>(ii) Projects inactive for the past 24 months with unexpended balances of $50,000 to $500,000, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Projects inactive for the past 36 months with unexpended balances less than $50,000.</P>
              <P>(6) If the State fails to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), or (5) of this section, then the FHWA shall revise the obligations or take such other action as authorized by 23 CFR 1.36. The FHWA shall advise the State of its proposed actions and provide the State with the opportunity to respond before actions are taken. The FHWA shall not adjust obligations without a State's consent during the August redistribution process, August 1 to September 30.</P>
              <P>(7) For design-build projects, the execution or modification of the project agreement for final design and physical construction, and authorization to proceed, shall not occur until after the completion of the NEPA process. However, preliminary design (as defined in 23 CFR 636.103) and preliminary engineering may be authorized in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(8) For Construction Manager/General Contractor projects, the execution or modification of the project agreement for preconstruction services associated with final design and for construction services, and authorization to proceed with such services, shall not occur until after the completion of the NEPA process. However, preconstruction services associated with preliminary design may be authorized in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Federal funds shall not participate in costs incurred prior to the date of a project agreement except as provided by 23 CFR 1.9(b).</P>
              <P>(c) The execution of the project agreement shall be deemed a contractual obligation of the Federal government under 23 U.S.C. 106 and shall require that appropriate funds be available at the time of authorization for the agreed Federal share, either pro rata or lump sum, of the cost of eligible work to be incurred by the State except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Advance construction projects authorized under 23 U.S.C. 115.</P>
              <P>(2) Projects for preliminary studies for the portion of the preliminary engineering and right-of-way (ROW) phase(s) through the selection of a location.</P>
              <P>(3) Projects for ROW acquisition in hardship and protective buying situations through the selection of a particular location. This includes ROW acquisition within a potential highway corridor under consideration where necessary to preserve the corridor for future highway purposes. Authorization of work under this paragraph shall be in accord with the provisions of 23 CFR part 710.</P>
              <P>(4) In special cases where the Federal Highway Administrator determines it to be in the best interest of the Federal-aid highway program.</P>
              <P>(d) For projects authorized to proceed under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, the executed project agreement shall contain the following statement: “Authorization to proceed is not a commitment or obligation to provide Federal funds for that portion of the undertaking not fully funded herein.”</P>
              <P>(e) For projects authorized under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, subsequent authorizations beyond the location stage shall not be given until appropriate available funds have been obligated to cover eligible costs of the work covered by the previous authorization.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) The Federal-aid share of eligible project costs shall be established at the time the project agreement is executed in one of the following manners:</P>
              <P>(i) Pro rata, with the agreement stating the Federal share as a specified percentage; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Lump sum, with the agreement stating that Federal funds are limited to a specified dollar amount not to exceed the legal pro rata.</P>

              <P>(2) The pro-rata or lump sum share may be adjusted before or shortly after contract award to reflect any substantive change in the bids received as compared to the STD's estimated cost <PRTPAGE P="244"/>of the project at the time of FHWA authorization, provided that Federal funds are available.</P>
              <P>(3) Federal participation is limited to the agreed Federal share of eligible costs actually incurred by the State, not to exceed the maximum permitted by enabling legislation.</P>
              <P>(g) The State may contribute more than the normal non-Federal share of title 23, U.S.C. projects. In general, financing proposals that result in only minimal amounts of Federal funds in projects should be avoided unless they are based on sound project management decisions.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Donations of cash, land, material or services may be credited to the State's non-Federal share of the participating project work in accordance with title 23, U.S.C., and implementing regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) Contributions may not exceed the total costs incurred by the State on the project. Cash contributions from all sources plus the Federal funds may not exceed the total cost of the project.</P>

              <P>(a) Highway purposes may best be served by the establishment of station markings for horizontal control along Federal-aid highway routes at spacings of three to eight kilometers (about 2 to 5 miles) and station markers for vertical control of spacings no closer than one kilometer. These requirements may be waived only with the approval of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) Projects should be of sufficient scope to permit efficient use of field parties. Projects should extend at least 30 kilometers. Projects may be coordinated with adjoining States to attain greater efficiency.</P>
              <P>(c) Where geodetic station markers cannot be established inititally at points readily accessible from the Federal-aid route, or where unavoidable circumstances result in their being established within construction limits, supplemental projects may later be approved to set and survey markers at satisfactory permanent points, preferably within the right-of-way but at points where their use does not introduce traffic hazards.</P>

              <P>Work zones directly impact the safety and mobility of road users and highway workers. These safety and mobility impacts are exacerbated by an aging highway infrastructure and growing congestion in many locations. Addressing these safety and mobility issues requires considerations that start early in project development and continue through project completion. Part 6 of the Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> sets forth basic principles and prescribes standards for the design, application, installation, and maintenance of traffic control devices for highway and street construction, maintenance operation, and utility work. In addition to the provisions in the MUTCD, there are other actions that could be taken to further help mitigate the safety and mobility impacts of work zones. This subpart establishes requirements and provides guidance for systematically addressing the safety and mobility impacts of work zones, and developing strategies to help manage these impacts on all Federal-aid highway projects.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Highway workers</E> include, but are not limited to, personnel of the contractor, subcontractor, DOT, utilities, and law enforcement, performing work within the right-of-way of a transportation facility.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Mobility</E> is the ability to move from place to place and is significantly dependent on the availability of transportation facilities and on system operating conditions. With specific reference to work zones, mobility pertains to moving road users efficiently through or around a work zone area with a minimum delay compared to baseline travel when no work zone is present, while not compromising the safety of highway workers or road users. The commonly used performance measures for the assessment of mobility include delay, speed, travel time and queue lengths.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Safety</E> is a representation of the level of exposure to potential hazards for users of transportation facilities and highway workers. With specific reference to work zones, safety refers to minimizing potential hazards to road users in the vicinity of a work zone and highway workers at the work zone interface with traffic. The commonly used measures for highway safety are the number of crashes or the consequences of crashes (fatalities and injuries) at a given location or along a section of highway during a period of time. Highway worker safety in work zones refers to the safety of workers at the work zone interface with traffic and the impacts of the work zone design on worker safety. The number of worker fatalities and injuries at a given location or along a section of highway, during a period of time are commonly used measures for highway worker safety.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Work zone</E> <SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> is an area of a highway with construction, maintenance, or utility work activities. A work zone is typically marked by signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, and/or work vehicles. It extends from the first warning sign or high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the END ROAD WORK sign or the last temporary traffic control (TTC) device.</P>

                <E T="03">Work zone crash</E> <SU>3</SU>

                <FTREF/> means a traffic crash in which the first harmful event <PRTPAGE P="249"/>occurs within the boundaries of a work zone or on an approach to or exit from a work zone, resulting from an activity, behavior, or control related to the movement of the traffic units through the work zone. This includes crashes occurring on approach to, exiting from or adjacent to work zones that are related to the work zone.</P>

                <E T="03">Work zone impacts</E> refer to work zone-induced deviations from the normal range of transportation system safety and mobility. The extent of the work zone impacts may vary based on factors such as, road classification, area type (urban, suburban, and rural), traffic and travel characteristics, type of work being performed, time of day/night, and complexity of the project. These impacts may extend beyond the physical location of the work zone itself, and may occur on the roadway on which the work is being performed, as well as other highway corridors, other modes of transportation, and/or the regional transportation network.</P>

              <P>Each State shall implement a policy for the systematic consideration and management of work zone impacts on all Federal-aid highway projects. This policy shall address work zone impacts throughout the various stages of the project development and implementation process. This policy may take the form of processes, procedures, and/or guidance, and may vary based on the characteristics and expected work zone impacts of individual projects or classes of projects. The States should institute this policy using a multi-disciplinary team and in partnership with the FHWA. The States are encouraged to implement this policy for non-Federal-aid projects as well.</P>

              <P>(a) This section consists of State-level processes and procedures for States to implement and sustain their respective work zone safety and mobility policies. State-level processes and procedures, data and information resources, training, and periodic evaluation enable a systematic approach for addressing and managing the safety and mobility impacts of work zones.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Work zone assessment and management procedures.</E> States should develop and implement systematic procedures to assess work zone impacts in project development, and to manage safety and mobility during project implementation. The scope of these procedures shall be based on the project characteristics.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Work zone data.</E> States shall use field observations, available work zone crash data, and operational information to manage work zone impacts for specific projects during implementation. States shall continually pursue improvement of work zone safety and mobility by analyzing work zone crash and operational data from multiple projects to improve State processes and procedures. States should maintain elements of the data and information resources that are necessary to support these activities.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Training.</E> States shall require that personnel involved in the development, design, implementation, operation, inspection, and enforcement of work zone related transportation management and traffic control be trained, appropriate to the job decisions each individual is required to make. States shall require periodic training updates that reflect changing industry practices and State processes and procedures.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Process review.</E> In order to assess the effectiveness of work zone safety and mobility procedures, the States shall perform a process review at least every two years. This review may include the evaluation of work zone data at the State level, and/or review of randomly selected projects throughout their jurisdictions. Appropriate personnel who represent the project development stages and the different offices within the State, and the FHWA should participate in this review. Other non-State stakeholders may also be included in this review, as appropriate. The results of the review are intended to lead to improvements in work zone <PRTPAGE P="250"/>processes and procedures, data and information resources, and training programs so as to enhance efforts to address safety and mobility on current and future projects.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Significant projects.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A significant project is one that, alone or in combination with other concurrent projects nearby is anticipated to cause sustained work zone impacts (as defined in § 630.1004) that are greater than what is considered tolerable based on State policy and/or engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(b) The applicability of the provisions in §§ 630.1012(b)(2) and 630.1012(b)(3) is dependent upon whether a project is determined to be significant. The State shall identify upcoming projects that are expected to be significant. This identification of significant projects should be done as early as possible in the project delivery and development process, and in cooperation with the FHWA. The State's work zone policy provisions, the project's characteristics, and the magnitude and extent of the anticipated work zone impacts should be considered when determining if a project is significant or not.</P>
              <P>(c) All Interstate system projects within the boundaries of a designated Transportation Management Area (TMA) that occupy a location for more than three days with either intermittent or continuous lane closures shall be considered as significant projects.</P>
              <P>(d) For an Interstate system project or categories of Interstate system projects that are classified as significant through the application of the provisions in § 630.1010(c), but in the judgment of the State they do not cause sustained work zone impacts, the State may request from the FHWA, an exception to §§ 630.1012(b)(2) and 630.1012(b)(3). Exceptions to these provisions may be granted by the FHWA based on the State's ability to show that the specific Interstate system project or categories of Interstate system projects do not have sustained work zone impacts.</P>

              <P>(a) This section provides guidance and establishes procedures for States to manage the work zone impacts of individual projects.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transportation Management Plan (TMP).</E> A TMP consists of strategies to manage the work zone impacts of a project. Its scope, content, and degree of detail may vary based upon the State's work zone policy, and the State's understanding of the expected work zone impacts of the project. For significant projects (as defined in § 630.1010), the State shall develop a TMP that consists of a Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) plan and addresses both Transportation Operations (TO) and Public Information (PI) components. For individual projects or classes of projects that the State determines to have less than significant work zone impacts, the TMP may consist only of a TTC plan. States are encouraged to consider TO and PI issues for all projects.</P>

              <P>(1) A TTC plan describes TTC measures to be used for facilitating road users through a work zone or an incident area. The TTC plan plays a vital role in providing continuity of reasonably safe and efficient road user flow and highway worker safety when a work zone, incident, or other event temporarily disrupts normal road user flow. The TTC plan shall be consistent with the provisions under Part 6 of the MUTCD and with the work zone hardware recommendations in Chapter 9 of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Roadside Design Guide. Chapter 9 of the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide: “Traffic Barriers, Traffic Control Devices, and Other Safety Features for Work Zones” 2002, is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 and is on file at the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA call (202) 741-6030, or go to <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</E> The entire document is available for purchase from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), 444 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 249, Washington, DC 20001 or <PRTPAGE P="251"/>at the URL: <E T="03">http://www.aashto.org/bookstore.</E> It is available for inspection from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all Division Offices as listed in 49 CFR part 7. In developing and implementing the TTC plan, pre-existing roadside safety hardware shall be maintained at an equivalent or better level than existed prior to project implementation. The scope of the TTC plan is determined by the project characteristics, and the traffic safety and control requirements identified by the State for that project. The TTC plan shall either be a reference to specific TTC elements in the MUTCD, approved standard TTC plans, State transportation department TTC manual, or be designed specifically for the project.</P>
              <P>(2) The TO component of the TMP shall include the identification of strategies that will be used to mitigate impacts of the work zone on the operation and management of the transportation system within the work zone impact area. Typical TO strategies may include, but are not limited to, demand management, corridor/network management, safety management and enforcement, and work zone traffic management. The scope of the TO component should be determined by the project characteristics, and the transportation operations and safety strategies identified by the State.</P>
              <P>(3) The PI component of the TMP shall include communications strategies that seek to inform affected road users, the general public, area residences and businesses, and appropriate public entities about the project, the expected work zone impacts, and the changing conditions on the project. This may include traveler information strategies. The scope of the PI component should be determined by the project characteristics and the public information and outreach strategies identified by the State. Public information should be provided through methods best suited for the project, and may include, but not be limited to, information on the project characteristics, expected impacts, closure details, and commuter alternatives.</P>
              <P>(4) States should develop and implement the TMP in sustained consultation with stakeholders (e.g., other transportation agencies, railroad agencies/operators, transit providers, freight movers, utility suppliers, police, fire, emergency medical services, schools, business communities, and regional transportation management centers).</P>
              <P>(c) The Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&amp;Es) shall include either a TMP or provisions for contractors to develop a TMP at the most appropriate project phase as applicable to the State's chosen contracting methodology for the project. A contractor developed TMP shall be subject to the approval of the State, and shall not be implemented before it is approved by the State.</P>
              <P>(d) The PS&amp;Es shall include appropriate pay item provisions for implementing the TMP, either through method or performance based specifications.</P>
              <P>(1) For method-based specifications individual pay items, lump sum payment, or a combination thereof may be used.</P>
              <P>(2) For performance based specifications, applicable performance criteria and standards may be used (e.g., safety performance criteria such as number of crashes within the work zone; mobility performance criteria such as travel time through the work zone, delay, queue length, traffic volume; incident response and clearance criteria; work duration criteria).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Responsible persons.</E> The State and the contractor shall each designate a trained person, as specified in § 630.1008(d), at the project level who has the primary responsibility and sufficient authority for implementing the TMP and other safety and mobility aspects of the project.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy and procedures for work zone safety management.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each agency's policy and processes, procedures, and/or guidance for the systematic consideration and management of work zone impacts, to be <PRTPAGE P="253"/>established in accordance with 23 CFR 630.1006, shall include the consideration and management of road user and worker safety on Federal-aid highway projects. These processes, procedures, and/or guidance, to be developed in partnership with the FHWA, shall address the use of Positive Protection Devices to prevent the intrusion of motorized traffic into the work space and other potentially hazardous areas in the work zone; Exposure Control Measures to avoid or minimize worker exposure to motorized traffic and road user exposure to work activities; Other Traffic Control Measures including uniformed law enforcement officers to minimize work zone crashes; and the safe entry/exit of work vehicles onto/from the travel lanes. Each of these strategies should be used to the extent that they are possible, practical, and adequate to manage work zone exposure and reduce the risks of crashes resulting in fatalities or injuries to workers and road users.</P>
              <P>(b) Agency processes, procedures, and/or guidance should be based on consideration of standards and/or guidance contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide, as well as project characteristics and factors. The strategies and devices to be used may be determined by a project-specific engineering study, or determined from agency guidelines that define strategies and approaches to be used based on project and highway characteristics and factors. The types of measures and strategies to be used are not mutually exclusive, and should be considered in combination as appropriate based on characteristics and factors such as those listed below:</P>
              <P>(1) Project scope and duration;</P>
              <P>(2) Anticipated traffic speeds through the work zone;</P>
              <P>(3) Anticipated traffic volume;</P>
              <P>(4) Vehicle mix;</P>
              <P>(5) Type of work (as related to worker exposure and crash risks);</P>
              <P>(6) Distance between traffic and workers, and extent of worker exposure;</P>
              <P>(7) Escape paths available for workers to avoid a vehicle intrusion into the work space;</P>
              <P>(8) Time of day (e.g., night work);</P>
              <P>(9) Work area restrictions (including impact on worker exposure);</P>
              <P>(10) Consequences from/to road users resulting from roadway departure;</P>
              <P>(11) Potential hazard to workers and road users presented by device itself and during device placement and removal;</P>
              <P>(12) Geometrics that may increase crash risks (e.g., poor sight distance, sharp curves);</P>
              <P>(13) Access to/from work space;</P>
              <P>(14) Roadway classification; and</P>
              <P>(15) Impacts on project cost and duration.</P>
              <P>(c) Uniformed Law Enforcement Policy. Each agency, in partnership with the FHWA, shall develop a policy addressing the use of uniformed law enforcement on Federal-aid highway projects. The policy may consist of processes, procedures, and/or guidance. The processes, procedures, and/or guidance should address the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Basic interagency agreements between the highway agency and appropriate law enforcement agencies to address work zone enforcement needs;</P>
              <P>(2) Interaction between highway and law-enforcement agency during project planning and development;</P>
              <P>(3) Conditions where law enforcement involvement in work zone traffic control may be needed or beneficial, and criteria to determine the project-specific need for law enforcement;</P>
              <P>(4) General nature of law enforcement services to be provided, and procedures to determine project-specific services;</P>
              <P>(5) Appropriate work zone safety and mobility training for the officers, consistent with the training requirements in 23 CFR 630.1008(d);</P>
              <P>(6) Procedures for interagency and project-level communications between highway agency and law enforcement personnel; and</P>
              <P>(7) Reimbursement agreements for law enforcement service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Work zone safety management measures and strategies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Positive Protection Devices.</E> The need for longitudinal traffic barrier and other positive protection devices shall be based on an engineering study. The engineering study may be used to develop positive protection guidelines <PRTPAGE P="254"/>for the agency, or to determine the measures to be applied on an individual project. The engineering study should be based on consideration of the factors and characteristics described in section 630.1106(b). At a minimum, positive protection devices shall be considered in work zone situations that place workers at increased risk from motorized traffic, and where positive protection devices offer the highest potential for increased safety for workers and road users, such as:</P>
              <P>(1) Work zones that provide workers no means of escape from motorized traffic (e.g., tunnels, bridges, etc.);</P>
              <P>(2) Long duration work zones (e.g., two weeks or more) resulting in substantial worker exposure to motorized traffic;</P>
              <P>(3) Projects with high anticipated operating speeds (e.g., 45 mph or greater), especially when combined with high traffic volumes;</P>
              <P>(4) Work operations that place workers close to travel lanes open to traffic; and</P>
              <P>(5) Roadside hazards, such as drop-offs or unfinished bridge decks, that will remain in place overnight or longer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exposure Control Measures.</E> Exposure Control Measures should be considered where appropriate to avoid or minimize worker exposure to motorized traffic and exposure of road users to work activities, while also providing adequate consideration to the potential impacts on mobility. A wide range of measures may be appropriate for use on individual projects, such as:</P>
              <P>(1) Full road closures;</P>
              <P>(2) Ramp closures;</P>
              <P>(3) Median crossovers;</P>
              <P>(4) Full or partial detours or diversions;</P>
              <P>(5) Protection of work zone setup and removal operations using rolling road blocks;</P>
              <P>(6) Performing work at night or during off-peak periods when traffic volumes are lower; and</P>
              <P>(7) Accelerated construction techniques.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other Traffic Control Measures.</E> Other Traffic Control Measures should be given appropriate consideration for use in work zones to reduce work zone crashes and risks and consequences of motorized traffic intrusion into the work space. These measures, which are not mutually exclusive and should be considered in combination as appropriate, include a wide range of other traffic control measures such as:</P>
              <P>(1) Effective, credible signing;</P>
              <P>(2) Changeable message signs;</P>
              <P>(3) Arrow panels;</P>
              <P>(4) Warning flags and lights on signs;</P>
              <P>(5) Longitudinal and lateral buffer space;</P>
              <P>(6) Trained flaggers and spotters;</P>
              <P>(7) Enhanced flagger station setups;</P>
              <P>(8) Intrusion alarms;</P>
              <P>(9) Rumble strips;</P>
              <P>(10) Pace or pilot vehicle;</P>
              <P>(11) High quality work zone pavement markings and removal of misleading markings;</P>
              <P>(12) Channelizing device spacing reduction;</P>
              <P>(13) Longitudinal channelizing barricades;</P>
              <P>(14) Work zone speed management (including changes to the regulatory speed and/or variable speed limits);</P>
              <P>(15) Law enforcement;</P>
              <P>(16) Automated speed enforcement (where permitted by State/local laws);</P>
              <P>(17) Drone radar;</P>
              <P>(18) Worker and work vehicle/equipment visibility;</P>
              <P>(19) Worker training;</P>
              <P>(20) Public information and traveler information; and</P>
              <P>(21) Temporary traffic signals.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers.</E> (1) A number of conditions may indicate the need for or benefit of uniformed law enforcement in work zones. The presence of a uniformed law enforcement officer and marked law enforcement vehicle in view of motorized traffic on a highway project can affect driver behavior, helping to maintain appropriate speeds and improve driver alertness through the work zone. However, such law enforcement presence is not a substitute for the temporary traffic control devices required by Part 6 of the MUTCD. In general, the need for law enforcement is greatest on projects with high traffic speeds and volumes, and where the work zone is expected to result in substantial disruption to or changes in normal traffic flow patterns. Specific project conditions should be examined to determine <PRTPAGE P="255"/>the need for or potential benefit of law enforcement, such as the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Frequent worker presence adjacent to high-speed traffic without positive protection devices;</P>
              <P>(ii) Traffic control setup or removal that presents significant risks to workers and road users;</P>
              <P>(iii) Complex or very short term changes in traffic patterns with significant potential for road user confusion or worker risk from traffic exposure;</P>
              <P>(iv) Night work operations that create substantial traffic safety risks for workers and road users;</P>
              <P>(v) Existing traffic conditions and crash histories that indicate a potential for substantial safety and congestion impacts related to the work zone activity, and that may be mitigated by improved driver behavior and awareness of the work zone;</P>
              <P>(vi) Work zone operations that require brief stoppage of all traffic in one or both directions;</P>
              <P>(vii) High-speed roadways where unexpected or sudden traffic queuing is anticipated, especially if the queue forms a considerable distance in advance of the work zone or immediately adjacent to the work space; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Other work site conditions where traffic presents a high risk for workers and road users, such that the risk may be reduced by improving road user behavior and awareness.</P>
              <P>(2) Costs associated with the provision of uniformed law enforcement to help protect workers and road users, and to maintain safe and efficient travel through highway work zones, are eligible for Federal-aid participation. Federal-aid eligibility excludes law enforcement activities that would normally be expected in and around highway problem areas requiring routine or ongoing law enforcement traffic control and enforcement activities. Payment for the services of uniformed law enforcement in work zones may be included in the construction contract, or be provided by direct reimbursement from the highway agency to the law enforcement agency. When payment is included through the construction contract, the contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the law enforcement agency, and in turn will recover those costs through contract pay items. Direct interagency reimbursement may be made on a project-specific basis, or on a program-wide basis that considers the overall level of services to be provided by the law enforcement agency. Contract pay items for law enforcement service may be either unit price or lump sum items. Unit price items should be utilized when the highway agency can estimate and control the quantity of law enforcement services required on the project. The use of lump sum payment should be limited to situations where the quantity of services is directly affected by the contractor's choice of project scheduling and chosen manner of staging and performing the work. Innovative payment items may also be considered when they offer an advantage to both the highway agency and the contractor. When reimbursement to the law enforcement agency is made by interagency transfer of funds, the highway agency should establish a program-level or project-level budget that is adequate to meet anticipated program or project needs, and include provisions to address unplanned needs and other contingencies.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Work Vehicles and Equipment.</E> In addition to addressing risks to workers and road users from motorized traffic, the agency processes, procedures, and/or guidance established in accordance with 23 CFR 630.1006 should also address safe means for work vehicles and equipment to enter and exit traffic lanes and for delivery of construction materials to the work space, based on individual project characteristics and factors.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Payment for Traffic Control.</E> Consistent with the requirements of 23 CFR 630.1012, Project-level Procedures, project plans, specifications and estimates (PS&amp;Es) shall include appropriate pay item provisions for implementing the project Transportation Management Plan (TMP), which includes a Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) plan, either through method or performance based specifications. Pay item provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Payment for work zone traffic control features and operations shall not be incidental to the contract, or included in payment for other items of <PRTPAGE P="256"/>work not related to traffic control and safety;</P>
              <P>(2) As a minimum, separate pay items shall be provided for major categories of traffic control devices, safety features, and work zone safety activities, including but not limited to positive protection devices, and uniformed law enforcement activities when funded through the project;</P>
              <P>(3) For method based specifications, the specifications and other PS&amp;E documents should provide sufficient details such that the quantity and types of devices and the overall effort required to implement and maintain the TMP can be determined;</P>
              <P>(4) For method-based specifications, unit price pay items, lump sum pay items, or a combination thereof may be used;</P>
              <P>(5) Lump sum payment should be limited to items for which an estimate of the actual quantity required is provided in the PS&amp;E or for items where the actual quantity required is dependent upon the contractor's choice of work scheduling and methodology;</P>
              <P>(6) For Lump Sum items, a contingency provision should be included such that additional payment is provided if the quantity or nature of the required work changes, either an increase or decrease, due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor;</P>
              <P>(7) Unit price payment should be provided for those items over which the contractor has little or no control over the quantity, and no firm estimate of quantities is provided in the PS&amp;Es, but over which the highway agency has control of the actual quantity to be required during the project;</P>
              <P>(8) Specifications should clearly indicate how placement, movement/relocation, and maintenance of traffic control devices and safety features will be compensated; and</P>
              <P>(9) The specifications should include provisions to require and enforce contractor compliance with the contract provisions relative to implementation and maintenance of the project TMP and related traffic control items. Enforcement provisions may include remedies such as liquidated damages, work suspensions, or withholding payment for noncompliance.</P>

              <P>4. <E T="03">Information and reports.</E> The contractor shall provide all information and reports required by the Regulations, or directives issued pursuant thereto, and shall permit access to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined by the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration to be pertinent to ascertain compliance with such Regulations, orders and instructions.

              <P>5. <E T="03">Sanctions for noncompliance.</E> In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this contract, the State highway department shall impose such contract sanctions as it or the Federal Highway Administration may determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to:</P>

              </FP>
              
              <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3), the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part thereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this clause, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of section VI, paragraph 3b, hereof. Also for the purpose of this clause, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Classifications</E>—a. The State highway department contracting officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified conformably to the wage determination, and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the State highway department contracting officer to the Secretary of Labor.</P>
              <P>b. In the event the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the State highway department contracting officer shall be referred to the Secretary for final determination.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Payment of fringe benefits</E>—a. The State highway department contracting officer shall require, whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof to be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefits, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the contracting officer, shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination.</P>

              <P>b. If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wage of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is part of this contract: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Payment of excess wages.</E> While the wage rates shown are the minimum rates required by the contract to be paid during its life, this is not a representation that labor can be obtained at these rates. No increase in the contract price shall be allowed or authorized on account of the payment of wage rates in excess of those listed herein.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Labor).</E> a. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they performed when they are employed and individually <PRTPAGE P="264"/>registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Bureau, or if a person is employed in his first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, who is not individually registered in the program, but who has been certified by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not a trainee as defined in 29 CFR 5.2(c)(2) or is not registered or otherwise employed as stated above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the State highway department or to a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as the appropriate ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman hourly rates), for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work. The wage rate paid apprentices shall be not less than the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination.</P>
              <P>b. Trainees, except as provided in 29 CFR 5.15, will not be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal certification, by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The ratio of trainees to journeymen shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for his level of progress. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall be paid not less than the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish the State highway department or a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the certification of his program, the registration of the trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in that program. In the event the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training withdraws approval of a training program, the contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.</P>
              <P>c. The utilization of apprentices, trainees and journeymen shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 29 CFR part 30.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Transportation).</E> Apprentices and trainees working under apprenticeship and skill training programs which have been certified by the Secretary of Transportation as promoting equal opportunity in connection with Federal-aid highway construction programs are not subject to the requirements of section VI, paragraph 5 above. The straight time hourly wage rates for apprentices and trainees under such programs will be established by the particular programs.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Withholding for unpaid wages.</E> The State highway department contracting officer may withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers, mechanics, (including apprentices and trainees) watchmen, or guards employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by the contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer, mechanic, (including apprentices and trainees) watchman or guard employed or working on the site of the work, all or part of the wages required by the contract, the State highway department contracting officer may, after written notice to the contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Overtime requirements.</E> a. No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, watchmen or guards (including apprentices and trainees described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above) shall require or permit any laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard in any workweek in which he is employed on such work, to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be.</P>

              <P>b. In the event of any violation of paragraph 8a, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefor shall be liable to any affected employee for his unpaid wages. <PRTPAGE P="265"/>In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed with respect to each individual laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard employed in violation of paragraph 8a, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by paragraph 8a.</P>

              <P>c. The State highway department contracting officer may withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for liquidated damages as provided in paragraph 8b.

Payrolls and basic records relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers, mechanics, apprentices, trainees, watchmen and guards working at the site of the work.</P>
              <P>b.

Whenever the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section VI, paragraph 3.b., has found that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section I(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Method of construction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Actual construction work shall be performed by contract awarded by competitive bidding; unless, as provided in § 635.104(b), the STD demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division Administrator that some other method is more cost effective or that an emergency exists. The STD shall assure opportunity for free, open, and competitive bidding, including adequate publicity of the advertisements or calls for bids. The advertising or calling for bids and the award of contracts shall comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in §§ 635.112 and 635.114.</P>
              <P>(b) Approval by the Division Administrator for construction by a method other than competitive bidding shall be requested by the State in accordance with subpart B of part 635 of this chapter. Before such finding is made, the STD shall determine that the organization to undertake the work is so staffed and equipped as to perform such work satisfactorily and cost effectively.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Supervising agency.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The STD has responsibility for the construction of all Federal-aid projects, and is not relieved of such responsibility by authorizing performance of the work by a local public agency or other Federal agency. The STD shall be responsible for insuring that such projects receive adequate supervision and inspection to insure that projects are completed in conformance with approved plans and specifications.</P>
              <P>(b) Although the STD may employ a consultant to provide construction engineering services, such as inspection or survey work on a project, the STD shall provide a full-time employed State engineer to be in responsible charge of the project.</P>

              <P>(c) When a project is located on a street or highway over which the STD does not have legal jurisdiction, or when special conditions warrant, the <PRTPAGE P="273"/>STD, while not relieved of overall project responsibility, may arrange for the local public agency having jurisdiction over such street or highway to perform the work with its own forces or by contract; provided the following conditions are met and the Division Administrator approves the arrangements in advance.</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of force account work, there is full compliance with subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) When the work is to be performed under a contract awarded by a local public agency, all Federal requirements including those prescribed in this subpart shall be met.</P>
              <P>(3) The local public agency is adequately staffed and suitably equipped to undertake and satisfactorily complete the work; and</P>
              <P>(4) In those instances where a local public agency elects to use consultants for construction engineering services, the local public agency shall provide a full-time employee of the agency to be in responsible charge of the project.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of publicly owned equipment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Publicly owned equipment should not normally compete with privately owned equipment on a project to be let to contract. There may be exceptional cases, however, in which the use of equipment of the State or local public agency for highway construction purposes may be warranted or justified. A proposal by any STD for the use of publicly owned equipment on such a project must be supported by a showing that it would clearly be cost effective to do so under the conditions peculiar to the individual project or locality.</P>
              <P>(b) Where publicly owned equipment is to be made available in connection with construction work to be let to contract, Federal funds may participate in the cost of such work provided the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The proposed use of such equipment is clearly set forth in the Plans, Specifications and Estimate (PS&amp;E) submitted to the Division Administrator for approval.</P>
              <P>(2) The advertised specifications specify the items of publicly owned equipment available for use by the successful bidder, the rates to be charged, and the points of availability or delivery of the equipment; and</P>
              <P>(3) The advertised specifications include a notification that the successful bidder has the option either of renting part or all of such equipment from the State or local public agency or otherwise providing the equipment necessary for the performance of the contract work.</P>
              <P>(c) In the rental of publicly owned equipment to contractors, the State or local public agency shall not profit at the expense of Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(d) Unforeseeable conditions may make it necessary to provide publicly owned equipment to the contractor at rental rates agreed to between the contractor and the State or local public agency after the work has started. Any such arrangement shall not form the basis for any increase in the cost of the project on which Federal funds are to participate.</P>
              <P>(e) When publicly owned equipment is used on projects constructed on a force account basis, costs may be determined by agreed unit prices or on an actual cost basis. When agreed unit prices are applied the equipment need not be itemized nor rental rates shown in the estimate. However, if such work is to be performed on an actual cost basis, the STD shall submit to the Division Administrator for approval the scheduie of rates proposed to be charged, exclusive of profit, for the publicly owned equipment made available for use.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Participation by disadvantaged business enterprises.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The STD shall schedule contract lettings in a balanced program providing contracts of such size and character as to assure an opportunity for all sizes of contracting organizations to compete. In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, subsequent Federal-aid Highway Acts, and 49 CFR part 26, the STD shall ensure equal opportunity for disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) participating in the Federal-aid highway program.</P>

              <P>(b) In the case of a design-build or CM/GC project funded with title 23 funds, the requirements of 49 CFR part <PRTPAGE P="274"/>26 and the State's approved DBE plan apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standardized changed condition clauses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following changed conditions contract clauses shall be made part of, and incorporated in, each highway construction project, including construction services contracts of CM/GC projects, approved under 23 U.S.C. 106:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Differing site conditions.</E> (i) During the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the site differing materially from those indicated in the contract or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the contract, are encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before the site is disturbed and before the affected work is performed.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon written notification, the engineer will investigate the conditions, and if it is determined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the contract, an adjustment, excluding anticipated profits, will be made and the contract modified in writing accordingly. The engineer will notify the contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.</P>
              <P>(iii) No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the contractor will be allowed unless the contractor has provided the required written notice.</P>
              <P>(iv) No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for any effects caused on unchanged work. (This provision may be omitted by the STD's at their option.)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Suspensions of work ordered by the engineer.</E> (i) If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction industry) and the contractor believes that additional compensation and/or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay, the contractor shall submit to the engineer in writing a request for adjustment within 7 calendar days of receipt of the notice to resume work. The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon receipt, the engineer will evaluate the contractor's request. If the engineer agrees that the cost and/or time required for the performance of the contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the contractor, its suppliers, or subcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by weather, the engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the contract in writing accordingly. The contractor will be notified of the engineer's determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.</P>
              <P>(iii) No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the contractor has submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed.</P>

              <P>(iv) No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.<PRTPAGE P="275"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Significant changes in the character of work.</E> (i) The engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the work, such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the surety, and the contractor agrees to perform the work as altered.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under the contract, whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other work cause such other work to become significantly different in character, an adjustment, excluding anticipated profit, will be made to the contract. The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If a basis cannot be agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either for or against the contractor in such amount as the engineer may determine to be fair and equitable.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the contract, the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the contract.</P>
              <P>(iv) The term “significant change” shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(A) When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction; or</P>
              <P>(B) When a major item of work, as defined elsewhere in the contract, is increased in excess of 125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the original contract quantity. Any allowance for an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 percent of original contract item quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75 percent, to the actual amount of work performed.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this section shall be governed by the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Where State statute does not permit one or more of the contract clauses included in paragraph (a) of this section, the State statute shall prevail and such clause or clauses need not be made applicable to Federal-aid highway contracts.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the State transportation department has developed and implemented one or more of the contract clauses included in paragraph (a) of this section, such clause or clauses, as developed by the State transportation department may be included in Federal-aid highway contracts in lieu of the corresponding clause or clauses in paragraph (a) of this section. The State's action must be pursuant to a specific State statute requiring differing contract conditions clauses. Such State developed clause or clauses, however, must be in conformance with 23 U.S.C., 23 CFR and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations as appropriate and shall be subject to the Division Administrator's approval as part of the PS&amp;E.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of a design-build project, STDs are strongly encouraged to use “suspensions of work ordered by the engineer” clauses, and may consider “differing site condition” clauses and “significant changes in the character of work” clauses which are appropriate for the risk and responsibilities that are shared with the design-builder.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Licensing and qualification of contractors.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The procedures and requirements a STD proposes to use for qualifying and licensing contractors, who may bid for, be awarded, or perform Federal-aid highway contracts, shall be submitted to the Division Administrator for advance approval. Only those procedures and requirements so approved shall be effective with respect to Federal-aid highway projects. Any changes in approved procedures and requirements shall likewise be subject to approval by the Division Administrator.</P>

              <P>(b) No procedure or requirement for bonding, insurance, prequalification, qualification, or licensing of contractors shall be approved which, in the <PRTPAGE P="276"/>judgment of the Division Administrator, may operate to restrict competition, to prevent submission of a bid by, or to prohibit the consideration of a bid submitted by, any responsible contractor, whether resident or nonresident of the State wherein the work is to be performed.</P>
              <P>(c) No contractor shall be required by law, regulation, or practice to obtain a license before submission of a bid or before the bid may be considered for award of a contract. This, however, is not intended to preclude requirements for the licensing of a contractor upon or subsequent to the award of the contract if such requirements are consistent with competitive bidding. Prequalification of contractors may be required as a condition for submission of a bid or award of contract only if the period between the date of issuing a call for bids and the date of opening of bids affords sufficient time to enable a bidder to obtain the required prequalification rating.</P>
              <P>(d) Requirements for the prequalification, qualification or licensing of contractors, that operate to govern the amount of work that may be bid upon by, or may be awarded to, a contractor, shall be approved only if based upon a full and appropriate evaluation of the contractor's capability to perform the work.</P>
              <P>(e) Contractors who are currently suspended, debarred or voluntarily excluded under 49 CFR part 29 or otherwise determined to be ineligible, shall be prohibited from participating in the Federal-aid highway program.</P>
              <P>(f) In the case of design-build and CM/GC projects, the STDs may use their own bonding, insurance, licensing, qualification or prequalification procedure for any phase of procurement.</P>
              <P>(1) The STDs may not impose statutory or administrative requirements which provide an in-State or local geographical preference in the solicitation, licensing, qualification, pre-qualification, short listing or selection process. The geographic location of a firm's office may not be one of the selection criteria. However, the STDs may require the successful design-builder to establish a local office after the award of contract.</P>
              <P>(2) If required by State statute, local statute, or administrative policy, the STDs may require prequalification for construction contractors. The STDs may require offerors to demonstrate the ability of their engineering staff to become licensed in that State as a condition of responsiveness; however, licensing procedures may not serve as a barrier for the consideration of otherwise responsive proposals. The STDs may require compliance with appropriate State or local licensing practices as a condition of contract award.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tied bids.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The STD may tie or permit the tying of Federal-aid highway projects or Federal-aid and State-financed highway projects for bidding purposes where it appears that by so doing more favorable bids may be received. To avoid discrimination against contractors desiring to bid upon a lesser amount of work than that included in the tied combinations, provisions should be made to permit bidding separately on the individual projects whenever they are of such character as to be suitable for bidding independently.</P>
              <P>(b) When Federal-aid and State-financed highway projects are tied or permitted to be tied together for bidding purposes, the bid schedule shall set forth the quantities separately for the Federal-aid work and the State-financed work. All proposals submitted for the tied projects must contain separate bid prices for each project individually. Federal participation in the cost of the work shall be on the basis of the lowest overall responsive bid proposal unless the analysis of bids reveals that mathematical unbalancing has caused an unsupported shift of cost liability to the Federal-aid work. If such a finding is made, Federal participation shall be based on the unit prices represented in the proposal by the individual contractor who would be the lowest responsive and responsible bidder if only the Federal-aid project were considered.</P>

              <P>(c) Federal-aid highway projects and State-financed highway projects may <PRTPAGE P="277"/>be combined in one contract if the conditions of the projects are so similar that the unit costs on the Federal-aid projects should not be increased by such combinations of projects. In such cases, like quantities should be combined in the proposal to avoid the possibility of unbalancing of bids in favor of either of the projects in the combination.</P>

              <P>(c) The STD shall obtain the approval of the Division Administrator prior to issuing any addenda which contain a major change to the approved plans or specifications during the advertising period. Minor addenda need not receive prior approval but should be identified by the STD at the time of or prior to requesting FHWA concurrence in award. The STD shall provide assurance that all bidders have received all issued addenda.</P>
              <P>(d) Nondiscriminatory bidding procedures shall be afforded to all qualified bidders regardless of National, State or local boundaries and without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. If any provisions of State laws, specifications, regulations, or policies may operate in any manner contrary to Federal requirements, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to prevent submission of a bid, or prohibit consideration of a bid submitted by any responsible bidder appropriately qualified in accordance with § 635.110, such provisions shall not be applicable to Federal-aid projects. Where such nonapplicable provisions exist, notices of advertising, specifications, special provisions or other governing documents shall include a positive statement to advise prospective bidders of those provisions that are not applicable.</P>
              <P>(e) Except in the case of a concession agreement, as defined in section 710.703 of this title, no public agency shall be permitted to bid in competition or to enter into subcontracts with private contractors.</P>

              <P>(f) The STD shall include a noncollusion provision substantially as follows in the bidding documents:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>Each bidder shall file a statement executed by, or on behalf of the person, firm, association, or corporation submitting the bid certifying that such person, firm, association, or corporation has not, either directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any collusion, or otherwise taken any action, in restraint of free competitive bidding in connection with the submitted bid. Failure to submit the executed statement as part of the bidding documents will make the bid nonresponsive and not eligible for award consideration.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(1) The required form for the statement will be provided by the State to each prospective bidder.</P>
              <P>(2) The statement shall either be in the form of an affidavit executed and sworn to by the bidder before a person who is authorized by the laws of the State to administer oaths or in the form of an unsworn declaration executed under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States.</P>
              <P>(g) The STD shall include the lobbying certification requirement pursuant to 49 CFR part 20 and the requirements of 49 CFR part 29 regarding suspension and debarment certification in the bidding documents.</P>
              <P>(h) The STD shall clearly identify in the bidding documents those requirements which the bidder must assure are complied with to make the bid responsive. Failure to comply with these identified bidding requirements shall make the bid nonresponsive and not eligible for award consideration.</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of a design-build project, the following requirements apply:</P>

              <P>(1) When a Request for Proposals document is issued after the NEPA process is complete, the FHWA Division Administrator's approval of the Request for Proposals document will constitute the FHWA's project authorization and <PRTPAGE P="278"/>the FHWA's approval of the STD's request to release the document. This approval will carry the same significance as plan, specification and estimate approval on a design-bid-build Federal-aid project.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a Request for Proposals document is issued prior to the completion of the NEPA process, the FHWA's approval of the document will only constitute the FHWA's approval of the STD's request to release the document.</P>
              <P>(3) The STD may decide the appropriate solicitation schedule for all design-build requests. This includes all project advertising, the release of the Request for Qualifications document, the release of the Request for Proposals document and all deadlines for the receipt of qualification statements and proposals. Typical advertising periods range from six to ten weeks and can be longer for large, complicated projects.</P>
              <P>(4) The STD must obtain the approval of the Division Administrator prior to issuing addenda which result in major changes to the Request for Proposals document. Minor addenda need not receive prior approval but may be identified by the STD at the time of or prior to requesting the FHWA's concurrence in award. The STD must provide assurance that all offerors have received all issued addenda.</P>
              <P>(j) In the case of a CM/GC project, the FHWA Division Administrator's approval of the solicitation document will constitute the FHWA's approval to use the CM/GC contracting method and approval to release the solicitation document. The STD must obtain the approval of the FHWA Division Administrator before issuing addenda which result in major changes to the solicitation document.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Award of contract and concurrence in award.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Federal-aid contracts shall be awarded only on the basis of the lowest responsive bid submitted by a bidder meeting the criteria of responsibility as may have been established by the STD in accordance with § 635.110. Award shall be within the time established by the STD and subject to the <PRTPAGE P="279"/>prior concurrence of the Division Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) The STD shall formally request concurrence by the Division Administrator in the award of all Federal-aid contracts. Concurrence in award by the Division Administrator is a prerequisite to Federal participation in construction costs and is considered as authority to proceed with construction, unless specifically stated otherwise. Concurrence in award shall be formally approved and shall only be given after receipt and review of the tabulation of bids.</P>
              <P>(c) Following the opening of bids, the STD shall examine the unit bid prices of the apparent low bid for reasonable conformance with the engineer's estimated prices. A bid with extreme variations from the engineer's estimate, or where obvious unbalancing of unit prices has occurred, shall be thoroughly evaluated.</P>
              <P>(d) Where obvious unbalanced bid items exist, the STD's decision to award or reject a bid shall be supported by written justification. A bid found to be mathematically unbalanced, but not found to be materially unbalanced, may be awarded.</P>
              <P>(e) When a low bid is determined to be both mathematically and materially unbalanced, the Division Administrator will take appropriate steps to protect the Federal interest. This action may be concurrence in a STD decision not to award the contract. If, however, the STD decides to proceed with the award and requests FHWA concurrence, the Division Administrator's action may range from nonconcurrence to concurrence with contingency conditions limiting Federal participation.</P>
              <P>(f) If the STD determines that the lowest bid is not responsive or the bidder is not responsible, it shall so notify and obtain the Division Administrator's concurrence before making an award to the next lowest bidder.</P>
              <P>(g) If the STD rejects or declines to read or consider a low bid on the grounds that it is not responsive because of noncompliance with a requirement which was not clearly identified in the bidding documents, it shall submit justification for its action. If such justification is not considered by the Division Administrator to be sufficient, concurrence will not be given to award to another bidder on the contract at the same letting.</P>
              <P>(h) Any proposal by the STD to reject all bids received for a Federal-aid contract shall be submitted to the Division Administrator for concurrence, accompanied by adequate justification.</P>
              <P>(i) In the event the low bidder selected by the STD for contract award forfeits the bid guarantee, the STD may dispose of the amounts of such forfeited guarantees in accordance with its normal practices.</P>
              <P>(j) A copy of the executed contract between the STD and the construction contractor should be furnished to the Division Administrator as soon as practicable after execution.</P>

              <P>(a) Following the award of contract, an agreement estimate based on the contract unit prices and estimated quantities shall be prepared by the STD and submitted to the Division Administrator as soon as practicable for use in the preparation of the project agreement. The agreement estimate shall also include the actual or best estimated costs of any other items to be included in the project agreement.</P>

              <P>(b) An agreement estimate shall be submitted by the STD for each force account project (see 23 CFR part 635, subpart B) when the plans and specifications are submitted to the Division Administrator for approval. It shall normally be based on the estimated quantities and the unit prices agreed upon in advance between the STD and the Division Administrator, whether the work is to be done by the STD or by a local public agency. Such agreed <PRTPAGE P="280"/>unit prices shall constitute a commitment as the basis for Federal participation in the cost of the project. The unit prices shall be based upon the estimated actual cost of performing the work but shall in no case exceed unit prices currently being obtained by competitive bidding on comparable highway construction work in the same general locality. In special cases involving unusual circumstances, the estimate may be based upon the estimated costs for labor, materials, equipment rentals, and supervision to complete the work rather than upon agreed unit prices. This paragraph shall not be applicable to agreement estimates for railroad and utility force account work.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Subcontracting and contractor responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Contracts for projects shall specify the minimum percentage of work that a contractor must perform with its own organization. This percentage shall be not less than 30 percent of the total original contract price excluding any identified specialty items. Specialty items may be performed by subcontract and the amount of any such specialty items so performed may be deducted from the total original contract before computing the amount of work required to be performed by the contractor's own organization. The contract amount upon which the above requirement is computed includes the cost of materials and manufactured products which are to be purchased or produced by the contractor under the contract provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) The STD shall not permit any of the contract work to be performed under a subcontract, unless such arrangement has been authorized by the STD in writing. Prior to authorizing a subcontract, the STD shall assure that each subcontract is evidenced in writing and that it contains all pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime contract. The Division Administrator may permit the STD to satisfy the subcontract assurance requirements by concurrence in a STD process which requires the contractor to certify that each subcontract arrangement will be in the form of a written agreement containing all the requirements and pertinent provisions of the prime contract. Prior to the Division Administrator's concurrence, the STD must demonstrate that it has an acceptable plan for monitoring such certifications.</P>
              <P>(c) To assure that all work (including subcontract work) is performed in accordance with the contract requirements, the contractor shall be required to furnish:</P>
              <P>(1) A competent superintendent or supervisor who is employed by the firm, has full authority to direct performance of the work in accordance with the contract requirements, and is in charge of all construction operations (regardless of who performs the work), and;</P>
              <P>(2) Such other of its own organizational resources (supervision, management, and engineering services) as the STD contracting officer determines are necessary to assure the performance of the contract.</P>
              <P>(d) In the case of a design-build project, the following requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not applicable to design-build contracts;</P>
              <P>(2) At their discretion, the STDs may establish a minimum percentage of work that must be done by the design-builder. For the purpose of this section, the term design-builder may include any firms that are equity participants in the design-builder, their sister and parent companies, and their wholly owned subsidiaries;</P>

              <P>(c) The selection of labor to be employed by the contractor on any Federal-aid project shall be by the contractor without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap and in accordance with 23 CFR part 230, 41 CFR part 60 and Exec.

              <P>(d) Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 140(d), it is permissible for STD's to implement procedures or requirements which will extend preferential employment to Indians living on or near a reservation on eligible projects as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Indian preference shall be applied without regard to tribal affiliation or place of enrollment. In no instance should a contractor be compelled to layoff or terminate a permanent core-crew employee to meet a preference goal.</P>
              <P>(e) Projects eligible for Indian employment preference consideration are projects located on roads within or providing access to an Indian reservation or other Indian lands as defined under the term “Indian Reservation Roads” in 23 U.S.C. 101 and regulations issued thereunder. The terminus of a road “providing access to” is that point at which it intersects with a road functionally classified as a collector or higher classification (outside the reservation boundary) in both urban and rural areas. In the case of an Interstate highway, the terminus is the first interchange outside the reservation.</P>
              <P>(f) The advertisement or call for bids on any contract for the construction of a project located on the Federal-aid system either shall include the minimum wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor to be prevailing on the same type of work on similar construction in the immediate locality or shall provide that such rates are set out in the bidding documents and shall further specify that such rates are a part of the contract covering the project.</P>

Federal funds will participate to the extent that any contract adjustments made are supported, and have a basis in terms of the contract and applicable State law, as fairly construed. Further, the basis for the adjustment and contractor compensation shall be in accord with prevailing principles of public contract law.</P>
              <P>(b) The FHWA shall be made aware by the STD of the details of the claim at an early stage so that coordination of efforts can be satisfactorily accomplished. It is expected that STDs will diligently pursue the satisfactory resolution of claims within a reasonable period of time. Claims arising on exempt non-NHS projects should be processed in accordance with the State's approved Stewardship Plan.</P>
              <P>(c) When requesting Federal participation, the STD shall set forth in writing the legal and contractual basis for the claim, together with the cost data and other facts supporting the award or settlement. Federal-aid participation in such instances shall be supported by a STD audit of the actual costs incurred by the contractor unless waived by the FHWA as unwarranted. Where difficult, complex, or novel legal issues appear in the claim, such that evaluation of legal controversies is critical to consideration of the award or settlement, the STD shall include in its submission a legal opinion from its counsel setting forth the basis for determining the extent of the liability under local law, with a level of detail commensurate with the magnitude and complexity of the issues involved.</P>
              <P>(d) In those cases where the STD receives an adverse decision in an amount more than the STD was able to support prior to the decision or settles a claim in an amount more than the STD can support, the FHWA will participate up to the appropriate Federal matching share, to the extent that it involves a Federal-aid participating portion of the contract, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The FHWA was consulted and concurred in the proposed course of action;</P>
              <P>(2) All appropriate courses of action had been considered; and</P>
              <P>(3) The STD pursued the case diligently and in a professional manner.</P>
              <P>(e) Federal funds will not participate:</P>
              <P>(1) If it has been determined that STD employees, officers, or agents acted with gross negligence, or participated in intentional acts or omissions, fraud, or other acts not consistent with usual State practices in project design, plan preparation, contract administration, or other activities which gave rise to the claim;</P>

              <P>(2) In such cost items as consequential or punitive damages, anticipated profit, or any award or payment of attorney's fees paid by a State to an opposing party in litigation; and<PRTPAGE P="284"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) In tort, inverse condemnation, or other claims erroneously styled as claims “under a contract.”</P>
              <P>(f) Payment of interest associated with a claim will be eligible for participation provided that the payment to the contractor for interest is allowable by State statute or specification and the costs are not a result of delays caused by dilatory action of the State or the contractor. The interest rates must not exceed the rate provided for by the State statute or specification.</P>
              <P>(g) In cases where STD's affirmatively recover compensatory damages through contract claims, cross-claims, or counter claims from contractors, subcontractors, or their agents on projects on which there was Federal-aid participation, the Federal share of such recovery shall be equivalent to the Federal share of the project or projects involved. Such recovery shall be credited to the project or projects from which the claim or claims arose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Termination of contract.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All contracts exceeding $10,000 shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the State, including the manner by which the termination will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.</P>
              <P>(b) The STD prior to termination of a Federal-aid contract shall consult with and receive the concurrence of the Division Administrator. The extent of Federal-aid participation in contract termination costs, including final settlement, will depend upon the merits of the individual case. However, under no circumstances shall Federal funds participate in anticipated profit on work not performed.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, normal Federal-aid plans, specifications, and estimates, advertising, and award procedures are to be followed when a STD awards the contract for completion of a terminated Federal-aid contract.</P>
              <P>(d) When a STD awards the contract for completion of a Federal-aid contract previously terminated for default, the construction amount eligible for Federal participation on the project should not exceed whichever amount is the lesser, either:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount representing the payments made under the original contract plus payments made under the new contract; or</P>
              <P>(2) The amount representing what the cost would have been if the construction had been completed as contemplated by the plans and specifications under the original contract.</P>
              <P>(e) If the surety awards a contract for completion of a defaulted Federal-aid contract or completes it by some other acceptable means, the FHWA will consider the terms of the original contract to be in effect and that the work will be completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications included therein. No further FHWA approval or concurrence action will therefore be needed in connection with any defaulted Federal-aid contract awarded by a surety. Under this procedure, the construction amount eligible for Federal participation on the project should not exceed the amount representing what the cost would have been if the construction had been completed as contemplated by the plans and specifications under the original contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Agreement provisions regarding overruns in contract time.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each State transportation department (STD) shall establish specific liquidated damages rates applicable to projects in that State. The rates may be project-specific or may be in the form of a table or schedule developed for a range of project costs and/or project types. These rates shall, as a minimum, be established to cover the estimated average daily construction engineering (CE) costs associated with the type of work encountered on the project. The amounts shall be assessed <PRTPAGE P="285"/>by means of deductions, for each calendar day or workday overrun in contract time, from payments otherwise due to the contractor for performance in accordance with the contract terms.</P>
              <P>(b) The rates established shall be subject to FHWA approval either on a project-by-project basis, in the case of project-specific rates, or on a periodic basis after initial approval where a rate table or schedule is used. In the latter case, the STD shall periodically review its cost data to ascertain if the rate table/schedule closely approximates, at a minimum, the actual average daily CE costs associated with the type and size of the projects in the State. Where rate schedules or other means are already included in the STD specifications or standard special provisions, verification by the STD that the amounts are adequate shall be submitted to the FHWA for review and approval. After initial approval by the FHWA of the rates, the STD shall review the rates at least every 2 years and provide updated rates, when necessary, for FHWA approval. If updated rates are not warranted, justification of this fact is to be sent to the FHWA for review and acceptance.</P>
              <P>(c) The STD may, with FHWA concurrence, include additional amounts as liquidated damages in each contract to cover other anticipated costs of project related delays or inconveniences to the STD or the public. Costs resulting from winter shutdowns, retaining detours for an extended time, additional demurrage, or similar costs as well as road user delay costs may be included.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the liquidated damages provisions, the STD may also include incentive/disincentive for early completion provisions in the contract. The incentive/disincentive amounts shall be shown separately from the liquidated damages amounts.</P>
              <P>(e) Where there has been an overrun in contract time, the following principles shall apply in determining the cost of a project that is eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement:</P>
              <P>(1) A proportional share, as used in this section, is the ratio of the final contract construction costs eligible for Federal participation to the final total contract construction costs of the project.</P>
              <P>(2) Where CE costs are claimed as a participating item based upon actual expenses incurred or where CE costs are not claimed as a participating item, and where the liquidated damages rates cover only CE expenses, the total CE costs for the project shall be reduced by the assessed liquidated damages amounts prior to figuring any Federal pro rata share payable. If the amount of liquidated damages assessed is more than the actual CE totals for the project, a proportional share of the excess shall be deducted from the federally participating contract construction cost before determining the final Federal share.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the STD is being reimbursed for CE costs on the basis of an approved percentage of the participating construction cost, the total contract construction amount that would be eligible for Federal participation shall be reduced by a proportional share of the total liquidated damages amounts assessed on the project.</P>
              <P>(4) Where liquidated damages include extra anticipated non-CE costs due to contractor caused delays, the amount assessed shall be used to pay for the actual non-CE expenses incurred by the STD, and, if a Federal participating item(s) is involved, to reduce the Federal share payable for that item(s). If the amount assessed is more than the actual expenses incurred by the STD, a proportional share of the excess shall be deducted from the federally participating contract construction cost of the project before the Federal share is figured.</P>

              <P>(f) When provisions for incentive/disincentive for early completion are used in the contract, a proportion of the increased project costs due to any incentive payments to the contractor shall be added to the federally participating contract construction cost before calculating the Federal share. When the disincentive provision is applicable, a proportion of the amount assessed the contractor shall be deducted from the federally participating contract construction cost before the Federal share <PRTPAGE P="286"/>calculation. Proportions are to be calculated in the same manner as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of this subpart:</P>
              <P>(a) A <E T="03">State transportation department</E> is that department, commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the responsibility for highway construction. The term <E T="03">State</E> should be considered equivalent to <E T="03">State transportation department</E> if the context so implies.</P>

              <P>(b) Except as provided for as emergency repair work in § 668.105(i) and in § 635.204(b), the term <E T="03">some other method</E> of construction as used in 23 U.S.C. 112(b) shall mean the <E T="03">force account</E> method of construction as defined herein. In the unlikely event that circumstances are considered to justify a negotiated contract or another unusual method of construction, the policies and procedures prescribed herein for force account work will apply.</P>
              <P>(c) The term <E T="03">force account</E> shall mean the direct performance of highway construction work by a State transportation department, a county, a railroad, or a public utility company by use of labor, equipment, materials, and supplies furnished by them and used under their direct control.</P>
              <P>(d) The term <E T="03">county</E> shall mean any county, township, municipality or other political subdivision that may be empowered to cooperate with the State transportation department in highway matters.</P>
              <P>(e) The term <E T="03">cost effective</E> shall mean the efficient use of labor, equipment, materials and supplies to assure the lowest overall cost.</P>
              <P>(f) For the purpose of this part, an <E T="03">emergency</E> shall be deemed to exist when emergency repair work as provided for in § 668.105(i) is necessary or when a major element or segment of the highway system has failed and the situation is such that competitive bidding is not possible or is impractical because immediate action is necessary to:</P>
              <P>(1) Minimize the extent of the damage,</P>
              <P>(2) Protect remaining facilities, or</P>
              <P>(3) Restore essential travel.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of more cost effective method or an emergency.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Congress has expressly provided that the contract method based on competitive bidding shall be used by a State transportation department or county for performance of highway work financed with the aid of Federal funds unless the State transportation department demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that some other method is more cost effective or that an emergency exists.</P>

              <P>(b) When a State transportation department determines it necessary due to an emergency to undertake a federally financed highway construction project by force account or negotiated contract method, it shall submit a request to the Division Administrator <PRTPAGE P="287"/>identifying and describing the project, the kinds of work to be performed, the method to be used, the estimated costs, the estimated Federal Funds to be provided, and the reason or reasons that an emergency exists.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when a State transportation department desires that highway construction work financed with the aid of Federal funds, other than the kinds of work designated under § 635.205(b), be undertaken by force account, it shall submit a request to the Division Administrator identifying and describing the project and the kind of work to be performed, the estimated costs, the estimated Federal funds to be provided, and the reason or reasons that force account for such project is considered cost effective.</P>
              <P>(d) The Division Administrator shall notify the State transportation department in writing of his/her determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Finding of cost effectiveness.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It may be found cost effective for a State transportation department or county to undertake a federally financed highway construction project by force account when a situation exists in which the rights or resposibilities of the community at large are so affected as to require some special course of action, including situations where there is a lack of bids or the bids received are unreasonable.</P>
              <P>(b) Pursuant to authority in 23 U.S.C. 112(b), it is hereby determined that by reason of the inherent nature of the operations involved, it is cost effective to perform by force account the adjustment of railroad or utility facilities and similar types of facilities owned or operated by a public agency, a railroad, or a utility company provided that the organization is qualified to perform the work in a satisfactory manner. The installation of new facilities shall be undertaken by competitive bidding except as provided in § 635.204(c). Adjustment of railroad facilities shall include minor work on the railroad's operating facilities routinely performed by the railroad with its own forces such as the installation of grade crossing warning devices, crossing surfaces, and minor track and signal work. Adjustment of utility facilities shall include minor work on the utility's existing facilities routinely performed by the utility with its own forces and includes minor installations of new facilities to provide power, minor lighting, telephone, water and similar utility service to a rest area, weigh-station, movable bridge, or other highway appurtenance, provided such installation cannot feasibly be done as incidental to a major installation project such as an extensive highway lighting system.</P>

              <P>Authorization to advertise the physical construction for bids or to proceed with force account construction thereof shall normally be issued as soon as, but not until, all of the following conditions have been met:</P>
              <P>(a) The plans, specifications, and estimates (PS&amp;E) have been approved.</P>
              <P>(b) A statement is received from the State, either separately or combined with the information required by paragraph (c) of this section, that either all right-of-way (ROW) clearance, utility, and railroad work has been completed or that all necessary arrangements have been made for it to be undertaken and completed as required for proper coordination with the physical construction schedules. Where it is determined that the completion of such work in advance of the highway construction is not feasible or practical due to economy, special operational problems or the like, there shall be appropriate notification provided in the bid proposals identifying the ROW clearance, utility, and railroad work which is to be underway concurrently with the highway construction.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as otherwise provided for design-build projects in § 710.309 of this chapter and paragraph (p) of this section, a statement is received from the State certifying that all individuals and families have been relocated to decent, safe, and sanitary housing or that the State has made available to relocatees adequate replacement housing in accordance with the provisions of the 49 CFR part 24 and that one of the following has application:</P>
              <P>(1) All necessary ROW, including control of access rights when pertinent, have been acquired including legal and physical possession. Trial or appeal of cases may be pending in court but legal possession has been obtained. There may be some improvements remaining on the ROW but all occupants have vacated the lands and improvements and the State has physical possession and the right to remove, salvage, or demolish these improvements and enter on all land.</P>
              <P>(2) Although all necessary ROW have not been fully acquired, the right to occupy and to use all ROW required for the proper execution of the project has been acquired. Trial or appeal of some parcels may be pending in court and on other parcels full legal possession has not been obtained but right of entry has been obtained, the occupants of all lands and improvements have vacated and the State has physical possession and right to remove, salvage, or demolish these improvements.</P>
              <P>(3) The acquisition or right of occupancy and use of a few remaining parcels is not complete, but all occupants of the residences on such parcels have had replacement housing made available to them in accordance with 49 CFR 24.204. Under these circumstances, the State may request the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to authorize actions based on a conditional certification as provided in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(i) The State may request approval for the advertisement for bids based on a conditional certification. The FHWA will approve the request unless it finds that it will not be in the public interest to proceed with the bidding before acquisition activities are complete.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State may request approval for physical construction under a contract or through force account work based on a conditional certification. The FHWA will approve the request only if FHWA finds there are exceptional circumstances that make it in the public interest to proceed with construction before acquisition activities are complete.</P>

              <P>(iii) Whenever a conditional certification is used, the State shall ensure that occupants of residences, businesses, farms, or non-profit organizations who have not yet moved from the <PRTPAGE P="289"/>ROW are protected against unnecessary inconvenience and disproportionate injury or any action coercive in nature.</P>
              <P>(iv) When the State requests authorization under a conditional certification to advertise for bids or to proceed with physical construction where acquisition or right of occupancy and use of a few parcels has not been obtained, full explanation and reasons therefor, including identification of each such parcel, will be set forth in the State's request along with a realistic date when physical occupancy and use is anticipated as well as substantiation that such date is realistic. Appropriate notification must be provided in the request for bids, identifying all locations where right of occupancy and use has not been obtained. Prior to the State issuing a notice to proceed with construction to the contractor, the State shall provide an updated notification to FHWA identifying all locations where right of occupancy and use has not been obtained along with a realistic date when physical occupancy and use is anticipated.</P>
              <P>(v) Participation of title 23 funds in construction delay claims resulting from unavailable parcels shall be determined in accordance with § 635.124. The FHWA will determine the extent of title 23 participation in costs related to construction delay claims resulting from unavailable parcels where FHWA determines the State did not follow approved processes and procedures.</P>
              <P>(d) The State transportation department (SDOT), in accordance with 23 CFR 771.111(h), has submitted public hearing transcripts, certifications and reports pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 128.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 635.407</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Use of materials made available by a public agency.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Contracts for highway projects shall require the contractor to furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work and shall permit the contractor to select the sources from which the materials are to be obtained. Exception to this requirement may be made when there is a definite finding by the State transportation department and concurred in by the FHWA Division Administrator, that it is in the public interest to require the contractor to use material furnished by the State transportation department or from sources designated by the State transportation department. In cases such as this, the FHWA does not expect mutual sharing of costs unless the State transportation department receives a related credit from another agency or political subdivision of the State. Where such a credit does accrue to the State transportation department, it shall be applied to the Federal-aid project involved. The designation of a mandatory material source may be permitted based on environmental considerations, provided the environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost. Otherwise, if a State transportation department proposal to designate a material source for mandatory use would result in higher project costs, Federal-aid funds shall not participate in the increase even if the designation would conserve other public funds.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will not preclude the designation in the plans and specifications of sources of local natural materials, such as borrow aggregates, that have been investigated by the State transportation department and found to contain materials meeting specification requirements. The use of materials from such designated sources shall not be mandatory unless there is a finding of public interest as stated in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Federal funds may participate in the cost of specifications materials made available by a public agency when they have been actually incorporated in accepted items of work, or in the cost of such materials meeting the criteria and stockpiled at the locations specified in § 635.114 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) To be eligible for Federal participation in its cost, any material, other than local natural materials, to be purchased by the State transportation department and furnished to the contractor for mandatory use in the project, must have been acquired on the basis of competitive bidding, except when there is a finding of public interest justifying the use of another method of acquisition. The location and unit price at which such material will be available to the contractor must be stated in the special provisions for the benefit of all prospective bidders. The unit cost eligible for Federation participation will be limited to the unit cost of such material to the State transportation department.</P>
              <P>(e) When the State transportation department or another public agency owns or has control over the source of a local natural material the unit price at which such material will be made available to the contractor must be stated in the plans or special provisions. Federal participation will be limited to (1) the cost of the material to the State transportation department or other public agency; or (2) the fair and reasonable value of the material, whichever is less. Special cases may arise that will justify Federal participation on a basis other than that set forth above. Such cases should be fully documented and receive advance approval by the FHWA Division Administrator.</P>
              <P>(f) Costs incurred by the State transportation department or other public agency for acquiring a designated source or the right to take materials from it will not be eligible for Federal participation if the source is not used by the contractor.</P>

              <P>(g) The contract provisions for one or a combination of Federal-aid projects shall not specify a mandatory site for <PRTPAGE P="292"/>the disposal of surplus excavated materials unless there is a finding by the State transportation department with the concurrence of the FHWA Division Administrator that such placement is the most economical except that the designation of a mandatory site may be permitted based on environmental considerations, provided the environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost.</P>

              <P>No requirement shall be imposed and no procedure shall be enforced by any State transportation department in connection with a project which may operate:</P>
              <P>(a) To require the use of or provide a price differential in favor of articles or materials produced within the State, or otherwise to prohibit, restrict or discriminate against the use of articles or materials shipped from or prepared, made or produced in any State, territory or possession of the United States; or</P>
              <P>(b) To prohibit, restrict or otherwise discriminate against the use of articles or materials of foreign origin to any greater extent than is permissible under policies of the Department of Transportation as evidenced by requirements and procedures prescribed by the FHWA Administrator to carry out such policies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Buy America requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this section shall prevail and be given precedence over any requirements of this subpart which are contrary to this section. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to be contrary to the requirements of § 635.409(a) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) No Federal-aid highway construction project is to be authorized for advertisement or otherwise authorized to proceed unless at least one of the following requirements is met:</P>
              <P>(1) The project either: (i) Includes no permanently incorporated steel or iron materials, or (ii) if steel or iron materials are to be used, all manufacturing processes, including application of a coating, for these materials must occur in the United States. Coating includes all processes which protect or enhance the value of the material to which the coating is applied.</P>
              <P>(2) The State has standard contract provisions that require the use of domestic materials and products, including steel and iron materials, to the same or greater extent as the provisions set forth in this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The State elects to include alternate bid provisions for foreign and domestic steel and iron materials which comply with the following requirements. Any procedure for obtaining alternate bids based on furnishing foreign steel and iron materials which is acceptable to the Division Administrator may be used. The contract provisions must (i) require all bidders to submit a bid based on furnishing domestic steel and iron materials, and (ii) clearly state that the contract will be awarded to the bidder who submits the lowest total bid based on furnishing domestic steel and iron materials unless such total bid exceeds the lowest total bid based on furnishing foreign steel and iron materials by more than 25 percent.</P>
              <P>(4) When steel and iron materials are used in a project, the requirements of this section do not prevent a minimal use of foreign steel and iron materials, if the cost of such materials used does not exceed one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent) of the total contract cost or $2,500, whichever is greater. For purposes of this paragraph, the cost is that shown to be the value of the steel and iron products as they are delivered to the project.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) A State may request a waiver of the provisions of this section if;</P>
              <P>(i) The application of those provisions would be inconsistent with the public interest; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Steel and iron materials/products are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities which are of a satisfactory quality.</P>

              <P>(2) A request for waiver, accompanied by supporting information, must be submitted in writing to the Regional Federal Highway Administrator (RFHWA) through the FHWA Division Administrator. A request must be submitted sufficiently in advance of the need for the waiver in order to allow time for proper review and action on <PRTPAGE P="293"/>the request. The RFHWA will have approval authority on the request.</P>
              <P>(3) Requests for waivers may be made for specific projects, or for certain materials or products in specific geographic areas, or for combinations of both, depending on the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(4) The denial of the request by the RFHWA may be appealed by the State to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator), whose action on the request shall be considered administratively final.</P>
              <P>(5) A request for a waiver which involves nationwide public interest or availability issues or more than one FHWA region may be submitted by the RFHWA to the Administrator for action.</P>

              <P>(6) A request for waiver and an appeal from a denial of a request must include facts and justification to support the granting of the waiver. The FHWA response to a request or appeal will be in writing and made available to the public upon request. Any request for a nationwide waiver and FHWA's action on such a request may be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment.</P>
              <P>(7) In determining whether the waivers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be granted, the FHWA will consider all appropriate factors including, but not limited to, cost, administrative burden, and delay that would be imposed if the provision were not waived.</P>
              <P>(d) Standard State and Federal-aid contract procedures may be used to assure compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) Federal funds shall not participate, directly or indirectly, in payment for any premium or royalty on any patented or proprietary material, specification, or process specifically set forth in the plans and specifications for a project, unless:</P>
              <P>(1) Such patented or proprietary item is purchased or obtained through competitive bidding with equally suitable unpatented items; or</P>
              <P>(2) The State transportation department certifies either that such patented or proprietary item is essential for synchronization with existing highway facilities, or that no equally suitable alternate exists; or</P>
              <P>(3) Such patented or proprietary item is used for research or for a distinctive type of construction on relatively short sections of road for experimental purposes.</P>
              <P>(b) When there is available for purchase more than one nonpatented, nonproprietary material, semifinished or finished article or product that will fulfill the requirements for an item of work of a project and these available materials or products are judged to be of satisfactory quality and equally acceptable on the basis of engineering analysis and the anticipated prices for the related item(s) of work are estimated to be approximately the same, the PS&amp;E for the project shall either contain or include by reference the specifications for each such material or product that is considered acceptable for incorporation in the work. If the State transportation department wishes to substitute some other acceptable material or product for the material or product designated by the successful bidder or bid as the lowest alternate, and such substitution results in an increase in costs, there will not be Federal-aid participation in any increase in costs.</P>
              <P>(c) A State transportation department may require a specific material or product when there are other acceptable materials and products, when such specific choice is approved by the Division Administrator as being in the public interest. When the Division Administrator's approval is not obtained, the item will be nonparticipating unless bidding procedures are used that establish the unit price of each acceptable alternative. In this case Federal-aid participation will be based on the lowest price so established.</P>
              <P>(d) Reference in specifications and on plans to single trade name materials will not be approved on Federal-aid contracts.</P>

              <P>(e) In the case of a design-build project, the following requirements apply: Federal funds shall not participate, directly or indirectly, in payment <PRTPAGE P="294"/>for any premium or royalty on any patented or proprietary material, specification, or process specifically set forth in the Request for Proposals document unless the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section are applicable.</P>
              <P>(f) State transportation departments (State DOTs) shall have the autonomy to determine culvert and storm sewer material types to be included in the construction of a project on a Federal-aid highway.</P>

              <SUBJECT>CM/GC Requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A contracting agency may award a two-phase contract to a CM/GC contractor for preconstruction and construction services. The first phase of this contract is the preconstruction services phase. The second phase is the construction services phase. The construction services phase may occur under one contract or under multiple contracts covering portions of the project, including early work packages.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procurement requirements.</E> (1) The contracting agency may procure the CM/GC contract using applicable State or local competitive selection procurement procedures as long as those procedures do not serve as a barrier to free and open competition or conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) Contracting agency procedures may use any of the following solicitation options in procuring a CM/GC contract: Letters of interest, requests for qualifications, interviews, request for proposals or other solicitation procedures provided by applicable State law, regulation or policy. Single-phase or multiple-phase selection procedures may also be used.</P>
              <P>(3) Contracting agency procedures shall require, at a minimum, that a CM/GC contract be advertised through solicitation documents that:</P>
              <P>(i) Clearly define the scope of services being requested;</P>
              <P>(ii) List evaluation factors and significant subfactors and their relative importance in evaluating proposals;</P>
              <P>(iii) List all required deliverables;</P>
              <P>(iv) Identify whether interviews will be conducted before establishing the final rank (however, the contracting agency may reserve the right to make a final determination whether interviews are needed based on responses to the solicitation); and</P>
              <P>(v) Include or reference sample contract form(s).</P>
              <P>(4) If interviews are used in the selection process, the contracting agency must offer the opportunity for an interview to all short listed firms (or firms that submitted responsive proposals, if a short list is not used). Also, if interviews are used, then the contracting agency must not engage in conduct that favors one firm over another and must not disclose a firm's offer to another firm.</P>
              <P>(5) A contracting agency may award a CM/GC contract based on qualifications, experience, best value, or any other combination of factors considered appropriate by the contracting agency and the Division Administrator and which are clearly specified in the solicitation documents.</P>

              <P>(6) In the event that the contracting agency is unwilling or unable to enter into a contract with the CM/GC contractor for the construction services phase of the project (including any early work package), after the concurrence of the Division Administrator, the contracting agency may initiate a new procurement process meeting the requirements of subpart A of this part, or of another approved method for the affected portion of the construction work. If Federal-aid participation is being requested in the cost of construction, the contracting agency must request FHWA's approval before advertising for bids or proposals in accordance with § 635.112 and part 636 of this chapter. When the contracting agency <PRTPAGE P="297"/>makes a decision to initiate a new procurement, the contracting agency may determine that the CM/GC contractor is likely to have a competitive advantage that could adversely affect fair and open competition and not allow the CM/GC contractor to submit competitive bids.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">FHWA approval of CM/GC procedures.</E> (1) The STA must submit its proposed CM/GC procurement procedures to the FHWA Division Administrator for review and approval. Any changes in approved procedures and requirements shall also be subject to approval by the Division Administrator. Other contracting agencies may follow STA approved procedures, or their own procedures if approved by both the STA and FHWA.</P>
              <P>(2) The Division Administrator may approve procedures that conform to the requirements of this subpart and which do not, in the opinion of the Division Administrator, operate to restrict competition. The Division Administrator's approval of CM/GC procurement procedures may not be delegated or assigned to the STA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Subcontracting.</E> Consistent with § 635.116(a), contracts for construction services must specify a minimum percentage of work (no less than 30 percent of the total cost of all construction services performed under the CM/GC contract, excluding specialty work) that a contractor must perform with its own forces. If required by State law, regulation, or administrative policy, the contracting agency may require the CM/GC contractor to competitively let and award subcontracts for construction services to the lowest responsive bidder.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment methods.</E> (1) The method of payment to the CM/GC contractor shall be set forth in the original solicitation documents, contract, and any contract modification or change order thereto. A single contract may contain different payment methods as appropriate for compensation of different elements of work.</P>
              <P>(2) The methods of payment for preconstruction services shall be: Lump sum, cost plus fixed fee, cost per unit of work, specific rates of compensation, or other comparable payment method permitted in State law and regulation. When compensation is based on actual costs, an approved indirect cost rate must be used. The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of payment shall not be used.</P>
              <P>(3) The method of payment for construction services may include any method of payment authorized by State law (including, but not limited to, lump sum, unit price, and target price). The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of payment shall not be used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Relationship to the NEPA process.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In procuring a CM/GC contract before the completion of the NEPA process, the contracting agency may:</P>
              <P>(1) Issue solicitation documents;</P>
              <P>(2) Proceed with the award of a CM/GC contract providing for preconstruction services and an option to enter into a future contract for construction services once the NEPA review process is complete;</P>
              <P>(3) Issue notices to proceed to the CM/GC contractor for preconstruction services, excluding final design-related activities; and</P>
              <P>(4) Issue a notice-to-proceed to a consultant design firm for the preliminary design and any work related to preliminary design of the project to the extent that those actions do not limit any reasonable range of alternatives.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting agency shall not initiate construction activities (even on an at-risk basis) or allow such activities to proceed prior to the completion of the NEPA process. The contracting agency shall not perform or contract for construction services (including early work packages of any kind) prior to the completion of the NEPA process.</P>

              <P>(c) A contracting agency may proceed, solely at the risk and expense of the contracting agency, with design activities at any level of detail, including final design and preconstruction services associated with final design, for a CM/GC project before completion of the NEPA process without affecting subsequent approvals required for the project. However, FHWA shall not authorize final design activities and <PRTPAGE P="298"/>preconstruction services associated with final design, and such activities shall not be eligible for Federal funding as provided in § 635.506(c), until after the completion the NEPA process. A contracting agency may use a CM/GC contractor for preconstruction services associated with at-risk final design only if the contracting agency has a procedure for segregating the costs of the CM/GC contractor's at-risk work from preconstruction services eligible for reimbursement during the NEPA process. If a contracting agency decides to perform at-risk final design, it must notify FHWA of its decision to do so before undertaking such activities.</P>
              <P>(d) The CM/GC contract must include termination provisions in the event the environmental review process does not result in the selection of a build alternative. This termination provision is in addition to the termination for cause or convenience clause required by Appendix II to 2 CFR part 200.</P>
              <P>(e) If the contracting agency expects to use information from the CM/GC contractor in the NEPA review for the project, then the contracting agency is responsible for ensuring its CM/GC contract gives the contracting agency the right to obtain, as needed, technical information on all alternatives analyzed in the NEPA review.</P>
              <P>(f) The CM/GC contract must include appropriate provisions ensuring no commitments are made to any alternative during the NEPA process, and that the comparative merits of all alternatives identified and considered during the NEPA process, including the no-build alternative, will be evaluated and fairly considered.</P>
              <P>(g) The CM/GC contractor must not prepare NEPA documentation or have any decisionmaking responsibility with respect to the NEPA process. However, the CM/GC contractor may be requested to provide information about the project and possible mitigation actions, including constructability information, and its work product may be considered in the NEPA analysis and included in the record.</P>
              <P>(h) Any contract for construction services under a CM/GC contract must include appropriate provisions ensuring that all environmental and mitigation measures identified in the NEPA documentation and committed to in the NEPA determination for the selected alternative will be implemented, excepting only measures the contracting agency expressly describes in the CM/GC contract as excluded because they are the responsibility of others.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Project approvals and authorizations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) Under 23 U.S.C. 106(c), the States may assume certain FHWA responsibilities for project design, plans, specifications, estimates, contract awards, and inspections. Any individual State's assumption of FHWA responsibilities for approvals and determinations for CM/GC projects, as described in this subpart, will be addressed in the State's FHWA/STA Stewardship and Oversight Agreement. The State may not further delegate or assign those responsibilities. If an STA assumes responsibility for an FHWA approval or determination contained in this subpart, the STA will include documentation in the project file sufficient to substantiate its actions and to support any request for authorization of funds. The STA will provide FHWA with the documentation upon request.</P>
              <P>(2) States cannot assume FHWA review or approval responsibilities for §§ 635.504(c) (review and approval of CM/GC procurement procedures) or 635.506(c) (FHWA post-NEPA review of at-risk final design costs for eligibility).</P>

              <P>(3) In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 106(c), States may assume FHWA review or approval responsibilities for §§ 635.504(b)(6) (approval of bidding), 635.504(e)(3) (approval of indirect cost rate), 635.506(b) (approval of preconstruction price and cost/price analysis), 635.506(d)(2) (approval of price estimate for entire project), 635.506(d)(4) (approval of construction price analysis for each construction services contract), and 635.506(e) (approval of preconstruction services and construction services contract awards) for CM/GC projects on the National Highway System, including projects on the Interstate System, and must assume such responsibilities for projects <PRTPAGE P="299"/>off the National Highway System unless the State determines such assumption is not appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Preconstruction services approvals and authorization.</E> (1) If the contracting agency wishes Federal participation in the cost of the CM/GC contractor's preconstruction services, it must request FHWA's authorization of preliminary engineering before incurring such costs, except as provided by section 1440 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, Pub. L. 114-357 (December 1, 2015).</P>
              <P>(2) Before authorizing pre-construction services by the CM/GC contractor, the Division Administrator must review and approve the contracting agency's cost or price analysis for the preconstruction services procurement (including contract modifications). A cost or price analysis is encouraged but not required for procurements less than the simplified acquisition threshold in 2 CFR 200.88. The requirements of this paragraph apply when the contracting agency is requesting Federal assistance in the cost of preconstruction services.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Final design during NEPA process.</E> (1) If the contracting agency proceeds with final design activities, including CM/GC preconstruction services associated with final design activities, at its own expense before the completion of the NEPA process, then those activities for the selected alternative may be eligible for Federal reimbursement after the completion of the NEPA process so long as the Division Administrator finds that the contracting agency's final design-related activities:</P>
              <P>(i) Did not limit the identification and fair evaluation of a reasonable range of alternatives for the proposed project;</P>
              <P>(ii) Did not result in an irrevocable commitment by the contracting agency to the selection of a particular alternative;</P>
              <P>(iii) Did not have an adverse environmental impact; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Are necessary and reasonable and adequately documented.</P>
              <P>(2) If, during the NEPA process, the Division Administrator finds the final design work limits the fair evaluation of alternatives, irrevocably commits the contracting agency to the selection of any alternative, or causes an adverse environmental impact, then the Division Administrator shall require the contracting agency to take any necessary action to ensure the integrity of the NEPA process regardless of whether or not the contracting agency wishes to receive Federal reimbursement for such activities.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Construction services approvals and authorizations.</E> (1) Subject to the requirements in § 635.505, the contracting agency may request Federal participation in the construction services costs associated with a CM/GC construction project, or portion of a project (including an early work package). In such cases, FHWA's construction contracting requirements will apply to all of the CM/GC project's construction contracts if any portion (including an early work package) of the CM/GC project construction is funded with title 23 funds. Any expenses incurred for construction services before FHWA authorization shall not be eligible for reimbursement except as may be determined in accordance with § 1.9 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The Division Administrator must approve the price estimate for construction costs for the entire project before authorization of construction services (including authorization of an early work package).</P>
              <P>(3) The contracting agency must perform a price analysis for any contract (or contract modification) that establishes or revises the scope, schedule or price for the construction of the CM/GC project or a portion of the project (including an early work package). The price analysis must compare the agreed price with the contracting agency's engineer's estimate or an independent cost estimate (if required by the contracting agency). A price analysis is encouraged but not required for procurements less than the simplified acquisition threshold in 2 CFR 200.88.</P>

              <P>(4) The Division Administrator must review and approve the contracting agency's price analysis and agreed price for the construction services of a CM/GC project or a portion of the project (including an early work package) before authorization of construction services.<PRTPAGE P="300"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Where the contracting agency and the CM/GC contractor agree on a price for construction services that is approved under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, FHWA's authorization of construction services will be based on the approved agreed price for the project or portion of the project. The authorization may include authorization of an early work package, including the advanced acquisition of materials consistent with § 635.122 and this subpart. In the event that construction materials are acquired for a CM/GC project but not installed in the CM/GC project, the cost of such material will not be eligible for Federal-aid participation. In accordance with § 635.507 and 2 CFR part 200, FHWA may deny eligibility for part or all of an early work package if such work is not needed for, or used for, the project.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Contract award.</E> The award of a Federal-aid CM/GC contract for preconstruction services and the award of contract(s) for construction services require prior concurrence from the Division Administrator. The concurrence is a prerequisite to authorization of preconstruction and construction services (including authorization for an early work package). Concurrence in the CM/GC contract award for construction services constitutes approval of the agreed price, scope, and schedule for the work under that contract. Where the contracting agency has established a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) contract goal for the CM/GC construction services contract, the initial proposal for CM/GC construction services must include the DBE documentation required by 49 CFR 26.53(b)(2), or it must include a contractually binding commitment to meet the DBE contract goal, with the information required by 49 CFR 26.53(b)(2) provided before the contracting agency awards the contract for construction services. A copy of the executed contract between the contracting agency and the CM/GC contractor, including any contract for construction services, shall be furnished to the Division Administrator as soon as practical after execution. If the contracting agency decides not to proceed with the award of a CM/GC construction services contract, then it must notify the FHWA Division Administrator as provided in § 635.504(b)(6).</P>

              <P>(a) Costs, or prices based on estimated costs, under a CM/GC contract shall be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement only to the extent that costs incurred, or cost estimates included in negotiated prices, are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles (as specified in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E). Contracting agencies must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with procurement actions, including contract modifications, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.323(a) and this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) For preconstruction services, to the extent that actual costs or cost estimates are included in negotiated prices that will be used for cost reimbursement, the costs must comply with the Federal cost principles to be eligible for participation.</P>
              <P>(2) For construction services, the price analysis must confirm the agreed price is reasonable in order to satisfy cost eligibility requirements (see § 635.506(d)(3)). The FHWA will rely on an approved price analysis when authorizing funds for construction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Indirect cost rates.</E> Where preconstruction service payments are based on actual costs the CM/GC contractor must provide an indirect cost rate established in accordance with the Federal cost principles (as specified in 2 CFR part 200 subpart E).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cost certification.</E> (1) If the CM/GC contractor presents an indirect cost rate established in accordance with the Federal cost principles (as specified in 2 CFR part 200 subpart E), it shall include a certification by an official of the CM/GC contractor that all costs are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles.</P>

              <P>(2) An official of the CM/GC contractor shall be an individual executive or financial officer of the CM/GC contractor's organization, at a level no lower than a Vice President or Chief Financial Officer, or equivalent, who has the authority to make representations about the financial information utilized to establish the indirect cost rate proposal submitted.<PRTPAGE P="301"/>

              <SUBJECT>How does the NEPA process relate to the design-build procurement process?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this section is to ensure that there is an objective NEPA process, that public officials and citizens have the necessary environmental impact information for federally funded actions before actions are taken, and that design-build proposers do not assume an unnecessary amount of risk in the event the NEPA process results in a significant change in the proposal, and that the amount payable by the contracting agency to the design-builder does not include significant contingency as the result of risk placed on the design-builder associated with significant changes in the project definition arising out of the NEPA process. Therefore, with respect to the design-build procurement process:</P>
              <P>(a) The contracting agency may:</P>
              <P>(1) Issue an RFQ prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process as long as the RFQ informs proposers of the general status of NEPA review;</P>
              <P>(2) Issue an RFP after the conclusion of the NEPA process;</P>
              <P>(3) Issue an RFP prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process as long as the RFP informs proposers of the general status of the NEPA process and that no commitment will be made as to any alternative under evaluation in the NEPA process, including the no-build alternative;</P>
              <P>(4) Proceed with the award of a design-build contract prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process;</P>
              <P>(5) Issue notice to proceed with preliminary design pursuant to a design-build contract that has been awarded prior to the completion of the NEPA process; and</P>
              <P>(6) Allow a design-builder to proceed with final design and construction for any projects, or portions thereof, for which the NEPA process has been completed.</P>
              <P>(b) If the contracting agency proceeds to award a design-build contract prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process, then:</P>
              <P>(1) The contracting agency may permit the design-builder to proceed with preliminary design;</P>
              <P>(2) The contracting agency may permit any design and engineering activities to be undertaken for the purposes of defining the project alternatives and completing the NEPA alternatives analysis and review process; complying with other related environmental laws and regulations; supporting agency coordination, public involvement, permit applications, or development of mitigation plans; or developing the design of the preferred alternative to a higher level of detail when the lead agencies agree that it is warranted in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(f)(4)(D);</P>
              <P>(3) The design-build contract must include appropriate provisions preventing the design-builder from proceeding with final design activities and physical construction prior to the completion of the NEPA process (contract hold points or another method of issuing multi-step approvals must be used);</P>
              <P>(4) The design-build contract must include appropriate provisions ensuring that no commitments are made to any alternative being evaluated in the NEPA process and that the comparative merits of all alternatives presented in the NEPA document, including the no-build alternative, will be evaluated and fairly considered;</P>

              <P>(5) The design-build contract must include appropriate provisions ensuring that all environmental and mitigation <PRTPAGE P="306"/>measures identified in the NEPA document will be implemented;</P>
              <P>(6) The design-builder must not prepare the NEPA document or have any decisionmaking responsibility with respect to the NEPA process;</P>
              <P>(7) Any consultants who prepare the NEPA document must be selected by and subject to the exclusive direction and control of the contracting agency;</P>
              <P>(8) The design-builder may be requested to provide information about the project and possible mitigation actions, and its work product may be considered in the NEPA analysis and included in the record; and</P>
              <P>(9) The design-build contract must include termination provisions in the event that the no-build alternative is selected.</P>
              <P>(c) The contracting agency must receive prior FHWA concurrence before issuing the RFP, awarding a design-build contract and proceeding with preliminary design work under the design-build contract. Should the contracting agency proceed with any of the activities specified in this section before the completion of the NEPA process (with the exception of preliminary design, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section), the FHWA's concurrence merely constitutes the FHWA approval that any such activities complies with Federal requirements and does not constitute project authorization or obligate Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(d) The FHWA's authorization and obligation of preliminary engineering and other preconstruction funds prior to the completion of the NEPA process is limited to preliminary design and such additional activities as may be necessary to complete the NEPA process. After the completion of the NEPA process, the FHWA may issue an authorization to proceed with final design and construction and obligate Federal funds for such purposes.</P>

              <P>(a) Yes, the use of oral presentations as a substitute for portions of a written proposal can be effective in streamlining the source selection process. Oral presentations may occur at any time in the acquisition process, however, you must comply with the appropriate State procurement integrity standards.</P>
              <P>(b) Oral presentations may substitute for, or augment, written information. You must maintain a record of oral presentations to document what information you relied upon in making the source selection decision. You may decide the appropriate method and level of detail for the record (e.g., videotaping, audio tape recording, written record, contracting agency notes, copies of offeror briefing slides or presentation notes). A copy of the record should be placed in the contract file and may be provided to offerors upon request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is the stipend amount eligible for Federal participation?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Yes, stipends are eligible for Federal-aid participation. Stipends are recommended on large projects where there is substantial opportunity for innovation and the cost of submitting a <PRTPAGE P="307"/>proposal is significant. On such projects, stipends are used to:</P>
              <P>(1) Encourage competition;</P>
              <P>(2) Compensate unsuccessful offerors for a portion of their costs (usually one-third to one-half of the estimated proposal development cost); and</P>
              <P>(3) Ensure that smaller companies are not put at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless prohibited by State law, you may retain the right to use ideas from unsuccessful offerors if they accept stipends. If stipends are used, the RFP should describe the process for distributing the stipend to qualifying offerors. The acceptance of any stipend must be optional on the part of the unsuccessful offeror to the design-build proposal.</P>
              <P>(c) If you intend to incorporate the ideas from unsuccessful offerors into the same contract on which they unsuccessfully submitted a proposal, you must clearly provide notice of your intent to do so in the RFP.</P>

              <P>(b) Risk allocation will vary according to the type of project and location, however, the following factors should be considered:</P>
              <P>(1) Governmental risks, including the potential for delays, modifications, withdrawal, scope changes, or additions that result from multi-level Federal, State, and local participation and sponsorship;</P>
              <P>(2) Regulatory compliance risks, including environmental and third-party issues, such as permitting, railroad, and utility company risks;</P>

              <SUBJECT>May I meet with industry to gather information concerning the appropriate risk allocation strategies?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Yes, information exchange at an early project stage is encouraged if it facilitates your understanding of the capabilities of potential offerors. However, any exchange of information must be consistent with State procurement integrity requirements. Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.</P>
              <P>(b) The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of your requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy your requirements, and enhancing your ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.</P>
              <P>(c) An early exchange of information can identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type, terms and conditions, and acquisition planning schedules. This also includes the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requirements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information; the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions. Some techniques to promote early exchanges of information are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Industry or small business conferences;</P>
              <P>(2) Public hearings;</P>
              <P>(3) Market research;</P>

              <P>(4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors (any meetings that are substantially involved with potential <PRTPAGE P="308"/>contract terms and conditions should include the contracting officer; also see paragraph (e) of this section regarding restrictions on disclosure of information);</P>
              <P>(5) Presolicitation notices;</P>
              <P>(6) Draft RFPs;</P>
              <P>(7) Request for Information (RFI) ;</P>
              <P>(8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences; and</P>
              <P>(9) Site visits.</P>
              <P>(d) RFIs may be used when you do not intend to award a contract, but want to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract. There is no required format for an RFI.</P>
              <P>(e) When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offerors, that information shall be made available to all potential offerors as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a particular offeror in response to that offeror's request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror's confidential business strategy. When a presolicitation or preproposal conference is conducted, materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all potential offerors, upon request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What organizational conflict of interest requirements apply to design-build projects?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) State statutes or policies concerning organizational conflict of interest should be specified or referenced in the design-build RFQ or RFP document as well as any contract for engineering services, inspection or technical support in the administration of the design-build contract. All design-build solicitations should address the following situations as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) Consultants and/or sub-consultants who assist the owner in the preparation of a RFP document will not be allowed to participate as an offeror or join a team submitting a proposal in response to the RFP. However, a contracting agency may determine there is not an organizational conflict of interest for a consultant or sub-consultant where:</P>
              <P>(i) The role of the consultant or sub-consultant was limited to provision of preliminary design, reports, or similar “low-level” documents that will be incorporated into the RFP, and did not include assistance in development of instructions to offerors or evaluation criteria, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Where all documents and reports delivered to the agency by the consultant or sub-consultant are made available to all offerors.</P>
              <P>(2) All solicitations for design-build contracts, including related contracts for inspection, administration or auditing services, must include a provision which:</P>
              <P>(i) Directs offerors attention to this subpart;</P>
              <P>(ii) States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the owner;</P>
              <P>(iii) States the nature of the proposed restraint or restrictions (and duration) upon future contracting activities, if appropriate;</P>
              <P>(iv) Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether or not the terms of any proposed clause and the application of this subpart to the contract are subject to negotiation; and</P>
              <P>(v) Requires offerors to provide information concerning potential organizational conflicts of interest in their proposals. The apparent successful offerors must disclose all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interests which may present an organizational conflict of interest. Such firms must state how their interests, or those of their chief executives, directors, key project personnel, or any proposed consultant, contractor or subcontractor may result, or could be viewed as, an organizational conflict of interest. The information may be in the form of a disclosure statement or a certification.</P>

              <P>(3) Based upon a review of the information submitted, the owner should make a written determination of whether the offeror's interests create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and identify any actions that must be taken to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. The <PRTPAGE P="309"/>owner should award the contract to the apparent successful offeror unless an organizational conflict of interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated.</P>
              <P>(b) The organizational conflict of interest provisions in this subpart provide minimum standards for STDs to identify, mitigate or eliminate apparent or actual organizational conflicts of interest. To the extent that State-developed organizational conflict of interest standards are more stringent than that contained in this subpart, the State standards prevail.</P>
              <P>(c) If the NEPA process has been completed prior to issuing the RFP, the contracting agency may allow a consultant or subconsultant who prepared the NEPA document to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.</P>
              <P>(d) If the NEPA process has not been completed prior to issuing the RFP, the contracting agency may allow a subconsultant to the preparer of the NEPA document to participate as an offeror or join a team submitting a proposal in response to the RFP only if the contracting agency releases such subconsultant from further responsibilities with respect to the preparation of the NEPA document.</P>

              <P>Where the offeror's qualifications are a major factor in the selection of the successful design-builder, team member switching (adding or switching team members) is discouraged after contract award. However, the owner may use its discretion in reviewing team changes or team enhancement requests on a case-by-case basis.

              <SUBJECT>How does this part apply to a project developed under a public-private partnership?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order for a project being developed under a public-private agreement to be eligible for Federal-aid funding (including traditional Federal-aid funds, direct loans, loan guarantees, lines of credit, or some other form of credit assistance), the contracting agency must have awarded the contract to the public-private entity through a competitive process that complies with applicable State and local laws.</P>
              <P>(b) If a contracting agency wishes to utilize traditional Federal-aid funds in a project under a public-private agreement, the applicability of Federal-aid procurement procedures will depend on the nature of the public-private agreement.</P>
              <P>(1) If the public-private agreement establishes price, then all subsequent contracts executed by the developer are considered to be subcontracts and are not subject to Federal-aid procurement requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) If the public-private agreement does not establish price, the developer is considered to be an agent of the owner, and the developer must follow the appropriate Federal-aid procurement requirements (23 CFR part 172 for engineering service contracts, 23 CFR part 635 for construction contracts and the requirements of this part for design-build contracts) for all prime contracts (not subcontracts).</P>

              <P>(c) The STD must ensure such public-private projects comply with all non-procurement requirements of 23 U. S. Code, regardless of the form of the FHWA funding (traditional Federal-aid funding or credit assistance). This includes compliance with all FHWA policies such as environmental and right-of-way requirements and compliance with such construction contracting requirements as Buy America, Davis-<PRTPAGE P="310"/>Bacon minimum wage rate requirements, for federally funded construction or design-build contracts under the public-private agreement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can past performance be used as an evaluation criteria?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Yes, past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. Past performance information may be used as an evaluation criteria in either phase-one or phase-two solicitations. If you elect to use past performance criteria, the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, <PRTPAGE P="311"/>and general trends in contractor's performance may be considered.</P>
              <P>(b) Describe your approach for evaluating past performance in the solicitation, including your policy for evaluating offerors with no relevant performance history. You should provide offerors an opportunity to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the current solicitation.</P>
              <P>(c) If you elect to request past performance information, the solicitation should also authorize offerors to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. You may consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. You may use your discretion in determining the relevance of similar past performance information.</P>
              <P>(d) The evaluation should take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the current acquisition.</P>

              <P>(1) You must evaluate price in every source selection where construction is a significant component of the scope of work. However, where the contracting agency elects to release the final RFP and award the design-build contract before the conclusion of the NEPA process (see § 636.109), then the following requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(i) It is not necessary to evaluate the total contract price;</P>

              <P>(ii) Price must be considered to the extent the contract requires the contracting agency to make any payments <PRTPAGE P="313"/>to the design-builder for any work performed prior to the completion of the NEPA process and the contracting agency wishes to use Federal-aid highway funds for those activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) The evaluation of proposals and award of the contract may be based on qualitative considerations;</P>
              <P>(iv) If the contracting agency wishes to use Federal-aid highway funds for final design and construction, the subsequent approval of final design and construction activities will be contingent upon a finding of price reasonableness by the contracting agency;</P>
              <P>(v) The determination of price reasonableness for any design-build project funded with Federal-aid highway funds shall be based on at least one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(A) Compliance with the applicable procurement requirements for part 172, 635, or 636, where the contractor providing the final design or construction services, or both, is a person or entity other than the design-builder;</P>
              <P>(B) A negotiated price determined on an open-book basis by both the design-builder and contracting agency; or</P>
              <P>(C) An independent estimate by the contracting agency based on the price of similar work;</P>
              <P>(vi) The contracting agency's finding of price reasonableness is subject to FHWA concurrence.</P>
              <P>(2) You must evaluate the quality of the product or service through consideration of one or more non-price evaluation factors. These factors may include (but are not limited to) such criteria as:</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance with solicitation requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) Completion schedule (contractual incentives and disincentives for early completion may be used where appropriate); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Technical solutions.</P>
              <P>(3) At your discretion, you may evaluate past performance, technical experience and management experience (subject to § 636.303(b)).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What issues may be addressed in discussions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In a competitive acquisition, discussions may include bargaining. The term bargaining may include: persuasion, alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 636.502</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Why should I use discussions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>You should use discussions to maximize your ability to obtain the best value, based on the requirements and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Must I notify offerors of my intent to use/not use discussions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes, in competitive acquisitions, the solicitation must notify offerors of your intent. You should either:</P>
              <P>(a) Notify offerors that discussions may or may not be held depending on the quality of the proposals received (except clarifications may be used as described in § 636.401). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint; or</P>
              <P>(b) Notify offerors of your intent to establish a competitive range and hold discussions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>If the solicitation indicated my intent was to award contract without discussions, but circumstances change, may I still hold discussions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes, you may still elect to hold discussions when circumstances dictate, as long as the rationale for doing so is documented in the contract file. Such circumstances might include situations where all proposals received have deficiencies, when fair and reasonable prices are not offered, or when the cost or price offered is not affordable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Must a contracting agency establish a competitive range if it intends to have discussions with offerors?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes, if discussions are held, they must be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. If you wish to hold discussions and do not formally establish a competitive range, then you must hold discussions with all responsive offerors.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 636.506</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What issues must be covered in discussions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Discussions should be tailored to each offeror's proposal. Discussions must cover significant weaknesses, deficiencies, and other aspects of a proposal (such as cost or price, technical approach, past performance, and terms and conditions) that could be altered or explained to enhance materially the proposal's potential for award. You may use your judgment in setting limits for the scope and extent of discussions.</P>
              <P>(b) In situations where the solicitation stated that evaluation credit would be given for technical solutions exceeding any mandatory minimums, you may hold discussions regarding increased performance beyond any mandatory minimums, and you may suggest to offerors that have exceeded any mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design), that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses were removed and the offered price decreased.</P>

              <P>You may not engage in conduct that:</P>
              <P>(a) Favors one offeror over another;</P>
              <P>(b) Reveals an offeror's technical solution, including unique technology, innovative and unique uses of commercial items, or any information that would compromise an offeror's intellectual property to another offeror;</P>
              <P>(c) Reveals an offerors price without that offeror's permission;</P>
              <P>(d) Reveals the names of individuals providing reference information about an offeror's past performance; or</P>
              <P>(e) Knowingly furnish source selection information which could be in violation of State procurement integrity standards.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 636.509</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Can offerors revise their proposals as a result of discussions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Yes, you may request or allow proposal revisions to clarify and document understandings reached during discussions. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror shall be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision.</P>
              <P>(b) You must establish a common cut-off date only for receipt of final proposal revisions. Requests for final proposal revisions shall advise offerors that the final proposal revisions shall be in writing and that the contracting agency intends to make award without obtaining further revisions.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 636.510</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Can the competitive range be further defined once discussions have begun?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes, you may further narrow the competitive range if an offeror originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated offerors being considered for award. That offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. You must provide an offeror excluded from the competitive range with a written determination and notice that proposal revisions will not be considered.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 636.511</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Can there be more than one round of discussions?</SUBJECT>

              <P>Yes, but only at the conclusion of discussions will the offerors be requested to submit a final proposal revision, also called best and final offer (BAFO). Thus, regardless of the length or number of discussions, there will be <PRTPAGE P="317"/>only one request for a revised proposal (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> only one BAFO).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the basis for the source selection decision?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You must base the source selection decision on a comparative assessment of proposals against all selection criteria in the solicitation. While you may use reports and analyses prepared by others, the source selection decision shall represent your independent judgment.</P>
              <P>(b) The source selection decision shall be documented, and the documentation shall include the rationale for any business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on, including benefits associated with additional costs. Although the rationale for the selection decision must be documented, that documentation need not quantify the tradeoffs that led to the decision.</P>

              <P>(a) The provisions of this regulation apply to reimbursement claimed by a State transportation department (STD) for costs incurred under an approved and properly executed transportation department (TD)/utility agreement and for payment of costs incurred under all Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)/utility agreements.</P>
              <P>(b) Procedures on the accommodation of utilities are set forth in 23 CFR part 645, subpart B, Accommodation of Utilities.</P>

              <P>(c) When the lines or facilities to be relocated or adjusted due to highway construction are privately owned, located on the owner's land, devoted exclusively to private use and not directly or indirectly serving the public, the provisions of the FHWA's right-of-way procedures in 23 CFR 710.203, apply. When applicable, under the foregoing conditions, the provisions of this <PRTPAGE P="321"/>regulation may be used as a guide to establish a cost-to-cure.</P>
              <P>(d) The FHWA's reimbursement to the STD will be governed by State law (or State regulation) or the provisions of this regulation, whichever is more restrictive. When State law or regulation differs from this regulation, a determination shall be made by the STD subject to the concurrence of the FHWA as to which standards will govern, and the record documented accordingly, for each relocation encountered.</P>
              <P>(e) For direct Federal projects, all references herein to the STD or TD are inapplicable, and it is intended that the FHWA be considered in the relative position of the STD or TD.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When requested by the STD, Federal funds may participate, subject to the provisions of § 645.103(d) of this part and at the pro rata share applicable, in an amount actually paid by an TD for the costs of utility relocations. Federal funds may participate in safety corrective measures made under the provisions of § 645.107(k) of this part. Federal funds may also participate for relocations necessitated by the actual construction of highway project made under one or more of the following conditions when:</P>
              <P>(1) The STD certifies that the utility has the right of occupancy in its existing location because it holds the fee, an easement, or other real property interest, the damaging or taking of which is compensable in eminent domain,</P>
              <P>(2) The utility occupies privately or publicly owned land, including public road or street right-of-way, and the STD certifies that the payment by the TD is made pursuant to a law authorizing such payment in conformance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 123, and/or</P>
              <P>(3) The utility occupies publicy owned land, including public road and street right-of-way, and is owned by a public agency or political subdivision of the State, and is not required by law or agreement to move at its own expense, and the STD certifies that the TD has the legal authority or obligation to make such payments.</P>
              <P>(b) On projects which the STD has the authority to participate in project costs, Federal funds may not participate in payments made by a political subdivision for relocation of utility facilities, other than those proposed under the provisions of § 645.107(k) of this part, when State law prohibits the STD from making payment for relocation of utility facilities.</P>
              <P>(c) On projects which the STD does not have the authority to participate in project costs, Federal funds may participate in payments made by a political subdivision for relocation of utility facilities necessitated by the actual construction of a highway project when the STD certifies that such payment is based upon the provisions of § 645.107(a) of this part and does not violate the terms of a use and occupancy agreement, or legal contract, between the utility and the TD or for utility safety corrective measures under the provisions of § 645.107(k) of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Federal funds are not eligible to participate in any costs for which the utility contributes or repays the TD, except for utilities owned by the political subdivision on projects which qualify under the provisions of § 645.107(c) of this part in which case the costs of the utility are considered to be costs of the TD.</P>
              <P>(e) The FHWA may deny Federal fund participation in any payments made by a TD for the relocation of utility facilities when such payments do not constitute a suitable basis for Federal fund participation under the provisions of title 23 U.S.C.</P>
              <P>(f) The rights of any public agency or political subdivision of a State under contract, franchise, or other instrument or agreement with the utility, pertaining to the utility's use and occupancy of publicly owned land, including public road and street right-of-way, shall be considered the rights of the STD in the absence of State law to the contrary.</P>

              <P>(g) In lieu of the individual certifications required by § 645.107(a) and (c), the STD may file a statement with the FHWA setting forth the conditions under which the STD will make payments for the relocation of utility facilities. The FHWA may approve Federal fund participation in utility relocations proposed by the STD under the conditions of the statement when the <PRTPAGE P="323"/>FHWA has made an affirmative finding that such statement and conditions form a suitable basis for Federal fund participation under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 123.</P>
              <P>(h) Federal funds may not participate in the cost of relocations of utility facilities made solely for the benefit or convenience of a utility, its contractor, or a highway contractor.</P>
              <P>(i) When the advance installation of new utility facilities crossing or otherwise occupying the proposed right-of-way of a planned highway project is underway, or scheduled to be underway, prior to the time such right-of-way is purchased by or under control of the TD, arrangements should be made for such facilities to be installed in a manner that will meet the requirements of the planned highway project. Federal funds are eligible to participate in the additional cost incurred by the utility that are attributable to, and in accommodation of, the highway project provided such costs are incurred subsequent to authorization of the work by the FHWA. Subject to the other provisions of this regulation, Federal participation may be approved under the foregoing circumstances when it is demonstrated that the action taken is necessary to protect the public interest and the adjustment of the facility is necessary by reason of the actual construction of the highway project.</P>
              <P>(j) Federal funds are eligible to participate in the costs of preliminary engineering and allied services for utilities, the acquisition of replacement right-of-way for utilities, and the physical construction work associated with utility relocations. Such costs must be incurred by or on behalf of a utility after the date the work is included in an approved program and after the FHWA has authorized the STD to proceed in accordance with 23 CFR part 630, subpart A, Federal-Aid Programs Approval and Project Authorization.</P>
              <P>(k) Federal funds may participate in projects solely for the purpose of implementing safety corrective measures to reduce the roadside hazards of utility facilities to the highway user. Safety corrective measures should be developed in accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR 645.209(k).</P>

              <P>(3) An engineering consultant selected by the utility, with the approval of the TD, the contract to be administered by the utility.</P>
              <P>(b) When a utility is not adequately staffed to pursue the necessary preliminary engineering and related work for the utility relocation, Federal funds may participate in the amount paid to engineers, architects, and others for required engineering and allied services provided such amounts are not based on a percentage of the cost of relocation. When Federal participation is requested by the STD in the cost of such services, the utility and its consultant shall agree in writing as to the services to be provided and the fees and arrangements for the services. Federal funds may participate in the cost of such services performed under existing written continuing contracts when it is demonstrated that such work is performed regularly for the utility in its own work and that the costs are reasonable.</P>

              <P>(1) The utility has the right of occupancy in its existing location beause it holds the fee, an easement, or another real property interest, the damaging or taking of which is compensable in eminent domain, or the acquisition is made in the interest of project economy or is necessary to meet the requirements of the highway project, and</P>
              <P>(2) There will be no charge to the project for that portion of the utility's existing right-of-way being transferred to the TD for highway purposes.</P>
              <P>(b) The utility shall determine and make a written valuation of the replacement right-of-way that it acquires in order to justify amounts paid for such right-of-way. This written valuation shall be accomplished prior to negotiation for acquisition.</P>

              <P>(c) Acquisition of replacement right-of-way by the TD on behalf of a utility or acquisition of nonoperating real property from a utility shall be in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and applicable right-of-way procedures in 23 CFR 710.203.</P>
              <P>(d) When the utility has the right-of-occupancy in its existing location because it holds the fee, an easement, or another real property interest, and it is not necessary by reason of the highway construction to adjust or replace the facilities located thereon, the taking of and damage to the utility's real property, including the disposal or removal of such facilities, may be considered a right-of-way transaction in accordance with provisions of the applicable right-of-way procedures in 23 CFR 710.203.</P>

              <P>(a) On Federal-aid and direct Federal projects involving utility relocations, the utility and the TD shall agree in writing on their separate responsibilities for financing and accomplishing the relocation work. When Federal participation is requested, the agreement shall incorporate this regulation by reference and designate the method to be used for performing the work (by contract or force account) and for developing relocation costs. The method proposed by the utility for developing relocation costs must be acceptable to both the TD and the FHWA. The preferred method for the development of relocation costs by a utility is on the basis of actual direct and related indirect costs accumulated in accordance with a work order accounting procedure prescribed by the applicable Federal or State regulatory body.</P>
              <P>(b) When applicable, the written agreement shall specify the terms and amounts of any contribution or repayments made or to be made by the utility to the TD in connection with payments by the TD to the utility under the provisions of § 645.107 of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(c) The agreement shall be supported by plans, specifications when required, and itemized cost estimates of the work agreed upon, including appropriate credits to the project, and shall be sufficiently informative and complete to provide the TD and the FHWA with a clear description of the work required.</P>
              <P>(d) When the relocation involves both work to be done at the TD's expense and work to be done at the expense of the utility, the written agreement shall state the share to be borne by each party.</P>
              <P>(e) In the event there are changes in the scope of work, extra work or major changes in the planned work covered by the approved agreement, plans, and estimates, Federal participation shall be limited to costs covered by a modification of the agreement, a written change, or extra work order approved by the TD and the FHWA.</P>
              <P>(f) When proposed utility relocation and adjustment work on a project for a specific utility company can be clearly defined and the cost can be accurately estimated, the FHWA may approve an agreement between the TD and the utility company for a lump-sum payment without later confirmation by audit of actual costs.</P>

              <P>(g) Except as otherwise provided by § 645.113(h), authorization by the FHWA <PRTPAGE P="325"/>to the STD to proceed with the physical relocation of a utility's facilities may be given after:</P>
              <P>(1) The utility relocation work, or the right-of-way, or physical construction phase of the highway construction work is included in an approved Statewide transportation improvement program,</P>
              <P>(2) The appropriate environmental evaluation and public hearing procedures required by 23 CFR part 771, Environmental Impact and Related Procedures, have been satisfied.</P>
              <P>(3) The FHWA has reviewed and approved the plans, estimates, and proposed or executed agreements for the utility work and is furnished a schedule for accomplishing the work.</P>
              <P>(h) The FHWA may authorize the physical relocation of utility facilities before the requirements of § 645.113(g)(2) are satisfied when the relocation or adjustment of utility facilities meets the requirements of § 645.107(i) of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(i) Whenever the FHWA has authorized right-of-way acquisition under the hardship and protective buying provisions of 23 CFR 710.503, the FHWA may authorize the physical relocation of utility facilities located in whole or in part on such right-of-way.</P>
              <P>(j) When all efforts by the TD and utility fail to bring about written agreement of their separate responsibilities under the provisions of this regulation, the STD shall submit its proposal and a full report of the circumstances to the FHWA. Conditional authorizations for the relocation work to proceed may be given by the FHWA to the STD with the understanding that Federal funds will not be paid for work done by the utility until the STD proposal has been approved by the FHWA.</P>
              <P>(k) The FHWA will consider for approval any special procedure under State law, or appropriate administrative or judicial order, or under blanket master agreements with the utilities, that will fully accomplish all of the foregoing objectives and accelerate the advancement of the construction and completion of projects.</P>

              <P>(a) Part 635, subpart B, of this title, Force Account Construction (justification required for force account work), states that it is cost-effective for certain utility adjustments to be performed by a utility with its own forces and equipment, provided the utility is qualified to perform the work in a satisfactory manner. This cost-effectiveness finding covers minor work on the utility's existing facilities routinely performed by the utility with its own forces. When the utility is not adequately staffed and equipped to perform such work with its own forces and equipment at a time convenient to and in coordination with the associated highway construction, such work may be done by:</P>
              <P>(1) A contract awarded by the TD or utility to the lowest qualified bidder based on appropriate solicitation,</P>
              <P>(2) Inclusion as part of the TD's highway construction contract let by the TD as agreed to by the utility,</P>
              <P>(3) An existing continuing contract, provided the costs are reasonable, or</P>
              <P>(4) A contract for low-cost incidental work, such as tree trimming and the like, awarded by the TD or utility without competitive bidding, provided the costs are reasonable.</P>
              <P>(b) When it has been determined under part 635, subpart B, that the force account method is not the most cost-effective means for accomplishing the utility adjustment, such work is to be done under competitive bid contracts as described in § 645.115(a) (1) and (2) or under an existing continuing contract provided it can be demonstrated this is the most cost-effective method.</P>
              <P>(c) Costs for labor, materials, equipment, and other services furnished by the utility shall be billed by the utility directly to the TD. The special provisions of contracts let by the utility or the TD shall be explicit in this respect. The costs of force account work performed for the utility by the TD and of contract work performed for the utility under a contract let by the TD shall be reported separately from the costs of other force account and contract items on the highway project.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cost development and reimbursement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Developing and recording costs.</E> (1) All utility relocation costs shall be recorded by means of work orders in accordance with an approved work order system except when another method of developing and recording costs, such as lump-sum agreement, has been approved by the TD and the FHWA. Except for work done under contracts, the individual and total costs properly reported and recorded in the utility's accounts in accordance with the approved method for developing such costs, or the lump-sum agreement, shall constitute the maximum amount on which Federal participation may be based.</P>
              <P>(2) Each utility shall keep its work order system or other approved accounting procedure in such a manner as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement from a facility, the total costs thereof, and the source or sources of cost. Separate work orders may be issued for additions and retirements. Retirements, however, may be included with the construction work order provided that all items relating to retirements shall be kept separately from those relating to construction.</P>
              <P>(3) The STD may develop, or work in concert with utility companies to develop, other acceptable costing methods, such as unit costs, to estimate and reimburse utility relocation expenditures. Such other methods shall be founded in generally accepted industry practices and be reasonably supported by recent actual expenditures. Unit costs should be developed periodically and supported annually by a maintained data base of relocation expenses. Development of any alternate costing method should consider the factors listed in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. Streamlining of the cost development and reimbursement procedures is encouraged so long as adequate accountability for Federal expenditures is maintained. Concurrence by the FHWA is required for any costing method used other than actual cost.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Direct labor costs.</E> (1) Salaries and wages, at actual or average rates, and related expenses paid by the utility to individuals for the time worked on the project are reimbursable when supported by adequate records. This includes labor associated with preliminary engineering, construction engineering, right-of-way, and force account construction.</P>
              <P>(2) Salaries and expenses paid to individuals who are normally part of the overhead organization of the utility may be reimbursed for the time worked directly on the project when supported by adequate records and when the work performed by such individuals is essential to the project and could not have been accomplished as economically by employees outside the overhead organization.</P>
              <P>(3) Amounts paid to engineers, architects and others for services directly related to projects may be reimbursed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Labor surcharges.</E> (1) Labor surcharges include worker compensation insurance, public liability and property damage insurance, and such fringe benefits as the utility has established for the benefit of its employees. The cost of labor surcharges will be reimbursed at actual cost to the utility, or, at the option of the utility, average rates which are representative of actual costs may be used in lieu of actual costs if approved by the STD and the FHWA. These average rates should be adjusted at least once annually to take into account known anticipated changes and correction for any over or under applied costs for the preceding period.</P>
              <P>(2) When the utility is a self-insurer, there may be reimbursement at experience rates properly developed from actual costs. The rates cannot exceed the rates of a regular insurance company for the class of employment covered.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Overhead and indirect construction costs.</E> (1) Overhead and indirect construction costs not charged directly to work order or construction accounts may be allocated to the relocation provided the allocation is made on an equitable basis. All costs included in the allocation shall be eligible for Federal reimbursement, reasonable, actually incurred by the utility, and consistent with the provisions of 48 CFR part 31.</P>

              <P>(2) Costs not eligible for Federal reimbursement include, but are not limited to, the costs associated with advertising, sales promotion, interest on borrowings, the issuance of stock, bad <PRTPAGE P="327"/>debts, uncollectible accounts receivable, contributions, donations, entertainment, fines, penalties, lobbying, and research programs.</P>
              <P>(3) The records supporting the entries for overhead and indirect construction costs shall show the total amount, rate, and allocation basis for each additive, and are subject to audit by representatives of the State and Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Material and supply costs.</E> (1) Materials and supplies, if available, are to be furnished from company stock except that they may be obtained from other sources near the project site when available at a lower cost. When not available from company stock, they may be purchased either under competitive bids or existing continuing contracts under which the lowest available prices are developed. Minor quantities of materials and supplies and proprietary products routinely used in the utility's operation and essential for the maintenance of system compatibility may be excluded from these requirements. The utility shall not be required to change its existing standards for materials used in permanent changes to its facilities. Costs shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Materials and supplies furnished from company stock shall be billed at the current stock prices for such new or used materials at time of issue.</P>
              <P>(ii) Materials and supplies not furnished from company stock shall be billed at actual costs to the utility delivered to the project site.</P>
              <P>(iii) A reasonable cost for plant inspection and testing may be included in the costs of materials and supplies when such expense has been incurred. The computation of actual costs of materials and supplies shall include the deduction of all offered discounts, rebates, and allowances.</P>
              <P>(iv) The cost of rehabilitating rather than replacing existing utility facilities to meet the requirements of a project is reimbursable, provided this cost does not exceed replacement costs.</P>
              <P>(2) Materials recovered from temporary use and accepted for reuse by the utility shall be credited to the project at prices charged to the job, less a considertion for loss in service life at 10 percent. Materials recovered from the permanent facility of the utility that are accepted by the utility for return to stock shall be credited to the project at the current stock prices of such used materials. Materials recovered and not accepted for reuse by the utility, if determined to have a net sale value, shall be sold to the highest bidder by the TD or utility following an opportunity for TD inspection and appropriate solicitation for bids. If the utility practices a system of periodic disposal by sale, credit to the project shall be at the going prices supported by records of the utility.</P>
              <P>(3) Federal participation may be approved for the total cost of removal when either such removal is required by the highway construction or the existing facilities cannot be abandoned in place for aesthetic or safety reasons. When the utility facilities can be abandoned in place but the utility or highway constructor elects to remove and recover the materials, Federal funds shall not participate in removal costs which exceed the value of the materials recovered.</P>
              <P>(4) The actual and direct costs of handling and loading materials and supplies at company stores or material yards, and of unloading and handling recovered materials accepted by the utility at its stores or material yards are reimbursable. In lieu of actual costs, average rates which are representative of actual costs may be used if approved by the STD and the FHWA. These average rates should be adjusted at least once annually to take into account known anticipated changes and correction for any over or under applied costs for the preceding period. At the option of the utility, 5 percent of the amounts billed for the materials and supplies issued from company stores and material yards or the value of recovered materials will be reimbursed in lieu of actual or average costs for handling.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Equipment costs.</E> The average or actual costs of operation, minor maintenance, and depreciation of utility-owned equipment may be reimbursed. Reimbursement for utility-owned vehicles may be made at average or actual costs. When utility-owned equipment is not available, reimbursement will be limited to the amount of rental paid (1) <PRTPAGE P="328"/>to the lowest qualified bidder, (2) under existing continuing contracts at reasonable costs, or (3) as an exception by negotiation when paragraph (f) (1) and (2) of this section are impractical due to project location or schedule.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Transportation costs.</E> (1) The utility's cost, consistent with its overall policy, of necessary employee transportation and subsistence directly attributable to the project is reimbursable.</P>
              <P>(2) Reasonable cost for the movement of materials, supplies, and equipment to the project and necessary return to storage including the associated cost of loading and unloading equipment is reimbursable.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Credits.</E> (1) Credit to the highway project will be required for the cost of any betterments to the facility being replaced or adjusted, and for the salvage value of the materials removed.</P>
              <P>(2) Credit to the highway project will be required for the accrued depreciation of a utility facility being replaced, such as a building, pumping station, filtration plant, power plant, substation, or any other similar operational unit. Such accrued depreciation is that amount based on the ratio between the period of actual length of service and total life expectancy applied to the original cost. Credit for accrued depreciation shall not be required for a segment of the utility's service, distribution, or transmission lines.</P>
              <P>(3) No betterment credit is required for additions or improvements which are:</P>
              <P>(i) Required by the highway project,</P>
              <P>(ii) Replacement devices or materials that are of equivalent standards although not identical,</P>
              <P>(iii) Replacement of devices or materials no longer regularly manufactured with next highest grade or size,</P>
              <P>(iv) Required by law under governmental and appropriate regulatory commission code, or</P>
              <P>(v) Required by current design practices regularly followed by the company in its own work, and there is a direct benefit to the highway project.</P>
              <P>(4) When the facilities, including equipment and operating facilities, described in § 645.117(h)(2) are not being replaced, but are being rehabilitated and/or moved, as necessitated by the highway project, no credit for accrued depreciation is needed.</P>
              <P>(5) In no event will the total of all credits required under the provisions of this regulation exceed the total costs of adjustment exclusive of the cost of additions or improvements necessitated by the highway construction.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Billings.</E> (1) After the executed TD/utility agreement has been approved by the FHWA, the utility may be reimbursed through the STD by progress billings for costs incurred. Cost for materials stockpiled at the project site or specifically purchased and delivered to the utility for use on the project may also be reimbursed on progress billings following approval of the executed TD/utility agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) The utility shall provide one final and complete billing of all costs incurred, or of the agreed-to lump-sum, within one year following completion of the utility relocation work, otherwise previous payments to the utility may be considered final, except as agreed to between the STD and the utility. Billings received from utilities more than one year following completion of the utility relocation work may be paid if the STD so desires, and Federal-aid highway funds may participate in these payments.</P>
              <P>(3) All utility cost records and accounts relating to the project are subject to audit by representatives of the State and Federal Government for a period of 3 years from the date final payment has been received by the utility.</P>

              <P>This subpart applies to:</P>
              <P>(a) New utility installations within the right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct Federal highway projects,</P>
              <P>(b) Existing utility facilities which are to be retained, relocated, or adjusted within the right-of-way of active projects under development or construction when Federal-aid or direct Federal highway funds are either being or have been used on the involved highway facility. When existing utility installations are to remain in place without adjustments on such projects the transportation department and utility are to enter into an appropriate agreement as discussed in § 645.213 of this part,</P>
              <P>(c) Existing utility facilities which are to be adjusted or relocated under the provisions of § 645.209(k), and</P>
              <P>(d) Private lines which may be permitted to cross the right-of-way of a Federal-aid or direct Federal highway project pursuant to State law and regulations and the provisions of this subpart. Longitudinal use of such right-of-way by private lines is to be handled under the provisions of 23 CFR 1.23(c).</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SECTNO>§ 645.205</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Pursuant to the provisions of 23 CFR 1.23, it is in the public interest for utility facilities to be accommodated on the right-of-way of a Federal-aid or direct Federal highway project when such use and occupancy of the highway right-of-way do not adversely affect highway or traffic safety, or otherwise impair the highway or its aesthetic quality, and do not conflict with the provisions of Federal, State or local laws or regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) Since by tradition and practice highway and utility facilities frequently coexist within common right-of-way or along the same transportation corridors, it is essential in such situations that these public service facilities be compatibly designed and operated. In the design of new highway facilities consideration should be given to utility service needs of the area traversed if such service is to be provided from utility facilities on or near the highway. Similarly the potential impact on the highway and its users should be considered in the design and location of utility facilities on or along highway right-of-way. Efficient, effective and safe joint highway and utility development of transportation corridors is important along high speed and high volume roads, such as major arterials and freeways, particularly those approaching metropolitan areas where space is increasingly limited. Joint highway and utility planning and development efforts are encouraged on Federal-aid highway projects.</P>
              <P>(c) The manner is which utilities cross or otherwise occupy the right-of-way of a direct Federal or Federal-aid highway project can materially affect the highway, its safe operation, aesthetic quality, and maintenance. Therefore, it is necessary that such use and occupancy, where authorized, be regulated by transportation departments in a manner which preserves the operational safety and the functional and aesthetic quality of the highway facility. This subpart shall not be construed to alter the basic legal authority of utilities to install their facilities on public highways pursuant to law or franchise and reasonable regulation by transportation departments with respect to location and manner of installation.</P>
              <P>(d) When utilities cross or otherwise occupy the right-of-way of a direct Federal or Federal-aid highway project on Federal lands, and when the right-of-way grant is for highway purposes only, the utility must also obtain and comply with the terms of a right-of-way or other occupancy permit for the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the underlying land.</P>

              <P>For the purpose of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Aesthetic quality</E>—those desirable characteristics in the appearance of the highway and its environment, such as harmony between or blending of natural and manufactured objects in the environment, continuity of visual form without distracting interruptions, and simplicity of designs which are desirably functional in shape but without clutter.<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Border area</E>—the area between the traveled way and the right-of-way line.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Clear roadside policy</E>—that policy employed by a transportation department to provide a clear zone in order to increase safety, improve traffic operations, and enhance the aesthetic quality of highways by designing, constructing and maintaining highway roadsides as wide, flat, and rounded as practical and as free as practical from natural or manufactured hazards such as trees, drainage structures, nonyielding sign supports, highway lighting supports, and utility poles and other ground-mounted structures. The policy should address the removal of roadside obstacles which are likely to be associated with accident or injury to the highway user, or when such obstacles are essential, the policy should provide for appropriate countermeasures to reduce hazards. Countermeasures include placing utility facilities at locations which protect out-of-control vehicles, using breakaway features, using impact attenuation devices, or shielding. In all cases full consideration shall be given to sound engineering principles and economic factors.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Clear zone</E>—the total roadside border area starting at the edge of the traveled way, available for safe use by errant vehicles. This area may consist of a shoulder, a recoverable slope, a non-recoverable slope, and/or the area at the toe of a non-recoverable slope available for safe use by an errant vehicle. The desired width is dependent upon the traffic volumes and speeds, and on the roadside geometry. The current edition of the AASHTO “Roadside Design Guide” should be used as a guide for establishing clear zones for various types of highways and operating conditions. This publication is available for inspection and copying from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all FHWA Division Offices as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7.

              <SECTNO>§ 645.209</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Safety.</E> Highway safety and traffic safety are of paramount, but not of sole, importance when accommodating utility facilities within highway right-of-way. Utilities provide an essential public service to the general public. Traditionally, as a matter of sound economic public policy and law, utilities have used public road right-of-way for transmitting and distributing their services. The lack of sufficient right-of-way width to accommodate utilities outside the desirable clear zone, in and of itself, is not a valid reason to preclude utilities from occupying the highway right-of-way. However, due to the nature and volume of highway traffic, the effect of such joint use on the traveling public must be carefully considered by transportation departments before approval of utility use of the right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct Federal highway projects is given. Adjustments in the operating characteristics of the utility or the highway or other special efforts may be necessary to increase the compatibility of utility-highway joint use. The possibility of this joint use should be a consideration in establishing right-of-way requirements for highway projects. In any event, the design, location, and manner in which utilities use and occupy the right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct Federal highway projects must conform to the clear roadside policies for the highway involved and otherwise provide for a safe traveling environment as required by 23 U.S.C. 109(l)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">New above ground installations.</E> On Federal-aid or direct Federal highway projects, new above ground utility installations, where permitted, shall be located as far from the traveled way as possible, preferably along the right-of-way line. No new above ground utility installations are to be allowed within the established clear zone of the highway unless a determination has been made by the transportation department that placement underground is not technically feasible or is unreasonably costly and there are no feasible alternate locations. In exceptional situations when it is essential to locate such above ground utility facilities within the established clear zone of the highway, appropriate countermeasures to reduce hazards shall be used. Countermeasures include placing utility facilities at locations which protect or minimize exposure to out-of-control vehicles, using breakaway features, using impact attenuation devices, using delineation, or shielding.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Installations within freeways.</E> (1) Each State transportation department shall submit an accommodation plan in accordance with §§ 645.211 and 645.215 which addresses how the State transportation department will consider applications for longitudinal utility installations within the access control lines of a freeway. This includes utility installations within interchange areas which must be constructed or serviced by direct access from the main lanes or ramps. If a State transportation department elects to permit such use, the plan must address how the State transportation department will oversee such use consistent with this subpart, Title 23 U.S.C., and the safe and efficient use of the highways.</P>
              <P>(2) Any accommodation plan shall assure that installations satisfy the following criteria:</P>

              <P>(i) The effects utility installations will have on highway and traffic safety will be ascertained, since in no case <PRTPAGE P="333"/>shall any use be permitted which would adversely affect safety.</P>
              <P>(ii) The direct and indirect environmental and economic effects of any loss of productive agricultural land or any productivity of any agricultural land which would result from the disapproval of the use of such right-of-way for accommodation of such utility facility will be evaluated.</P>
              <P>(iii) These environmental and economic effects together with any interference with or impairment of the use of the highway in such right-of-way which would result from the use of such right-of-way for the accommodation of such utility facility will be considered.</P>
              <P>(iv) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(v) A utility strip will be established along the outer edge of the right-of-way by locating a utility access control line between the proposed utility installation and the through roadway and ramps. Existing fences should be retained and, except along sections of freeways having frontage roads, planned fences should be located at the freeway right-of-way line. The State or political subdivision is to retain control of the utility strip right-of-way including its use by utility facilities. Service connections to adjacent properties shall not be permitted from within the utility strip.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting a transportation department from adopting a more restrictive policy than that contained herein with regard to longitudinal utility installations along freeway right-of-way and access for constructing and/or for servicing such installations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Uniform policies and procedures.</E> For a transportation department to fulfill its responsibilities to control utility use of Federal-aid highway right-of-way within the State and its political subdivisions, it must exercise or cause to be exercised, adequate regulation over such use and occupancy through the establishment and enforcement of reasonably uniform policies and procedures for utility accommodation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Private lines.</E> Because there are circumstances when private lines may be allowed to cross or otherwise occupy the right-of-way of Federal-aid projects, transportation departments shall establish uniform policies for properly controlling such permitted use. When permitted, private lines must conform to the provisions of this part and the provisions of 23 CFR 1.23(c) for longitudinal installations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Direct Federal highway projects.</E> On direct Federal highway projects, the FHWA will apply, or cause to be applied, utility and private line accommodation policies similar to those required on Federal-aid highway projects. When appropriate, agreements will be entered into between the FHWA and the transportation department or other government agencies to ensure adequate control and regulation of use by utilities and private lines of the right-of-way on direct Federal highway projects.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Projects where state lacks authority.</E> On Federal-aid highway projects where the State transportation department does not have legal authority to regulate highway use by utilities and private lines, the State transportation department must enter into formal agreements with those local officials who have such authority. The agreements must provide for a degree of protection to the highway at least equal to the protection provided by the State transportation department's utility accommodation policy approved under the provisions of § 645.215(b) of this part. The project agreement between the State transportation department and the FHWA on all such Federal-aid highway projects shall contain a special provision incorporating the formal agreements with the responsible local officials.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Scenic areas.</E> New utility installations, including those needed for highway purposes, such as for highway lighting or to serve a weigh station, rest area or recreation area, are not permitted on highway right-of-way or other lands which are acquired or improved with Federal-aid or direct Federal highway funds and are located within or adjacent to areas of scenic enhancement and natural beauty. Such areas include public park and recreational lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, historic sites as described in 23 U.S.C. 138, scenic strips, overlooks, rest areas and landscaped areas. The State <PRTPAGE P="334"/>transportation department may permit exceptions provided the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) New underground or aerial installations may be permitted only when they do not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the highway user or impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.</P>
              <P>(2) Aerial installations may be permitted only when:</P>
              <P>(i) Other locations are not available or are unusually difficult and costly, or are less desirable from the standpoint of aesthetic quality,</P>
              <P>(ii) Placement underground is not technically feasible or is unreasonably costly, and</P>
              <P>(iii) The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will employ suitable designs and materials, which give the greatest weight to the aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and cable.</P>
              <P>(3) For new utility installations within freeways, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section must also be satisfied.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Joint use agreements.</E> When the utility has a compensable interest in the land occupied by its facilities and such land is to be jointly occupied and used for highway and utility purposes, the transportation department and utility shall agree in writing as to the obligations and responsibilities of each party. Such joint-use agreements shall incorporate the conditions of occupancy for each party, including the rights vested in the transportation department and the rights and privileges retained by the utility. In any event, the interest to be acquired by or vested in the transportation department in any portion of the right-of-way of a Federal-aid or direct Federal highway project to be vacated, used or occupied by utilities or private lines, shall be adequate for the construction, safe operation, and maintenance of the highway project.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Traffic control plan.</E> Whenever a utility installation, adjustment or maintenance activity will affect the movement of traffic or traffic safety, the utility shall implement a traffic control plan and utilize traffic control devices as necessary to ensure the safe and expeditious movement of traffic around the work site and the safety of the utility work force in accordance with procedures established by the transportation department. The traffic control plan and the application of traffic control devices shall conform to the standards set forth in the current edition of the “Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices” (MUTCD) and 23 CFR part 630, subpart J. This publication is available for inspection and copying from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all FHWA Division Offices as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Corrective measures.</E> When the transportation department determines that existing utility facilities are likely to be associated with injury or accident to the highway user, as indicated by accident history or safety studies, the transportation department shall initiate or cause to be initiated in consultation with the affected utilities, corrective measures to provide for a safer traffic environment. The corrective measures may include changes to utility or highway facilities and should be prioritized to maximum safety benefits in the most cost-effective manner. The scheduling of utility safety improvements should take into consideration planned utility replacement or upgrading schedules, accident potential, and the availability of resources. It is expected that the requirements of this paragraph will result in an orderly and positive process to address the identified utility hazard problems in a timely and reasonable manner with due regard to the effect of the corrective measures on both the utility consumer and the road user. The type of corrective measures are not prescribed. Any requests received involving Federal participation in the cost of adjusting or relocating utility facilities pursuant to this paragrpah shall be subject to the provisions of 23 CFR part 645, subpart A, Utility Relocations, Adjustments and Reimbursement, and 23 CFR part 924, Highway Safety Improvement Program.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Wetlands.</E> The installation of privately owned lines or conduits on the <PRTPAGE P="335"/>right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct Federal highway projects for the purpose of draining adjacent wetlands onto the highway right-of-way is considered to be inconsistent with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, dated May 24, 1977, and shall be prohibited.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Utility determination.</E> In determining whether a proposed installation is a utility or not, the most important consideration is how the STD views it under its own State laws and/or regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State transportation department accommodation policies.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The FHWA should use the current editions of the AASHTO publications, “A Guide for Accommodating Utilities Within Highway Right-of-Way” and “Roadside Design Guide” to assist in the evaluation of adequacy of STD utility accommodation policies. These publications are available for inspection from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all FHWA Division Offices as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7. Copies of current AASHTO publications are available for purchase from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Suite 225, 444 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC 20001, or electronically at <E T="03">http://www.aashto.org.</E> At a minimum, such policies shall make adequate provisions with respect to the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Utilities must be accommodated and maintained in a manner which will not impair the highway or adversely affect highway or traffic safety. Uniform procedures controlling the manner, nature and extent of such utility use shall be established.</P>
              <P>(b) Consideration shall be given to the effect of utility installations in regard to safety, aesthetic quality, and the costs or difficulty of highway and utility construction and maintenance.</P>
              <P>(c) The State transportation department's standards for regulating the use and occupancy of highway right-of-way by utilities must include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The horizontal and vertical location requirements and clearances for the various types of utilities must be clearly stated. These must be adequate to ensure compliance with the clear roadside policies for the particular highway involved.</P>
              <P>(2) The applicable provisions of government or industry codes required by law or regulation must be set forth or appropriately referenced, including highway design standards or other measures which the State transportation department deems necessary to provide adequate protection to the highway, its safe operation, aesthetic quality, and maintenance.</P>
              <P>(3) Specifications for and methods of installation; requirements for preservation and restoration of highway facilities, appurtenances, and natural features and vegetation on the right-of-way; and limitations on the utility's activities within the right-of-way including installation within areas set forth by § 645.209(h) of this part should be prescribed as necessary to protect highway interests.</P>
              <P>(4) Measures necessary to protect traffic and its safe operation during and after installation of facilities, including control-of-access restrictions, provisions for rerouting or detouring traffic, traffic control measures to be employed, procedures for utility traffic control plans, limitations on vehicle parking and materials storage, protection of open excavations, and the like must be provided.</P>

              <P>(5) A State transportation department may deny a utility's request to occupy highway right-of-way based on State law, regulation, or ordinances or the State transportation department's policy. However, in any case where the provisions of this part are to be cited as the basis for disapproving a utility's request to use and occupy highway right-of-way, measures must be provided to evaluate the direct and indirect environmental and economic effects of any loss of productive agricultural land or any impairment of the productivity of any agricultural land that would result from the disapproval. The environmental and economic effects on productive agricultural land together with the possible interference with or impairment of the use of the highway and the effect on highway <PRTPAGE P="336"/>safety must be considered in the decision to disapprove any proposal by a utility to use such highway right-of-way.</P>
              <P>(d) Compliance with applicable State laws and approved State transportation department utility accommodation policies must be assured. The responsible State transportation department's file must contain evidence of the written arrangements which set forth the terms under which utility facilities are to cross or otherwise occupy highway right-of-way. All utility installations made on highway right-of-way shall be subject to written approval by the State transportation department. However, such approval will not be required where so provided in the use and occupancy agreement for such matters as utility facility maintenance, installation of service connections on highways other than freeways, or emergency operations.</P>
              <P>(e) The State transportation department shall set forth in its utility accommodation plan detailed procedures, criteria, and standards it will use to evaluate and approve individual applications of utilities on freeways under the provisions of § 645.209(c) of this part. The State transportation department also may develop such procedures, criteria and standards by class of utility. In defining utility classes, consideration may be given to distinguishing utility services by type, nature or function and their potential impact on the highway and its user.</P>
              <P>(f) The means and authority for enforcing the control of access restrictions applicable to utility use of controlled access highway facilities should be clearly set forth in the State transportation department plan.</P>

              <P>(a) Each State transportation department shall submit a statement to the FHWA on the authority of utilities to use and occupy the right-of-way of State highways, the State transportation department's power to regulate such use, and the policies the State transportation department employs or proposes to employ for accommodating utilities within the right-of-way Federal-aid highways under its jurisdiction. Statements previously submitted and approved by the FHWA need not be resubmitted provided the statement adequately addresses the requirements of this part. When revisions are deemed necessary the changes to the previously approved statement may be <PRTPAGE P="337"/>submitted separately to the FHWA for approval. The State transportation department shall include similar information on the use and occupancy of such highways by private lines where permitted. The State shall identify those areas, if any, of Federal-aid highways within its borders where the State transportation department is without legal authority to regulate use by utilities. The statement shall address the nature of the formal agreements with local officials required by § 645.209(g) of this part. It is expected that the statements required by this part or necessary revisions to previously submitted and approved statements will be submitted to FHWA within 1 year of the effective date of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon determination by the FHWA that a State transportation department's policies satisfy the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 109, 111, and 116, and 23 CFR 1.23 and 1.27, and meet the requirements of this regulation, the FHWA will approve their use on Federal-aid highway projects in that State</P>
              <P>(c) Any changes, additions or deletions the State transportation department proposes to the approved policies are subject to FHWA approval.</P>
              <P>(d) When a utility files a notice or makes an individual application or request to a STD to use or occupy the right-of-way of a Federal-aid highway project, the STD is not required to submit the matter to the FHWA for prior concurrence, except when the proposed installation is not in accordance with this regulation or with the STD's utility accommodation policy approved by the FHWA for use on Federal-aid highway projects.</P>

              <P>(a) This part applies:</P>

              <P>(1) To a contractors' legal liability for bodily injury to, or death of, persons and for injury to, or destruction of, property.<PRTPAGE P="338"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) To the liability which may attach to railroads for bodily injury to, or death of, persons and for injury to, or destruction of, property.</P>
              <P>(3) To damage to property owned by or in the care, custody or control of the railroads, both as such liability or damage may arise out of the contractor's operations, or may result from work performed by railroads at or about railroad rights-of-way in connection with projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the highway construction is under the direct supervision of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), all references herein to the State shall be considered as references to the FHWA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contractor's public liability and property damage insurance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Contractors may be subject to liability with respect to bodily injury to or death of persons, and injury to, or destruction of property, which may be suffered by persons other than their own employees as a result of their operations in connection with construction of highway projects located in whole or in part within railroad right-of-way and financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. Protection to cover such liability of contractors shall be furnished under regular contractors' public liability and property damage insurance policies issued in the names of the contractors. Such policies shall be so written as to furnish protection to contractors respecting their operations in performing work covered by their contract.</P>
              <P>(b) Where a contractor sublets a part of the work on any project to a subcontractor, the contractor shall be required to secure insurance protection in his own behalf under contractor's public liability and property damage insurance policies to cover any liability imposed on him by law for damages because of bodily injury to, or death of, persons and injury to, or destruction of, property as a result of work undertaken by such subcontractors. In addition, the contractor shall provide for and on behalf of any such subcontractors protection to cover like liability imposed upon the latter as a result of their operations by means of separate and individual contractor's public liability and property damage policies; or, in the alternative, each subcontractor shall provide satisfactory insurance on his own behalf to cover his individual operations.</P>
              <P>(c) The contractor shall furnish to the State highway department evidence satisfactory to such department and to the FHWA that the insurance coverages required herein have been provided. The contractor shall also furnish a copy of such evidence to the railroad or railroads involved. The insurance specified shall be kept in force until all work required to be performed shall have been satisfactorily completed and accepted in accordance with the contract under which the construction work is undertaken.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">State-railroad agreements.</E> (1) Where construction of a Federal-aid project requires use of railroad properties or adjustments to railroad facilities, there shall be an agreement in <PRTPAGE P="343"/>writing between the State highway agency and the railroad company.</P>
              <P>(2) The written agreement between the State and the railroad shall, as a minimum include the following, where applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) The provisions of this subpart and of 23 CFR part 140, subpart I, incorporated by reference.</P>
              <P>(ii) A detailed statement of the work to be performed by each party.</P>
              <P>(iii) Method of payment (either actual cost or lump sum),</P>
              <P>(iv) For projects which are not for the elimination of hazards of railroad-highway crossings, the extent to which the railroad is obligated to move or adjust its facilities at its own expense,</P>
              <P>(v) The railroad's share of the project cost,</P>
              <P>(vi) An itemized estimate of the cost of the work to be performed by the railroad,</P>
              <P>(vii) Method to be used for performing the work, either by railroad forces or by contract,</P>
              <P>(viii) Maintenance responsibility,</P>
              <P>(ix) Form, duration, and amounts of any needed insurance,</P>
              <P>(x) Appropriate reference to or identification of plans and specifications,</P>
              <P>(xi) Statements defining the conditions under which the railroad will provide or require protective services during performance of the work, the type of protective services and the method of reimbursement to the railroad, and</P>
              <P>(xii) Provisions regarding inspection of any recovered materials.</P>
              <P>(3) On work to be performed by the railroad with its own forces and where the State highway agency and railroad agree, subject to approval by FHWA, an agreement providing for a lump sum payment in lieu of later determination of actual costs may be used for any of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Installation or improvement of grade crossing warning devices and/or grade crossing surfaces, regardless of cost, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Any other eligible work where the estimated cost to the State of the proposed railroad work does not exceed $100,000 or</P>
              <P>(iii) Where FHWA finds that the circumstances are such that this method of developing costs would be in the best interest of the public.</P>
              <P>(4) Where the lump sum method of payment is used, periodic reviews and analyses of the railroad's methods and cost data used to develop lump sum estimates will be made.</P>
              <P>(5) Master agreements between a State and a railroad on an areawide or statewide basis may be used. These agreements would contain the specifications, regulations, and provisions required in conjunction with work performed on all projects. Supporting data for each project or group of projects must, when combined with the master agreement by reference, satisfy the provisions of § 646.216(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(6) Official orders issued by regulatory agencies will be accepted in lieu of State-railroad agreements only where, together with supplementary written understandings between the State and the railroad, they include the items required by § 646.216(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(7) In extraordinary cases where FHWA finds that the circumstances are such that requiring such agreement or order would not be in the best interest of the public, projects may be approved for construction with the aid of Federal funds, provided satisfactory commitments have been made with respect to construction, maintenance and the railroad share of project costs.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Authorizations.</E> (1) The costs of preliminary engineering, right-of-way acquisition, and construction incurred after the date each phase of the work is included in an approved statewide transportation improvement program and authorized by the FHWA are eligible for Federal-aid participation. Preliminary engineering and right-of-way acquisition costs which are otherwise eligible, but incurred by a railroad prior to authorization by the FHWA, although not reimbursable, may be included as part of the railroad share of project cost where such a share is required.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to issuance of authorization by FHWA either to advertise the physical construction for bids or to proceed with force account construction for railroad work or for other construction affected by railroad work, the following must be accomplished:</P>

              <P>(i) The plans, specifications and estimates must be approved by FHWA.<PRTPAGE P="344"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) A proposed agreement between the State and railroad must be found satisfactory by FHWA. Before Federal funds may be used to reimburse the State for railroad costs the executed agreement must be approved by FHWA. However, cost for materials stockpiled at the project site or specifically purchased and delivered to the company for use on the project may be reimbursed on progress billings prior to the approval of the executed State-Railroad Agreement in accordance with 23 CFR 140.922(a) and § 646.218 of this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) Adequate provisions must be made for any needed easements, right-of-way, temporary crossings for construction purposes or other property interests.</P>
              <P>(iv) The pertinent portions of the State-railroad agreement applicable to any protective services required during performance of the work must be included in the project specifications and special provisions for any construction contract.</P>
              <P>(3) In unusual cases, pending compliance with § 646.216(e)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv), authorization may be given by FHWA to advertise for bids for highway construction under conditions where a railroad grants a right-of-entry to its property as necessary to prosecute the physical construction.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Construction.</E> (1) Construction may be accomplished by:</P>
              <P>(i) Railroad force account,</P>
              <P>(ii) Contracting with the lowest qualified bidder based on appropriate solicitation,</P>
              <P>(iii) Existing continuing contracts at reasonable costs, or</P>
              <P>(iv) Contract without competitive bidding, for minor work, at reasonable costs.</P>
              <P>(2) Reimbursement will not be made for any increased costs due to changes in plans:</P>
              <P>(i) For the convenience of the contractor, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Not approved by the State and FHWA.</P>
              <P>(3) The State and FHWA shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to inspect materials recovered by the railroad prior to disposal by sale or scrap. This requirement will be satisfied by the railroad giving written notice, or oral notice with prompt written confirmation, to the State of the time and place where the materials will be available for inspection. The giving of notice is the responsibility of the railroad, and it may be held accountable for full value of materials disposed of without notice.</P>
              <P>(4) In addition to normal construction costs, the following construction costs are eligible for participation with Federal-aid funds when approved by the State and FHWA:</P>
              <P>(i) The cost of maintaining temporary facilities of a railroad company required by and during the highway construction to the extent that such costs exceed the documented normal cost of maintaining the permanent facilities.</P>
              <P>(ii) The cost of stage or extended construction involving grade corrections and/or slope stabilization for permanent tracks of a railroad which are required to be relocated on new grade by the highway construction. Stage or extended construction will be approved by FHWA only when documentation submitted by the State establishes the proposed method of construction to be the only practical method and that the cost of the extended construction within the period specified is estimated to be less than the cost of any practicable alternate procedure.</P>
              <P>(iii) The cost of restoring the company's service by adustments of existing facilities away from the project site, in lieu of and not to exceed the cost of replacing, adjusting or relocating facilities at the project site.</P>
              <P>(iv) The cost of an addition or improvement to an existing railroad facility which is required by the highway construction.</P>

              <P>The following implements provisions of 23 CFR 646.212(a)(3).</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">a. <E T="03">Lateral Geometrics</E>
              </FP>
              <P>A cross section with a horizontal distance of 6.1 meters, measured at right angles from the centerline of track at the top of rails, to the face of the embankment slope, may be approved. The 6.1-meters distance may be increased at individual structure locations as appropriate to provide for drainage if justified by a hydraulic analysis or to allow adequate room to accommodate special conditions, such as where heavy and drifting snow is a problem. The railroad must demonstrate that this is its normal practice to address these special conditions in the manner proposed. Additionally, this distance may also be increased up to 2.5 meters as may be necessary for off-track maintenance equipment, provided adequate horizontal clearance is not available in adjacent spans and where justified by the presence of an existing maintenance road or by evidence of future need for such equipment. All piers should be placed at least 2.8 meters horizontally from the centerline of the track and preferably beyond the drainage ditch. For multiple track facilities, all dimensions apply to the centerline of the outside track.</P>
              <P>Any increase above the 6.1-meters horizontal clearance distance must be required by specific site conditions and be justified by the railroad to the satisfaction of the State highway agency (SHA) and the FHWA.</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">b. <E T="03">Vertical Clearance</E>
              </FP>
              <P>A vertical clearance of 7.1 meters above the top of rails, which includes an allowance for future ballasting of the railroad tracks, may be approved. Vertical clearance greater than 7.1 meters may be approved when the State regulatory agency having jurisdiction over such matters requires a vertical clearance in excess of 7.1 meters or on a site by site basis where justified by the railroad to the satisfaction of the SHA and the FHWA. A railroad's justification for increased vertical clearance should be based on an analysis of engineering, operational and/or economic conditions at a specific structure location.</P>
              <P>Federal-aid highway funds are also eligible to participate in the cost of providing vertical clearance greater than 7.1 meters where a railroad establishes to the satisfaction of a SHA and the FHWA that it has a definite formal plan for electrification of its rail system where the proposed grade separation project is located. The plan must cover a logical independent segment of the rail system and be approved by the railroad's corporate headquarters. For 25 kv line, a vertical clearance of 7.4 meters may be approved. For 50 kv line, a vertical clearance of 8.0 meters may be approved.</P>
              <P>A railroad's justification to support its plan for electrification shall include maps and plans or drawings showing those lines to be electrified; actions taken by its corporate headquarters committing it to electrification including a proposed schedule; and actions initiated or completed to date implementing its electrification plan such as a showing of the amounts of funds and identification of structures, if any, where the railroad has expended its own funds to provide added clearance for the proposed electrification. If available, the railroad's justification should include information on its contemplated treatment of existing grade separations along the section of its rail system proposed for electrification.</P>
              <P>The cost of reconstructing or modifying any existing railroad-highway grade separation structures solely to accommodate electrification will not be eligible for Federal-aid highway fund participation.</P>

              </FP>
              <P>Two and eight tenths meters of structure width outside of the centerline of the outside tracks may be approved for a structure carrying railroad tracks. Greater structure width may be approved when in accordance with standards established and used by the affected railroad in its normal practice.</P>
              <P>In order to maintain continuity of off-track equipment roadways at structures carrying tracks over limited access highways, consideration should be given at the preliminary design stage to the feasibility of using public road crossings for this purpose. Where not feasible, an additional structure width of 2.5 meters may be approved if designed for off-track equipment only.</P>

              <P>Each year through its field offices, the FHWA will issue an annual call for discretionary bridge candidate submittals including updates of previously submitted but not selected projects. Each State is responsible for submitting such data as required for candidate bridges.

              <FP>The lower the rating factor, the higher the priority for selection and funding.</FP>
              <P>(b) The terms in the rating factor are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) SR is Sufficiency Rating computed as illustrated in appendix A of the Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges, USDOT/FHWA (latest edition); (If SR is less than 1.0, use SR = 1.0);</P>
              <P>(2) ADT is Average Daily Traffic in thousands taking the most current value from the national bridge inventory data;</P>
              <P>(3) ADTT is Average Daily Truck Traffic in thousands (Pick up trucks and light delivery trucks not included). For load posted bridges, the ADTT furnished should be that which would use the bridge if traffic were not restricted. The ADTT should be the annual average volume, not peak or seasonal;</P>
              <P>(4) N is National Highway System Status. N = 1 if not on the National Highway System. N = 1.5 if bridge carries a National Highway System road;</P>
              <P>(5) The last term of the rating factor expression includes the State's unobligated balance of funds received under 23 U.S.C. 144 as of June 30 preceding the date of calculation, and the total funds received under 23 U.S.C. 144 for the last four fiscal years ending with the most recent fiscal year of the FHWA's annual call for discretionary bridge candidate submittals; (if unobligated HBRRP balance is less than $10 million, use zero balance);</P>
              <P>(6) TPC is Total Project Cost in millions of dollars;</P>
              <P>(7) HBRRP is Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program;</P>
              <P>(8) ADT′ is ADT plus ADTT.</P>

              <P>(c) In order to balance the relative importance of candidate bridges with very low (less than one) sufficiency ratings and very low ADT's against candidate bridges with high ADT's, the minimum sufficiency rating used will be 1.0. If the computed sufficiency rating for a candidate bridge is less than 1.0, use 1.0 in the rating factor formula.<PRTPAGE P="368"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) If the unobligated balance of HBRRP funds for the State is less than $10 million, the HBRRP modifier is 1.0. This will limit the effect of the modifier on those States with small apportionments or those who may be accumulating funds to finance a major bridge.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special considerations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The selection process for new discretionary bridge projects will be based upon the rating factor priority ranking. However, although not specifically included in the rating factor formula, special consideration will be given to bridges that are closed to all traffic or that have a load restriction of less than 10 tons. Consideration will also be given to bridges with other unique situations, and to bridge candidates in States that have not previously been allocated discretionary bridge funds. In addition, consideration will be given to candidates that receive additional funds or contributions from local, State, county, or private sources, but not from Federal sources which reduce the total Federal cost or Federal share of the project. These funds or contributions may be used to reduce the total project cost for use in the rating factor formula.</P>
              <P>(b) The need to administer the program from a balanced national perspective requires that the special cases set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and other unique situations be considered in the discretionary bridge candidate evaluation process.</P>
              <P>(c) Priority consideration will be given to the continuation and completion of projects previously begun with discretionary bridge funds which will be ready to begin construction in the fiscal year in which funds are available for obligation.</P>

              <P>It is the policy of FHWA:</P>
              <P>(a) To provide clearances which meet the reasonable needs of navigation and provide for cost-effective highway operations,</P>
              <P>(b) To provide fixed bridges wherever practicable, and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Bridges not requiring a USCG permit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The FHWA has the responsibility under 23 U.S.C. 144(h) to determine that a USCG permit is not required for bridge construction. This determination shall be made at an early stage of project development so that any necessary coordination can be accomplished during environmental processing.</P>
              <P>(b) A USCG permit shall not be required if the FHWA determines that the proposed construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of the federally aided or assisted bridge is over waters (1) which are not used or are not susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce and (2) which are (i) not tidal, or (ii) if tidal, used only by recreational boating, fishing, and other small vessels less than 21 feet in length.</P>
              <P>(c) The highway agency (HA) shall assess the need for a USCG permit or navigation lights or signals for proposed bridges. The HA shall consult the appropriate District Offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if the susceptibility to improvement for navigation of the water of concern is unknown and shall consult the USCG if the types of vessels using the waterway are unknown.</P>

              <P>(d) For bridge crossings of waterways with navigational traffic where the HA believes that a USCG permit may not <PRTPAGE P="369"/>be required, the HA shall provide supporting information early in the environmental analysis stage of project development to enable the FHWA to make a determination that a USCG permit is not required and that proposed navigational clearances are reasonable.</P>
              <P>(e) Since construction in waters exempt from a USCG permit may be subject to other USCG authorizations, such as approval of navigation lights and signals and timely notice to local mariners of waterway changes, the USCG should be notified whenever the proposed action may substantially affect local navigation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Bridges requiring a USCG permit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The USCG has the responsibility (1) to determine whether a USCG permit is required for the improvement or construction of a bridge over navigable waters except for the exemption exercised by FHWA in § 650.805 and (2) to approve the bridge location, alignment and appropriate navigational clearances in all bridge permit applications.</P>
              <P>(b) A USCG permit shall be required when a bridge crosses waters which are: (1) tidal and used by recreational boating, fishing, and other small vessels 21 feet or greater in length or (2) used or susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce. If it is determined that a USCG permit is required, the project shall be processed in accordance with the following procedures.</P>
              <P>(c) The HA shall initiate coordination with the USCG at an early stage of project development and provide opportunity for the USCG to be involved throughout the environmental review process in accordance with 23 CFR part 771. The FHWA and Coast Guard have developed internal guidelines which set forth coordination procedures that both agencies have found useful in streamlining and expediting the permit approval process. These guidelines include (1) USCG/FHWA Procedures for Handling Projects which Require a USCG Permit <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> and (2) the USCG/FHWA Memorandum of Understanding on Coordinating The Preparation and Processing of Environmental Projects. <SU>2</SU>

              <P>(d) The HA shall accomplish sufficient preliminary design and consultation during the environmental phase of project development to investigate bridge concepts, including the feasibility of any proposed movable bridges, the horizontal and vertical clearances that may be required, and other location considerations which may affect navigation. At least one fixed bridge alternative shall be included with any proposal for a movable bridge to provide a comparative analysis of engineering, social, economic and environmental benefit and impacts.</P>
              <P>(e) The HA shall consider hydraulic, safety, environmental and navigational needs along with highway costs when designing a proposed navigable waterway crossing.</P>
              <P>(f) For bridges where the risk of ship collision is significant, HA's shall consider, in addition to USCG requirements, the need for pier protection and warning systems as outlined in FHWA Technical Advisory 5140.19, Pier Protection and Warning Systems for Bridges Subject to Ship Collisions, dated February 11, 1983.</P>
              <P>(g) Special navigational clearances shall normally not be provided for accommodation of floating construction equipment of any type that is not required for navigation channel maintenance. If the navigational clearances are influenced by the needs of such equipment, the USCG should be consulted to determine the appropriate clearances to be provided.</P>

              <P>(h) For projects which require FHWA approval of plans, specifications and estimates, preliminary bridge plans shall be approved at the appropriate level by FHWA for structural concepts, <PRTPAGE P="370"/>hydraulics, and navigational clearances prior to submission of the permit application.</P>
              <P>(i) If the HA bid plans contain alternative designs for the same configuration (fixed or movable), the permit application shall be prepared in sufficient detail so that all alternatives can be evaluated by the USCG. If appropriate, the USCG will issue a permit for all alternatives. Within 30 days after award of the construction contract, the USCG shall be notified by the HA of the alternate which was selected. The USCG procedure for evaluating permit applications which contain alternates is presented in its Bridge Administration Manual (COMDT INST M16590.5). <SU>3</SU>

            <P>(a) Independent walkway projects, independent bicycle projects and nonconstruction bicycle projects shall be financed with 100 percent Federal-aid primary, secondary or urban highway funds, provided the total amount obligated for all such projects in any one State in any fiscal year does not exceed $4.5 million of Federal-aid funds or a lesser amount apportioned by the Federal Highway Administrator to avoid exceeding the annual $45 million cost limitation on these projects for all States in a fiscal year. The Federal Highway Administrator may, upon application, waive this limitation for a State for any fiscal year. This limitation also applies to projects funded <PRTPAGE P="372"/>under § 652.9(d). This limitation does not apply to projects of the type described in § 652.9(c). The FHWA Offices of Direct Federal Programs and Engineering will coordinate projects of the type described in § 652.9(d) to ensure that the annual cost limitations will not be exceeded.</P>
            <P>(b) Specific eligibility requirements for Federal-aid participation in independent and nonconstruction projects are:</P>
            <P>(1) An independent walkway project must be constructed on highway right-of-way or easement, or right-of-way acquired for this purpose. Independent walkway projects may be constructed separately or in conjunction with a Federal-aid highway construction project. Where an independent walkway project is located away from the Federal-aid highway right-of-way, it must serve pedestrians who would normally desire to use the Federal-aid route.</P>
            <P>(2) An independent bicycle project may include the acquisition of land needed for the facility, or such projects may be constructed on existing highway right-of-way or easement acquired for this purpose. Independent bicycle projects may include construction of bicycle lanes, paths, shelters, bicycle parking facilities and other roadway and bridge work necessary to accommodate bicyclists.</P>
            <P>(3) Nonconstruction bicycle projects must be related to the safe use of bicycles for transportation, and may include safety educational material and route maps for safe bicycle transportation purposes. Nonconstruction bicycle projects shall not include salaries for administration, law enforcement, maintenance and similar items required to operate transportation networks and programs, but may include cost of staff or consultants for development of specific nonconstruction projects.</P>
            <P>(c) Bicycle and pedestrian accommodations may also be constructed as incidental features of highway construction projects. These incidental features may be financed with the same type of Federal-aid funds, including funds of the type described in § 652.9(d) (except Interstate construction funds) and at the same Federal share payable as a basic highway project. These accommodations are not subject to the funding limitations for independent walkway, independent bicycle and nonconstruction bicycle projects. In the case of the Interstate construction projects, Federal-aid Interstate construction funds may only be used to replace existing facilities that would be interrupted by construction of the project, or to mitigate specific environmental impacts. Interstate 4R funds provided by 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(5)(B) may be used only for incidental features. As incidental features, these accommodations must be part of a highway improvement and must be located within the right-of-way of the highway, including land acquired under 23 U.S.C. 319 (Scenic Enhancement Program).</P>

            <P>(d) Funds authorized for Federal lands highways (forest highways, public lands highways, park roads, parkways, and Indian reservation roads which are public roads), forest development roads and trails (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, roads or trails under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service), and public lands development roads and trails (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, roads or trails which the Secretary of the Interior determines are of primary importance for the development, protection, administration, and utilization of public lands and resources under his/her control), may be used for independent bicycle routes and independent walkway projects. These funds may not be used for nonconstruction bicycle projects.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">National MUTCD.</E> The MUTCD approved by the Federal Highway Administrator is the national standard for all traffic control devices installed on any street, highway, or bicycle trail open to public travel in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 109(d) and 402(a). For the purpose of MUTCD applicability, open to public travel includes toll roads and roads within shopping centers, airports, sports arenas, and other similar business and/or recreation facilities that are privately owned but where the public is allowed to travel without access restrictions. Except for gated toll roads, roads within private gated properties where access is restricted at all times are not included in this definition. Parking areas, driving aisles within parking areas, and private highway-rail grade crossings are also not included in this definition.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State or other Federal MUTCD.</E> (1) Where State or other Federal agency MUTCDs or supplements are required, they shall be in substantial conformance with the National MUTCD. Substantial conformance means that the State MUTCD or supplement shall conform as a minimum to the standard statements included in the National MUTCD. The FHWA Division Administrators and Associate Administrator for the Federal Lands Highway Program may grant exceptions in cases where a State MUTCD or supplement cannot conform to standard statements in the National MUTCD because of the requirements of a specific State law that was in effect prior to the effective date of this final rule, provided that the Division Administrator or Associate Administrator determines based on information available and documentation received from the State that the non-conformance does not create a safety concern. The guidance statements contained in the National MUTCD shall also be in the State Manual or supplement unless the reason for not including it is satisfactorily explained based on engineering judgment, specific conflicting State law, or a documented engineering study. The FHWA Division Administrators shall approve the State MUTCDs and supplements that are in substantial conformance with the National MUTCD. The FHWA AssociateAdministrator of the Federal Lands Highway Program shall approve other Federal land management agencies MUTCDs and supplements that are in substantial conformance with the National MUTCD. The FHWA Division Administrators and the FHWA Associate Administrators for the Federal Lands Highway Program have the flexibility to determine on a case-by-case basis the degree of variation allowed.</P>
              <P>(2) States and other Federal agencies are encouraged to adopt the National MUTCD in its entirety as their official Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.</P>
              <P>(3) States and other Federal agencies shall adopt changes issued by the FHWA to the National MUTCD within two years from the effective date of the final rule. For those States that automatically adopt the MUTCD immediately upon the effective date of the latest edition or revision of the MUTCD, the FHWA Division Administrators have the flexibility to allow these States to install certain devices from existing inventory or previously approved construction plans that comply with the previous MUTCD during the two-year adoption period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Color specifications.</E> Color determinations and specifications of sign and pavement marking materials shall conform to requirements of the FHWA Color Tolerance Charts. <SU>1</SU>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal-aid highways.</E> (1) Funds apportioned or allocated under 23 U.S.C. 104(b) are eligible to participate in projects to install traffic control devices in accordance with the MUTCD on newly constructed, reconstructed, resurfaced, restored, or rehabilitated highways, or on existing highways when this work is classified as construction in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 101(a). Federal-aid highway funds for eligible pavement markings and traffic control signalization may amount to 100 percent of the construction cost. Federal-aid highway funds apportioned or allocated under other sections of 23 U.S.C. are eligible for participation in improvements conforming to the MUTCD in accordance with the provisions of applicable program regulations and directives.</P>

              <P>(2) Traffic control devices are eligible, in keeping with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the work is classified as construction in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and the State or local agency has a policy acceptable to the FHWA Division Administrator for selecting traffic control devices material or equipment based on items such as cost, traffic volumes, safety, and expected service life. The State's <PRTPAGE P="376"/>policy should provide for cost-effective selection of materials which will provide for substantial service life taking into account expected and necessary routine maintenance. For these purposes, effectiveness would normally be measured in terms of durability, service life and/or performance of the material. Specific projects including material or equipment selection shall be developed in accordance with this policy. Proposed work may be approved on a project-by-project basis when the work is (i) clearly warranted, (ii) on a Federal-aid system, (iii) clearly identified by site, (iv) substantial in nature, and (v) of sufficient magnitude at any given location to warrant Federal-aid participation as a construction item.</P>
              <P>(3) The method of accomplishing the work will be in accordance with 23 CFR part 635, subpart A, Contract Procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Off-system highways.</E> Certain Federal-aid highway funds are eligible to participate in traffic control device improvement projects on off-system highways. In addition, Federal-aid highway funds apportioned or allocated in 23 U.S.C. are eligible for the installation of traffic control devices on any public road not on the Federal-aid system when the installation is directly related to a traffic improvement project on a Federal-aid system route.</P>

              <EAR>Pt. 655, Subpt. F, App.</EAR>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Subpart F of Part 655—Alternate Method of Determining the Color of Retroreflective Sign Materials and Pavement Marking Materials</HD>
              <P>1. Although the FHWA Color Tolerance Charts depreciate the use of spectrophotometers or accurate tristimulus colorimeters for measuring the daytime color of retroreflective materials, recent testing has determined that 0/45 or 45/0 spectroradiometers and tristimulus colorimeters have proved that the measurements can be considered reliable and may be used.</P>

              <P>2. The daytime color of non-fluorescent retroreflective materials may be measured in accordance with ASTM Test Method E1349, “Standard Test Method for Reflectance Factor and Color by Spectrophotometry Using Bidirectional Geometry” or ASTM Test Method E 1347 (Replaces E97), “Standard Test Method for Color and Color-Difference Measurement by Tristimulus (Filter) Colorimetry.” The latter test method specified bidirectional geometry for the measurement of retroreflective materials. The geometric conditions to be used in both test methods are 0/45 or 45/0 circumferential illumination or viewing. Uniplanar geometry is not recommended for material types IV or higher (designated microprismatic). The CIE standard illuminant used in computing the colorimetric coordinates shall be D<E T="52">65</E> and the 2 Degree Standard CIE observer shall be used.</P>

              <P>3. For fluorescent retroreflective materials ASTM E991 may be used to determine the chromaticity provided that the D<E T="52">65</E> illumination meets the requirements of E 991. This practice, however, allows only the total luminous factor to be measured. The fluorescent luminous factor must be determined using bispectral fluorescent colorimetry. Commercial instruments are available which allow such determination. Some testing laboratories are also equipped to perform these measurements.</P>
              <P>4. For nighttime measurements CIE Standard Illuminant A shall be used in computing the colorimetric coordinates and the 2 Degree Standard CIE Observer shall be used.</P>
              <P>5. Average performance sheeting is identified as Types I and II sheeting and high performance sheeting is identified as Type III. Super-high intensity sheeting is identified as Types V, VI, and VII in ASTM D 4956.</P>

              <P>6. The following nine tables depict the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram x and y coordinates for the corner points defining the recommended color boxes in the diagram and the daytime luminance factors for those colors. Lines drawn between these corner points specify the limits of the chromaticity allowed in the 1931 Chromaticity Diagram. Color coordinates of samples that lie within these lines are acceptable. For blue and green colors the spectrum locus is the defining limit between the corner points located on the spectrum locus:<PRTPAGE P="377"/>

            <P>The purpose of this regulation is to prescribe policies and general procedures for administering a program of ridesharing projects using Federal-aid primary, secondary, and urban system funds.</P>
          </SECTION>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Section 126(d) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 declares that special effort should be made to promote commuter modes of transportation which conserve energy, reduce pollution, and reduce traffic congestion.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 656.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Eligibility.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Projects which promote ridesharing programs need not be located on but must serve a Federal-aid system to be eligible for Federal-aid primary, secondary, or urban system funds depending on the system served. The Federal share payable will be in accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 120. Except for paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for all purposes of this regulation the term <E T="03">carpool</E> includes <E T="03">vanpool.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) Projects shall not be approved under this regulation if they will have an adverse effect on any mass transportation system.</P>

            <P>(c) The following types of projects and work are considered eligible under this program:<PRTPAGE P="380"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Systems, whether manual or computerized, for locating potential participants in carpools and informing them of the opportunities for participation. Eligible costs for such systems may include costs of use or rental of computer hardware, costs of software, and installation costs (including both labor and other related items).</P>
            <P>(2) Specialized procedures to provide carpooling opportunities to elderly or handicapped persons.</P>
            <P>(3) The costs of acquiring vanpool vehicles and actual financial losses that occur when the operation of any vanpool is aborted before the scheduled termination date for the reason, concurred in by the State, that its continuation is no longer productive. The cost of acquiring a vanpool vehicle is eligible under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) The vanpool vehicle is a four-wheeled vehicle manufactured for use on public highways for transportation of 7-15 passengers (no passenger cars which do not meet the 7-15 criteria and no buses); and</P>
            <P>(ii) Provision is made for repayment of the acquisition cost to the project within the passenger-service life of the vehicle. Repayment may be accomplished through the charging of a reasonable user fee based on an estimated number of riders per vehicle and the cost of reasonable vehicle depreciation, operation, and maintenance. Repayment is not required under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(A) When vehicles are purchased as demonstrator vans for use as a marketing device. Vehicles procured for this purpose should be used to promote the vanpool concept among employees, employers, and other groups by allowing potential riders and sponsors to examine commuter vans; or</P>
            <P>(B) When vehicles are purchased for use on a trial commuting basis to enable people to experience vanpooling first hand. The trial period must be limited to a maximum of 2 months. That part of the user fee normally collected to cover the capital or ownership cost of the van would be eligible for reimbursement as a promotional cost during the limited trial period. As with established vanpool service, all vehicle operating costs must be borne by the user(s) during the trial period.</P>
            <P>(4) Work necessary to designate existing highway lanes as preferential carpool lanes or bus and carpool lanes. Eligible work may include preliminary engineering to determine traffic flow and design criteria, signing, pavement markings, traffic control devices, and minor physical modifications to permit the use of designated lanes as preferential carpool lanes or bus and carpool lanes. Such improvements on any public road may be approved if such projects facilitate more efficient use of any Federal-aid highway. Eligible costs may also include costs of initial inspection or monitoring of use, including special equipment, to ensure that the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes designation is effective and that the project is fully developed and operating properly. While no fixed time limit is being arbitrarily prescribed for the inspection and monitoring period, it is intended that this activity be conducted as soon as possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and does not extend indefinitely nor become a part of routine facility operations.</P>
            <P>(5) Signing of and modifications to existing facilities to provide preferential parking for carpools inside or outside the central business district. Eligible costs may include trail blazers, on-site signs designating highway interchange areas or other existing publicly or privately owned facilities as preferential parking for carpool participants, and initial or renewal costs for leasing parking space or acquisition or easements or restrictions, as, for example, at shopping centers and public or private parking facilities. The lease or acquisition cost may be computed on the demonstrated reduction in the overall number of vehicles using the designated portion of a commercial facility, but not on a reduction of the per-vehicle user charge for parking.</P>

            <P>(6) Construction of carpool parking facilities outside the central business district. Eligible costs may include acquisition of land and normal construction activities, including installation of lighting and fencing, trail blazers, on-site signing, and passenger shelters. Such facilities need not be located in conjunction with any existing or planned mass transportation service, <PRTPAGE P="381"/>but should be designed so that the facility could accommodate mass transportation in the event such service may be developed. Except for the requirement of the availability of mass/public transportation facilities, fringe parking construction under this section shall be subject to the provisions of 23 CFR part 810.106.</P>
            <P>(7) Reasonable public information and promotion expenses, including personnel costs, incurred in connection with any of the other eligible items mentioned herein.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 656.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Determination of an exception.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The FHWA has determined under provisions of 23 U.S.C. 146(b) that an exceptional situation exists in regard to the funding of carpools so as to allow the State to contribute as its share of the non-Federal match essential project-related work and services performed by local agencies and private organizations when approved and authorized in accordance with regular Federal-aid procedures. The cost of such work must be properly valued, supportable and verifiable in order for inclusion as an eligible project cost. Examples of such contributed work and services include: public service announcements, computer services, and project-related staff time for administration by employees of public and private organizations.</P>
            <P>(b) This determination is based on: (1) The nature of carpool projects to provide a variety of services to the public; (2) the fact that carpool projects are labor intensive and require professional and specialized technical skills; (3) the extensive use of joint public and private endeavors; and (4) the fact that project costs involve the acquisition of capital equipment as opposed to construction of fixed items.</P>
            <P>(c) This exception is limited to carpool projects and therefore is not applicable to other Federal-aid projects. The exception does not affect or replace the standard Federal-aid funding procedures or real property acquisition procedures and requirements, part 712, The Acquisition Function.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policy is that each State enforce vehicle size and weight laws to assure that violations are discouraged and that vehicles traversing the highway system do not exceed the limits specified by law. These size and weight limits are based upon design specifications and safety considerations, and enforcement shall be developed and maintained both to prevent premature deterioration of the highway pavement and structures and to provide a safe driving environment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The objective of this regulation is the development and operation by each State of an enforcement process which identifies vehicles of excessive size and weight and provides a systematic approach to eliminate violations and thus improve conditions.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 657.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Formulation of a plan for enforcement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each State shall develop a plan for the maintenance of an effective enforcement process. The plan shall describe the procedures, resources, and facilities which the State intends to devote to the enforcement of its vehicle size and weight laws. Each State plan must be accepted by the FHWA and will then serve as a basis by which the annual certification of enforcement will be judged for adequacy.</P>
            <P>(b) The plan shall discuss the following subjects:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Facilities and resources.</E> (i) No program shall be approved which does not utilize a combination of at least two of the following listed devices to deter evasion of size and weight measurement in sufficient quantity to cover the FA system: fixed platform scales; portable wheel weigher scales; semiportable or ramp scales; WIM equipment.</P>
            <P>(ii) Staff assigned to the program, identified by specific agency. Where more than one State agency has weight enforcement responsibility, the lead agency should be indicated.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Practices and procedures.</E> (i) Proposed plan of operation, including geographical coverage and hours of operation in general terms.</P>
            <P>(ii) Policy and practices with respect to overweight violators, including off-loading requirements for divisible loads. In those States in which off-loading is mandatory by law, an administrative variance from the legal requirement shall be fully explained. In those States in which off-loading is permissive administrative guidelines shall be included.</P>
            <P>(iii) Policy and practices with respect to penalties, including those for repeated violations. Administrative directives, booklets or other written criteria shall be made part of the plan submission.</P>
            <P>(iv) Policy and practices with respect to special permits for overweight. Administrative directives, booklets or other written criteria shall be made part of the plan submission.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Updating.</E> Modification and/or additions to the plan based on experience and new developments in the enforcement program. It is recognized that the plan is not static and that changes may be required to meet changing needs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Evaluation of operations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The State shall submit its enforcement plan or annual update to the FHWA Division Office by July 1 of each year. However, if a State's legislative or budgetary cycle is not consonant with that date, the FHWA and the State may jointly select an alternate date. In any event, a State must have an approved plan in effect by October 1 of each year. Failure of a State to submit or update a plan will result in the State being unable to certify in accordance with § 657.13 for the period to be covered by the plan.</P>
            <P>(b) The FHWA shall review the State's operation under the accepted plan on a continuing basis and shall prepare an evaluation report annually. The State will be advised of the results of the evaluation and of any needed changes in the plan itself or in its implementation. Copies of the evaluation reports and subsequent modifications resulting from the evaluation shall be forwarded to the FHWA's Office of Operations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for reduction of funds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If it appears to the Federal Highway Administrator that a State has not submitted a certification conforming to the requirements of this regulation, or that the State is not adequately enforcing State laws respecting maximum vehicle size and weight, including laws applicable to vehicles using the Interstate System with weights or widths in excess of those provided under 23 U.S.C. 127, the Federal Highway Administrator shall make in writing a proposed determination of nonconformity, and shall notify the Governor of the State of the proposed determination by certified mail. The notice shall state the reasons for the proposed determination and inform the State that it may, within 30 days from the date of the notice, request a hearing to show cause why it should not be found in nonconformity. If the State informs the Administrator before the end of this 30-day period that it wishes to attempt to resolve the matter informally, the Administrator may extend the time for requesting a hearing. In the event of a request for informal resolution, the State and the Administrator (or designee) shall promptly schedule a meeting to resolve the matter.</P>
            <P>(b) In all instances where the State proceeds on the basis of informal resolution, a transcript of the conference will be made and furnished to the State by the FHWA.</P>
            <P>(1) The State may offer any information which it considers helpful to a resolution of the matter, and the scope of review at the conference will include, but not be limited to, legislative actions, including those proposed to remedy deficiencies, budgetary considerations, judicial actions, and proposals for specific actions which will be implemented to bring the State into compliance.</P>
            <P>(2) The information produced at the conference may constitute an explanation and offer of settlement and the Administrator will make a determination on the basis of the certification, record of the conference, and other information submitted by the State. The Administrator's final decision together with a copy of the transcript of the conference will be furnished to the State.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Administrator does not accept an offer of settlement made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State retains the right to request a hearing on the record pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except in the case of a violation of section 127.</P>

            <P>(c) If the State does not request a hearing in a timely fashion as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Highway Administrator shall <PRTPAGE P="385"/>forward the proposed determination of nonconformity to the Secretary. Upon approval of the proposed determination by the Secretary, the fund reduction specified by § 657.19 shall be effected.</P>

            <P>(d) If the State requests a hearing, the Secretary shall expeditiously convene a hearing on the record, which shall be conducted according to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 555 <E T="03">et seq.</E> Based on the record of the proceeding, the Secretary shall determine whether the State is in nonconformity with this regulation. If the Secretary determines that the State is in nonconformity, the fund reduction specified by section 567.19 shall be effected.</P>
            <P>(e) The Secretary may reserve 10 percent of a State's apportionment of funds under 23 U.S.C. 104 pending a final administrative determination under this regulation to prevent the apportionment to the State of funds which would be affected by a determination of nonconformity.</P>
            <P>(f) Funds withheld pursuant to a final administrative determination under this regulation shall be reapportioned to all other eligible States one year from the date of this determination, unless before this time the Secretary determines, on the basis of information submitted by the State and the FHWA, that the State has come into conformity with this regulation. If the Secretary determines that the State has come into conformity, the withheld funds shall be released to the State.</P>
            <P>(g) The reapportionment of funds under paragraph (e) of this section shall be stayed during the pendency of any judicial review of the Secretary's final administrative determination of nonconformity.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Evaluation</HD>
            <P>The evaluation of an existing plan, in comparison to goals for strengthening the enforcement program, is a difficult task, especially since there is very limited experience nationwide.</P>
            <P>The FHWA plans to approach this objective through a continued cooperative effort with State and other enforcement agencies by gathering useful information and experience on elements of enforcement practices that produce positive results.</P>
            <P>It is not considered practicable at this time to establish objective minimums, such as the number of vehicles to be weighed by each State, as a requirement for satisfactory compliance. However, the States will want to know as many specifics as possible about what measuring tools will be used to evaluate their annual certifications for adequacy.</P>

            <P>The above discussion goes to the heart of the question concerning numerical criteria. The assumption that a certain number of weighings will provide a maximum or even satisfactory deterrent is not supportable. <PRTPAGE P="386"/>The enforcement of vehicle size and weight laws requires that vehicles be weighed but it does not logically follow that the more vehicles weighed, the more effective the enforcement program, especially if the vehicles are weighed at a limited number of fixed locations. A “numbers game” does not necessarily provide a deterrent to deliberate overloading. Consistent, vigorous enforcement activities, the certainty of apprehension and of penalty, the adequacy of the penalty, even the publicity given these factors, may be greater deterrents than the number of weighings alone.</P>
            <P>In recognizing that all States are unique in character, there are some similarities between certain States and useful perspectives may be obtained by relating their program elements. Some comparative factors are:</P>
            <P>1. Truck registration (excluding pickups and panels)</P>
            <P>2. Population</P>
            <P>3. Average Daily Traffic (ADT) for trucks on FA highways</P>
            <P>4. To total mileage of Federal-aid highways</P>
            <P>5. Geographic location of the State</P>
            <P>6. Annual truck miles traveled in State</P>
            <P>7. Number of truck terminals (over 6 doors)</P>
            <P>8. Vehicle miles of intrastate truck traffic</P>
            <P>Quantities relating to the above items can become factors that in the aggregate are descriptive of a State's characteristics and can identify States that are similar from a trucking operation viewpoint. This is especially applicable for States within the same area.</P>
            <P>After States with similar truck traffic operations have been identified in a regional area, another important variable must be considered: the type of weighing equipment that has been or is proposed for predominant use in the States. When data become available on the number of trucks weighed by each type of scale (fixed, portable, semi-portable, etc.) some indicators will be developed to relate one State's effort to those of other States. The measures of activity that are a part of each certification submitted will provide a basis for the development of more precise numerical criteria by which an enforcement plan and its activities can be judged for adequacy.</P>
            <P>Previous certifications have provided information from which the following gross scale capabilities have been derived.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Potential Weighing Capacities</HD>
            <P>1. Permanent scales 60 veh/hr.</P>
            <P>2. Weigh-in-motion scales 100 veh/hr.</P>
            <P>3. Semi-portable scales 25 veh/hr.</P>
            <P>4. Portable scales 3 veh/hr.</P>
            <P>To meet the mandates of Federal and other laws regarding truck size and weight enforcement, the FHWA desires to become a resource for all States in achieving a successful exchange of useful information. Some States are more advanced in their enforcement activities. Some have special experience with portable, semi-portable, fixed, or weighing-in-motion devices. Others have operated permanent scales in combination with concentrated safety inspection programs. The FHWA is interested in information on individual State experiences in these specialized areas as part of initial plan submissions. If such information has recently been furnished to the Washington Headquarters, an appropriate cross reference should be included on the submission.</P>
            <P>It is the policy of the FHWA to avoid red tape, and information volunteered by the States will be of assistance in meeting many needs. The ultimate goal in developing information through the evaluation process is to assemble criteria for a model enforcement program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Additions, deletions, exceptions, and restrictions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>To ensure that the National Network remains substantially intact, FHWA retains the authority to rule upon all requested additions to and deletions from the National Network as well as requests for the imposition of certain restrictions. FHWA approval or disapproval will constitute the final decision of the U.S. Department of Transportation.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Additions.</E> (1) Requests for additions to the National Network, including justification, shall have the endorsement of the Governor or the Governor's authorized representative, and be submitted in writing to the appropriate FHWA Division Office. Proposals for addition of routes to the National Network shall be accompanied by an analysis of suitability based on the criteria in § 658.9.</P>

            <P>(2) Proposals for additions that meet the criteria of § 658.9 and have the endorsement of the Governor or the Governor's authorized representative will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), and if found acceptable, as a final rule.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Deletions—Federal-aid primary—other than interstate.</E> Changed conditions or additional information may require the deletion of a designated route or a portion thereof. The deletion of any route or route segment shall require FHWA approval. Requests for deletion of routes from the National Network, including the reason(s) for the deletion, shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate FHWA Division Office. These requests shall be assessed on the basis of the criteria of § 658.9. FHWA proposed deletions will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for deletion—Federal-aid primary—other than interstate.</E> Requests for deletion should include the following information, where appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Did the route segment prior to designation carry combination vehicles or 102-inch buses?</P>
            <P>(2) Were truck restrictions in effect on the segment on January 6, 1983? If so, what types of restrictions?</P>
            <P>(3) What is the safety record of the segment, including current or anticipated safety problems? Specifically, is the route experiencing above normal accident rates and/or accident severities? Does analysis of the accident problem indicate that the addition of larger trucks have aggravated existing accident problems?</P>
            <P>(4) What are the geometric, structural or traffic operations features that might preclude safe, efficient operation? Specifically describe lane widths, sight distance, severity and length of grades, horizontal curvature, shoulder width, narrow bridges, bridge clearances and load limits, traffic volumes and vehicle mix, intersection geometrics and vulnerability of roadside hardware.</P>
            <P>(5) Is there a reasonable alternate route available?</P>
            <P>(6) Are there operational restrictions that might be implemented in lieu of deletion?</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Deletions and use restrictions—Federal-aid interstate.</E> (1) The deletion of, or imposition of use restrictions on, any specific segment of the Interstate <PRTPAGE P="391"/>Highway System on the National Network, except as otherwise provided in this part, must be approved by the FHWA. Such action will be initiated on the FHWA's own initiative or on the request of the Governor or the Governor's authorized representative of the State in which the Interstate segment is located. Requests from the Governor or the Governor's authorized representative shall be submitted along with justification for the deletion or restriction, in writing, to the appropriate FHWA Division Office for transmittal to Washington Headquarters.</P>
            <P>(2) The justification accompanying a request shall be based on the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Analysis of evidence of safety problems supporting the deletion or restriction as identified in § 658.11(c).</P>
            <P>(ii) Analysis of the impact on interstate commerce.</P>
            <P>(iii) Analysis and recommendation of any alternative routes that can safely accommodate commercial motor vehicles of the dimensions and configurations described in §§ 658.13 and 658.15 and serve the area in which such segment is located.</P>
            <P>(iv) Evidence of consultation with the local governments in which the segment is located as well as the Governor or the Governor's authorized representative of any adjacent State that might be directly affected by such a deletion or restriction.</P>
            <P>(3) Actions to ban all commercial vehicles on portions of the Interstate System not excepted under § 658.11(f) are considered deletions subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) Reasonable restrictions on the use of Interstate routes on the National Network by STAA-authorized vehicles related to specific travel lanes of multi-lane facilities, construction zones, adverse weather conditions or structural or clearance deficiencies are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

            <P>(5) Proposed deletions or restrictions will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as an NPRM, except in the case of an emergency deletion as prescribed in § 658.11(e). The FHWA will consider the factors set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the comments of interested parties. Any approval of deletion or restriction will be published as a final rule. A deletion of or restriction on a segment for reasons ascribable to dimensions of commercial motor vehicles described in either § 658.13 or § 658.15 shall result in a deletion or restriction for the purposes of both §§ 658.13 and 658.15.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Emergency deletions.</E> FHWA has the authority to delete any route from the National Network, on an emergency basis, for safety considerations. Emergency deletions are not considered final, and will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for notice and comment.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Those portions of the Interstate System which were open to traffic and on which all commercial motor vehicles were banned on January 6, 1983, are not included in the National Network.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Restrictions—Federal-aid primary—other than interstate.</E> (1) Reasonable restrictions on the use of non-Interstate Federal-aid Primary routes on the National Network by STAA-authorized vehicles may be imposed during certain peak hours of travel or on specific travel lanes of multi-lane facilities. Restrictions related to construction zones, seasonal operation, adverse weather conditions or structural or clearance deficiencies may be imposed.</P>
            <P>(2) All restrictions on the use of the National Network based on hours of use by vehicles authorized by the STAA require prior FHWA approval. Requests for such restrictions on the National Network shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate FHWA Division Office. Approval of requests for restrictions will be contingent on the ability to justify significant negative impact on safety, the environment and/or operational efficiency.</P>

The group of axles requirement established in this section shall not apply to vehicles legally grandfathered under State groups of axles tables or formulas on January 4, 1975. Grandfathered weight limits are vested on the date specified by Congress and remain available to a State even if it chooses to adopt a lower weight limit for a time.</P>
            <P>(j) The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section shall not apply to the operation on Interstate Route 68 in Allegany and Garrett Counties, Maryland, of any specialized vehicle equipped with a steering axle and a tridem axle and used for hauling coal, logs, and pulpwood if such vehicle is of a type of vehicle as was operating in such counties on U.S. Routes 40 or 48 for such purposes on August 1, 1991.</P>
            <P>(k) Any over-the-road bus, or any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus, is excluded from the axle weight limits in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section until October 1, 2009. Any State that has enforced, in the period beginning October 6, 1992, and ending November 30, 2005, a single axle weight limitation of 20,000 pounds or greater but less than 24,000 pounds may not enforce a single axle weight limit on these vehicles of less than 24,000 lbs.</P>
            <P>(m) The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall not apply to the operation, on I-99 between Bedford and Bald Eagle, Pennsylvania, of any vehicle that could legally operate on this highway section before December 29, 1995.</P>

            <P>(a) No State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access to vehicles with dimensions authorized by the STAA between the NN and terminals and facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest. In addition, no State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access between the NN and points of loading and unloading to household goods carriers, motor carriers of passengers, and any truck tractor-semitrailer combination in which the semitrailer has a length not to exceed 28 feet (28.5 feet where allowed pursuant to § 658.13(b)(5) of this part) and which generally operates as part of a vehicle combination described in §§ 658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a) of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) All States shall make available to commercial motor vehicle operators information regarding their reasonable access provisions to and from the National Network.</P>
            <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any State or local government from imposing any reasonable restriction, based on safety considerations, on access to points of loading and unloading by any truck tractor-semitrailer combination in which the semitrailer has a length not to exceed 28<FR>1/2</FR> feet and which generally operates as part of a vehicle combination described in §§ 658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a).</P>
            <P>(d) No State may enact or enforce any law denying access within 1 road-mile from the National Network using the most reasonable and practicable route available except for specific safety reasons on individual routes.</P>
            <P>(e) Approval of access for specific vehicles on any individual route applies to all vehicles of the same type regardless of ownership. Distinctions between vehicle types shall be based only on significant, substantial differences in their operating characteristics.</P>
            <P>(f) Blanket restrictions on 102-inch wide vehicles may not be imposed.</P>
            <P>(g) Vehicle dimension limits shall not be more restrictive than Federal requirements.</P>
            <P>(h) States shall ensure compliance with the requirements of this section for roads under the jurisdiction of local units of government.</P>
            <P>(i)(1) Except in those States in which State law authorizes the operation of STAA-dimensioned vehicles on all public roads and highways, all States shall have an access review process that provides for the review of requests for access from the National Network.</P>
            <P>(2) State access review processes shall provide for:</P>
            <P>(i) One or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(A) An analysis of the proposed access routes using observations or other data obtained from the operation of test vehicles over the routes;</P>
            <P>(B) An analysis of the proposed access routes by application of vehicle templates to plans of the routes;</P>
            <P>(C) A general provision for allowing access, without requiring a request, for commercial motor vehicles with semitrailers with a kingpin distance of 41 feet or less (measured from the kingpin to the center of the rear axle, if single, or the center of a group of rear axles). State safety analyses may be conducted on individual routes if warranted; and</P>
            <P>(ii) All of the following:</P>
            <P>(A) The denial of access to terminals and services only on the basis of safety and engineering analysis of the access route.</P>
            <P>(B) The automatic approval of an access request if not acted upon within 90 days of receipt by the State. This provision shall become effective no later than 12 months following the effective date of this rule unless an extension is requested by the State and approved by FHWA.</P>

            <P>(C) The denial of access for any 102-inch wide vehicles only on the basis of the characteristics of specific routes, <PRTPAGE P="397"/>in particular significant deficiencies in lane width.</P>
            <P>(j)(1) Each State shall submit its access provisions to FHWA for approval within 6 months after June 1, 1990. In those States in which State law authorizes the operation of STAA-dimensioned vehicles on all public roads and highways, no submission or approval under this paragraph is required. If, in the future, such a State changes its authorizing legislation and restricts the operation of STAA-dimensioned vehicles, then compliance with these provisions will be necessary.</P>
            <P>(2) The FHWA will review the access provisions as submitted by each State subject to the provisions in paragraph (j)(1) and approve those that are in compliance with the requirements of this section. The FHWA may, at a State's request, approve State provisions that differ from the requirements of this section if FHWA determines that they provide reasonable access for STAA-dimensioned vehicles and do not impose an unreasonable burden on motor freight carriers, shippers and receivers and service facility operators.</P>
            <P>(3) Any State that does not have FHWA approved access provisions in effect within 1 year after June 1, 1990 shall follow the requirements and the criteria set forth in this section and section 658.5 and 658.19 for determining access for STAA-dimensioned vehicles to terminals and services. The FHWA may approve a State's request for a time extension if it is received by FHWA at least 1 month before the end of the 1 year period.</P>

            <P>(c) For specific safety purposes and road construction, a State may make <PRTPAGE P="398"/>minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature to route designation and vehicle operating restrictions applicable to combinations subject to 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and 49 U.S.C. 31112 and in effect on June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991, for Alaska). Minor adjustments which last 30 days or less may be made without notifying the FHWA. Minor adjustments which exceed 30 days require approval of the FHWA. When such adjustments are needed, a State must submit to the FHWA, by the end of the 30th day, a written description of the emergency, the date on which it began, and the date on which it is expected to conclude. If the adjustment involves alternate route designations, the State shall describe the new route on which vehicles otherwise subject to the freeze imposed by 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and 49 U.S.C. 31112 are allowed to operate. To the extent possible, the geometric and pavement design characteristics of the alternate route should be equivalent to those of the highway section which is temporarily unavailable. If the adjustment involves vehicle operating restrictions, the State shall list the restrictions that have been removed or modified. If the adjustment is approved, the FHWA will publish the notice of adjustment, with an expiration date, in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Requests for extension of time beyond the originally established conclusion date shall be subject to the same approval and publications process as the original request. If upon consultation with the FHWA a decision is reached that minor adjustments made by a State are not legitimately attributable to road or bridge construction or safety, the FHWA will inform the State, and the original conditions of the freeze must be reimposed immediately. Failure to do so may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.</P>
            <P>(d) A State may issue a permit authorizing a CMV to transport an overlength nondivisible load on two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN without regard to the restrictions in § 658.23(a)(2).</P>

            <P>(e) States further restricting or prohibiting the operation of vehicles subject to 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and 49 U.S.C. 31112 after June 1, 1991, shall notify the FHWA within 30 days after the restriction is effective. The FHWA will publish the restriction in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as an amendment to appendix C to this part. Failure to provide such notification may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.</P>

            <P>(f) The Federal Highway Administrator, on his or her own motion or upon a request by any person (including a State), shall review the information set forth in appendix C to this part. If the Administrator determines there is cause to believe that a mistake was made in the accuracy of the information contained in appendix C to this part, the Administrator shall commence a proceeding to determine whether the information published should be corrected.

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 658—Trucks Over 80,000 Pounds on the Interstate System and Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network</HD>
            <P>This appendix contains the weight and size provisions that were in effect on or before June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991 for Alaska), for vehicles covered by 23 U.S.C. 127(d) (LCV's) and 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j) (commercial motor vehicles (CMV's) with 2 or more cargo-carrying units). Weights and dimensions are “frozen” at the values shown here, which were in effect on June 1, 1991 (Alaska, July 6, 1991). All vehicles are listed by configuration type.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Trucks Over 80,000 Pounds on the Interstate System</HD>
            <P>In the State-by-State descriptions, CMV combinations which can also be LCV's are identified with the letters “LCV” following the type of combination vehicle. The maximum allowable gross vehicle weight is given in this appendix (in thousands of pounds indicated by a “K”), as well as information summarizing the operational conditions, routes, and legal citations. The term “Interstate System” as used herein refers to the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network</HD>
            <P>Listed for each State by combination type is either:</P>
            <P>1. The maximum cargo-carrying length (shown in feet); or</P>
            <P>2. A notation that such vehicle is not allowed (indicated by a “NO”).</P>
            <P>CMV's are categorized as follows:</P>
            <P>1. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and two trailing units.</P>
            <P>2. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and three trailing units.</P>
            <P>3. CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units not included in descriptions 1 or 2.</P>

            <P>In the following table the left number is the maximum cargo-carrying length measured in feet from the front of the first cargo unit to the rear of the last cargo unit. This distance is not to include length exclusive devices which have been approved by the Secretary or by any State. Devices excluded from length determination shall only include items whose function is related to the safe and efficient operation of the semitrailer or trailer. No device excluded from length determination shall be designed or used for carrying cargo. The right number is the maximum gross weight in thousands of <PRTPAGE P="413"/>pounds that the type of vehicle can carry when operating as an LCV on the Interstate System. For every State where there is a length or weight number in the table that follows, additional information is provided.</P>

              <TNOTE>(1)—State submission includes multiple vehicles in this category—see individual State listings.</TNOTE>
              <TNOTE>(2)—No maximum weight is established as this vehicle combination is not considered an “LCV” per the ISTEA definition. Florida's combination is not allowed to operate on the Interstate System, and the combinations for Hawaii, Mississippi, and Nebraska are not allowed to exceed 80,000 pounds.</TNOTE>
              <TNOTE>(3)—No maximum cargo-carrying length is established for this combination. Because State law limits each trailing unit to not more than 28.5 feet in length, this combination is allowed to operate on all NN routes under the authority of the STAA of 1982, regardless of actual cargo-carrying length. The maximum weight listed is New Mexico's maximum allowable gross weight on the Interstate System under the grandfather authority of 23 U.S.C. 127.</TNOTE>
              <TNOTE>(4)—These dimensions do not apply to the same combinations. The 110-foot length is limited to vehicles entering from Oklahoma, also limited to 90K gross weight. The 120K gross weight is limited to vehicles entering from Kansas, also limited to a cargo carrying length of 109 feet.</TNOTE>

            <P>The following abbreviation convention is used throughout the narrative State-by-State descriptions for the captions OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS, ROUTES, and LEGAL CITATIONS: two letter State abbreviation, dash, “TT” for truck tractor, and 2 or 3 for two or three trailing units. For example, the phrase “Arizona truck tractor and 2 trailing units”, would be noted as “AZ-TT2”; the phrase “Indiana truck tractor and 3 trailing units” would be noted as “IN-TT3”, etc.</P>

            <P>OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: The operations of triple trailing unit combinations are governed by two sets of criteria: (1) The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules, and (2) the SVC rules which apply off of the Turnpike except in the case of vehicles operating under Turnpike access authority. The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules allow a maximum combination vehicle length of 119 feet overall. The SVC rules require “Triples” to have trailers of no more than 28.5 feet maximum length or a cargo-carrying length of approximately 95 feet.</P>
            <P>The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules have no time-of-day travel restrictions or other special requirements.</P>
            <P>The SVC rules have several operational conditions. SVC's cannot operate on holidays or during holiday weekends. SVC's cannot be dispatched or operated during adverse weather conditions. SVC's must travel in the right lane, except for passing, and the following distance is 100 feet for every 10 miles per hour. SVC permits can include any restrictions deemed necessary, including specific routes and hours, days, and/or seasons of operation. Rules and regulations can be promulgated regarding driver qualifications, vehicle equipment, and operational standards.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">WEIGHT:</E> All triple trailing unit combinations must comply with the Federal Bridge Formula with maximum axle weights of 20,000 pounds on a single axle and 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle. The maximum gross weight is 120,000 pounds on the Turnpike and Turnpike access routes, but the SVC's have a maximum weight of 110,000 pounds.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">DRIVER:</E> A commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement is required under both Turnpike and SVC rules. In addition, for SVC operation drivers must have completed SVC driver training and a company road test. Drivers must also have 2 years of experience driving tractor-semitrailers and 1 year driving doubles.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">VEHICLE:</E> Vehicle requirements apply to the SVC program only. All axles, except steering axles, must have dual wheels, and all vehicles must be able to achieve and maintain a speed of 40 miles per hour on all grades. Antispray mud flaps shall be attached to the rear of each axle except the steering axle. Mud flaps shall have a surface designed to absorb and deflect excess moisture to the road surface. Drop and lift axles <PRTPAGE P="423"/>are prohibited. Vehicles may have a minimum of six and a maximum of nine axles. The heaviest trailers are to be placed forward. Hazardous cargo is prohibited. Convex mirrors are required on both sides of the cab. Equipment must comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 390-399.</P>
            <P>Any SVC shall be stable at all times during normal braking and normal operation. When traveling on a level, smooth paved surface, an SVC shall follow the towing vehicle without shifting or swerving beyond the restraints of the lane of travel.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">PERMIT:</E> Same as the KS-TT2 combination on the Turnpike and Turnpike access routes. A fee per company plus a permit fee for each power unit is required for the SVC program, and the SVC permits are valid for 1 year. SVC's operated pursuant to regulation 36-1-33 under an annual permit shall be covered by insurance.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">ACCESS:</E> Turnpike access routes include all routes between the Turnpike and a motor freight terminal located within a 10-mile radius of each toll booth, except at the northeastern end of the Turnpike where a 20-mile radius is allowed. SVC access routes include all routes between the Interstate and a motor freight terminal located within 5 miles of the Interstate at Goodland.</P>

            <P>(1) Brake Regulation. The brakes on any vehicle, dolly converter, or combination of vehicles used in tandem-trailer operations as a minimum shall comply with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations in 49 CFR part 393. In addition, any vehicle, dolly converter or combination of vehicles used in tandem-trailer operations shall meet the requirements of the provisions of the Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Law. Tandem-trailer combinations certified on or after June 1, 1968, shall be equipped with suitable devices to accelerate application and release of the brakes of the towed vehicle.</P>
            <P>(2) Axles. A tractor used to haul a tandem trailer combination with a gross weight of more than 110,000 pounds shall be equipped with tandem rear axles, each of which shall be engaged to bear its full share of the load on the roadway surface.</P>

            <P>(3) Tandem Assembly. When the gross weight of the trailers vary by more than 20 percent, they shall be coupled with the heaviest trailer attached to the tractor. Coupling devices and towing devices shall comply with the Federal regulations as stated in 49 CFR part 393. When the distance between the rear of the one semitrailer and the front of the following semitrailer is 10 feet or more, the dolly shall be equipped with a device, or the trailers shall be connected along the sides with suitable material, which will indicate to other Turnpike users that the trailers are connected and are in effect one unit. The MTA shall approve the devices or connections to be used on the semitrailers that would indicate it is one unit. Coupling devices shall be so designed, constructed, and installed, and the vehicles in a tandem trailer combination shall be so designed and constructed to ensure that when traveling on a level, smooth paved surface they will follow in the path of the towing vehicle without shifting or swerving over 3 inches to each side of the path of the towing vehicle when it is moving in a straight line. A tandem <PRTPAGE P="424"/>trailer unit may pass another vehicle traveling in the same direction only if the speed differential will allow the tandem trailer unit to complete the maneuver and return to the normal driving lane within a distance of 1 mile.</P>
            <P>Each truck tractor shall be equipped with at least one spare fuse or other overload protective device, if the devices are not of a reset type, for each kind and size used. The vehicle is to carry at least one set of tire chains for at least one driving wheel on each side between October 15 and May 1 of each year. Each truck tractor shall carry a fire extinguisher which shall have an aggregate rating of 20 BC.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">PERMIT:</E> A permittee must demonstrate to the MTA that it has insurance coverage of the type and amounts required by Turnpike regulation. Both the tractor manufacturer and the permittee shall certify to the MTA, prior to the approval of a tractor, that it is capable of hauling the maximum permissible gross load to be transported by the permittee at a speed not less than 20 miles per hour on all portions of the turnpike system.

As long as each trailing unit is 28.5 feet long or less, cargo-carrying length is not restricted. This combination is listed as a LCV because it can exceed the 80,000-pound threshold established in the Congressional definition. The 86,400-pound gross weight limit is grandfathered for New Mexico.</P>

              <E T="03">WEIGHT:</E> The following information pertains to tandem trailer combinations with either trailer more than 28.5 feet long but not more than 48 feet long. A nine-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 143,000 pounds. An eight-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 138,400 pounds. The maximum gross weight that may be carried upon any combination of units is limited by the maximum gross weight that can be carried upon the axles as follows. For a nine-axle combination: Drive axles—36,000 pounds, axles four/five—36,000 pounds, axles six/seven—27,000 pounds, and axles eight/nine—36,000 pounds. A minimum 12-foot axle spacing between the fifth and sixth axles is also required on the nine-axle LCV. For an eight-axle combination: Drive axles—36,000 pounds, axles four/five—36,000 pounds, sixth axle—22,400 pounds, and axles seven/eight—36,000 pounds. The eight-axle LCV has no minimum axle-spacing requirements. For gross weights in excess of 138,400 pounds the combination must include a tandem-axle dolly to meet the nine-axle requirements. Maximum permissible gross weight for B-train combination is 127,000 pounds.</P>
            <P>When the gross weight of the two trailers in a tandem combination vary more than 20 percent, the heaviest of the two must be placed in the lead position.</P>
            <P>For tandem trailer combinations in which neither trailing unit exceeds 28.5 feet in length the following maximum allowable weights apply: for a single axle—28,000 pounds (except that steering axles may not exceed 22,400 pounds), for a tandem axle—42,500 pounds, for a tri-axle—52,500 pounds. The gross weight may not exceed 100,000 pounds or the manufacturers gross weight rating, whichever is lower.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">DRIVER:</E> For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), except for the full length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, the driver must have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement, and hold a Tandem Trailer Driver's Permit issued by the NYSTA. In order to obtain an NYSTA driver's permit, an applicant must (1) hold a valid commercial driver's license with multiple-trailer endorsement; (2) be over 26 years old, in good health, and have at least 5 years of provable experience driving tractor-trailer combinations; and (3) meet all other application requirements with regard to driving history established by the NYSTA. Qualified drivers receive a Tandem Trailer Driver's Permit for Tandem Vehicle Operation which is valid only for the operation of the certified equipment owned by the company to which the permit is issued.</P>
            <P>For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the New York State DOT, cities not wholly included in one county, the full length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, the driver must have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">VEHICLE:</E> All vehicles must meet the requirements of applicable Federal and State statutes, rules, and regulations. Vehicles operating on highways under the jurisdiction of the NYSTA, except for the full length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, must also meet the following additional requirements. The tractor manufacturer and the permittee shall certify to the NYSTA prior to the approval of the tractor that it is capable of hauling the maximum permissible gross load at a speed of not less than 20 miles per hour on all portions of the thruway system.</P>

            <P>The brakes on any vehicle, dolly converter, or combination of vehicles shall comply with <PRTPAGE P="432"/>49 CFR part 393 and, in addition, any vehicle or dolly converter shall meet the provisions of the New York State Traffic Law.</P>
            <P>Tandem trailer operations shall be equipped, at a minimum, with emergency equipment as required by 49 CFR part 393, subpart H, as amended, tire chains from October 15 to May 1 of each year, a fire extinguisher with an aggregate rating of 20BC, and each trailer with specific lamps and reflectors.</P>
            <P>All tractors certified by the NYSTA for use with tandem trailers will be assigned an identification number by the NYSTA which must be placed on the vehicle. The number must be at least 3 inches in height and visible to a person standing at ground level opposite the driver's position in the cab.</P>
            <P>Axle Type. Tractors to be used for hauling 110,000 pounds or more shall be equipped with tandem rear axles, both with driving power. Tractors to be used for hauling 110,000 pounds or less may have a single drive axle. Tandem combinations using single wheel tires commonly referred to as “Super Singles” are required to use triple-axle tractors, dual-axle trailers, and dual-axle dollies.</P>
            <P>Dollies. Every converter dolly certified on and after June 1, 1968, used to convert a semitrailer to a full trailer may have either single or tandem axles at the option of the permittee. Single-axle dollies may not utilize low profile tires. Combination vehicles with a gross weight in excess of 138,400 pounds must have a tandem-axle dolly to meet the nine-axle requirement. If the distance between two semitrailers is 10 feet or more, the dolly shall be equipped with a device or the trailers connected along the sides with suitable material to indicate they are in effect one unit. The devices or connection shall be approved by the NYSTA prior to use on a tandem trailer combination. The NYSTA tandem-trailer provisions require that converter dollies shall be coupled with one or more safety chains or cables to the frame or an extension of the frame of the motor vehicle by which it is towed. Each dolly converter must also be equipped with mud flaps. Tandem combinations using a sliding fifth wheel attached to the lead trailer, known as a “B-Train” combination, will require a separate Thruway Engineer Service approval prior to the initial tandem run. Special provisions regarding B-Trains will be reviewed at the time of the application or request for use on the Thruway.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">PERMIT:</E> For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the New York State DOT, cities not wholly included in one county, or the following highway sections under NYSTA jurisdiction; the full length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, a permit to exceed the weight limits set forth in section 385(15) of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law must be obtained from the State DOT, city involved, or the NYSTA. A fee is charged for the permit.</P>
            <P>For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the NYSTA, except for the full length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, companies must file an application for a Tandem Trailer Permit with the NYSTA. Permits are issued to such companies upon meeting qualifications, including insurance, for tandem combinations over 65 feet in length. No permit fee is charged; however, Thruway tolls are charged for each use of the Thruway, and the equipment must be certified by the NYSTA annually. The annual re-certification of equipment is handled by: New York State Thruway Authority, Manager of Traffic Safety Services, P.O. Box 189, Albany, New York 12201-0189</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">DRIVER:</E> The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement, be over 26 years of age, in good health, and shall have not less than 5 years of experience driving tractor-trailer or tractor-short double trailer motor vehicles. Such driving experience shall include experience throughout the four seasons. Drivers must <PRTPAGE P="435"/>comply with the applicable current requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations, and the Economic and Safety regulations of the Ohio Public Utility Commission.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">VEHICLE:</E> Vehicles being operated under permit at night must be equipped with all lights and reflectors required by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, except that the trailer shall be equipped with two red tail lights and two red or amber stop lights mounted with one set on each side. Trailer and semitrailer length for doubles cannot exceed 48 feet, and mixed trailer length combinations are not allowed for combination vehicles over 90 feet in length. Combined cargo-carrying length, including the trailer hitch, cannot be less than 80 feet or more than 102 feet. The number of axles on a double shall be a minimum of five and a maximum of nine. A tractor used in the operation of a double shall be capable of hauling the maximum weight at a speed of not less than 40 miles per hour on all portions of the Turnpike.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">PERMIT:</E> A special permit is required if the vehicle is over 102 inches wide, 14 feet high, or 65 feet in length including overhang. Tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations require a permit if over 75 feet in length, excluding an allowed 3-foot front overhang and a 4-foot rear overhang. For vehicles over 120 inches wide, 14 feet high, or 80 feet long or if any unit of the combination vehicle is over 60 feet in length, travel is restricted to daylight hours Monday through noon Saturday, except holidays and the day before and after holidays. Operators are restricted to daylight driving if the load overhang is more than 4 feet. A “Long Double Trailer Permit” issued by the OTC is required for operation of doubles in excess of 90 feet in length. Towing units and coupling devices shall have sufficient structural strength to ensure safe operation. Vehicles and coupling devices shall be so designed, constructed, and installed in a double as to ensure that any towed vehicles when traveling on a level, smooth paved surface will follow in the path of the towing vehicle without shifting or swerving more than 3 inches to either side of the path of the towing vehicle when the latter is moving in a straight line. Vehicle coupling devices and brakes shall meet the requirements of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The distance between the rearmost axle of a semitrailer and the front axle of the next semitrailer in a coupled double unit shall not exceed 12 feet 6 inches. In no event shall the distance between the semitrailers coupled in a double exceed 9 feet. Double and triple trailer combinations must be equipped with adequate, properly maintained spray-suppressant mud flaps on all axles except the steering axle. In the event that the gross weights of the trailers vary by more than 20 percent, they shall be coupled according to their gross weights with the heavier trailer forward. A minimum distance of 500 feet shall be maintained between double units and/or triple units except when overtaking and passing another vehicle. A double shall remain in the right-hand, outside lane except when passing or when emergency or work-zone conditions exist. When, in the opinion of the OTC, the weather conditions are such that operation of a double is inadvisable, the OTC will notify the permittee that travel is prohibited for a certain period of time.</P>
            <P>Class A and B explosives; Class A poisons; and Class 1, 2, and 3 radioactive material cannot be transported in double trailer combinations. Other hazardous materials may be transported in one trailer of a double. The hazardous materials should be placed in the front trailer unless doing so will result in the second trailer weighing more than the first trailer.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">ACCESS:</E> Tandem trailer units shall not leave the Turnpike right-of-way and shall be assembled and disassembled only in designated areas located at Exits 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16.</P>

Vehicle and load shall not exceed 102 inches in width on the Interstate System and other four-lane divided highways. Maximum unit length of triple trailers is 29 feet. Truck tractors pulling triple trailers must have sufficient horsepower to maintain a minimum speed of 40 miles per hour on the level and 20 miles per hour on grades under normal operation conditions. Heavy-duty fifth wheels, pick-up plates equal in strength to the fifth wheel, solid kingpins, no-slack hitch connections, mud flaps and splash guards, and full-width axles are required on triple trailer combinations.

            <P>Speed shall be reduced and extreme caution exercised when operating triple-trailer combinations under hazardous conditions, such as those caused by snow, wind, ice, sleet, fog, mist, rain, dust, or smoke. When conditions become sufficiently dangerous, as determined by the company or driver, operations shall be discontinued and shall not resume until the vehicle can be safely operated. The State may restrict or prohibit operations during periods when, in the State's judgment, traffic, weather, or other safety conditions make such operations unsafe or inadvisable.</P>
            <P>Class A and B explosives; Class A poisons; Class 1, 2, and 3 radioactive material; and any other material deemed to be unduly hazardous by the U.S. Department of Transportation cannot be transported in triple-trailer combinations.</P>

              <E T="03">VEHICLE:</E> For a combination which includes a truck tractor and two trailing units, the lead trailing unit (semitrailer) may be up to 40 feet long. The second trailing unit may be up to 35 feet long. However, the primary control is the total cargo-carrying distance which has a maximum length of 68 feet. Any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.</P>

Permitted movements must have the lighter trailing unit placed to the rear, and use splash and spray devices when operating in rainy weather. Movement is not allowed when road surfaces are hazardous due to ice or snow, or when other atmospheric conditions make travel unsafe.</P>

            <P>The following devices are excluded from measurement of the length or width of a commercial motor vehicle, as long as they do not carry property and do not exceed the dimensional limitations included in § 658.16. This list is not exhaustive.</P>
            <P>1. All devices at the front of a semitrailer or trailer including, but not limited to, the following:</P>

            <P>2. Devices excluded from length measurement at the rear of a semitrailer or trailer including, but not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Handhold;</P>
            <P>(b) Hazardous materials placards and holders;</P>

            <P>(g) Stake pockets; and</P>
            <P>(h) Step.</P>
            <P>3. Devices excluded from width determination, not to exceed 3 inches from the side of the vehicle including, but not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Corner caps;</P>
            <P>(b) Hazardous materials placards and holders;</P>
            <P>(c) Lift pads for trailer on flatcar (piggyback) operation;</P>
            <P>(d) Rain gutters;</P>

            <P>(f) Side marker lamps;</P>
            <P>(g) Structural reinforcement for side doors or intermodal operation (limited to 1 inch from the side within the 3 inch maximum extension);</P>
            <P>(h) Tarping systems for open-top trailers;</P>
            <P>(i) Movable devices to enclose the cargo area of flatbed semitrailers or trailers, usually called tarping systems, where no component part of the system extends more than 3 inches from the sides or back of the vehicle when the vehicle is in operation. This exclusion applies to all component parts of tarping systems, including the transverse structure at the front of the vehicle to which the sliding walls and roof of the tarp mechanism are attached, provided the structure is not also intended or designed to comply with 49 CFR 393.106, which requires a headerboard strong enough to prevent cargo from penetrating or crushing the cab; the transverse structure may be up to 108 inches wide if properly centered so that neither side extends more than 3 inches beyond the structural edge of the vehicle. Also excluded from measurement are side rails running the length of the vehicle and rear doors, provided the only function of the latter, like that of the transverse structure at the front of the vehicle, is to seal the cargo area and anchor the sliding walls and roof. On the other hand, a headerboard designed to comply with 49 CFR 393.106 is load bearing and thus limited to 102 inches in width. However, the “wings” designed to close the gap between such a headerboard and the movable walls and roof of a tarping system are width exclusive, provided they are add-on pieces designed to bear only the load of the tarping system itself and are not integral parts of the load-bearing headerboard structure;</P>
            <P>(j) Tie-down assembly on platform trailers;</P>
            <P>(k) Wall variation from true flat; and</P>
            <P>(l) Weevil pins and sockets on low-bed trailers.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Forest Highway (FH) Program which enhances local, regional, and national benefits of FHs funded under the public lands highway category of the coordinated Federal Lands Highway Program. As provided in 23 U.S.C. 202, 203, and 204, the program, developed in cooperation with State and local agencies, provides safe and adequate transportation access to and <PRTPAGE P="448"/>through National Forest System (NFS) lands for visitors, recreationists, resource users, and others which is not met by other transportation programs. Forest highways assist rural and community economic development and promote tourism and travel.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General principles.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) State and local highway agencies are expected to assume the same responsibility for developing and maintaining adequate highways to permanent defense installations as they do for highways serving private industrial establishments or any other permanent traffic generators. The Federal Government expects that highway improvements in the vicinity of defense installations will receive due priority consideration and treatment as State and local agencies develop their programs of improvement. The FHWA will provide assistance, as requested by MTMC, <PRTPAGE P="452"/>to ascertain State program plans for improvements to roads serving as access to defense installations. Roads which serve permanent defense installations and which qualify under established criteria as Federal-aid routes should be included in the appropriate Federal-aid system.</P>
              <P>(b) It is recognized that problems may arise in connection with the establishment, expansion, or operation of defense installations which create an unanticipated impact upon the long-range requirements for the development of highways in the vicinity. These problems can be resolved equitably only by Federal assistance from other than normal Federal-aid highway programs for part or all of the cost of highway improvements necessary for the functioning of the installation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The MTMC has the responsibility for determining the eligibility of proposed improvements for financing with defense access roads funds. The evaluation report will be furnished to MTMC for its use in making the determination of eligibility and certification of importance to the national defense. The criteria upon which MTMC will base its determination of eligibility are included in the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, Volume 6, Chapter 9, Section 5, Attachment 2. <SU>1</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(b) If the project is determined to be eligible for financing either in whole or in part with defense access road funds, MTMC will certify the project as important to the national defense and will authorize expenditure of defense access road funds. The Commander, MTMC, is the only representative of the DOD officially authorized to make the certification required by section 210, title 23, U.S.C., in behalf of the Secretary of Defense.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Access roads to permanent defense installations and all replacement roads shall be designed to conform to the same standards as the agency having jurisdiction is currently using for other comparable highways under similar conditions in the area. In general, where the agency having jurisdiction does not have established standards, the design shall conform to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. Should local agencies desire higher standards than are currently being used for other comparable highways under similar conditions in the area, they shall finance the increases in cost.</P>
              <P>(b) Access roads to temporary military establishments or for service to workers temporarily engaged in construction of defense installations should be designed to the minimum standards necessary to provide service for a limited period without intolerable congestion and hazard. As a guide, widening to more than two lanes generally will not be undertaken to accommodate anticipated one-way, peak-hour traffic of less than 1,200 vehicles per hour and resurfacing or strengthening of existing pavements will be held to the minimum type having the structural integrity to carry traffic for the short period of anticipated use.</P>

              <P>(a) Determination of the agency best able to accomplish the location, design, and construction of the projects covered by this regulation will be made by the FHWA Division Administrator after consultation with the State and/or local highway agency within whose jurisdiction the highway lies. When an agency other than the State or local highway agency is selected to administer the project, the Division Administrator will be responsible during the life of the project for any necessary coordination between the selected agency and the State or local highway agency.</P>

              <P>(b) Defense access road projects under the supervision of a State or local highway agency, whether on or off the Federal-aid system, shall be administered in accordance with Federal-aid procedures, as modified specifically herein or as limited by the delegations of authority to Regional and Division Administrators, unless approval of other procedures has been obtained <PRTPAGE P="453"/>from Washington Headquarters Office of Direct Federal Programs (HDF-1).</P>
              <P>(c) The Division Administrator shall have a firm commitment from the State or local highway agency, within whose jurisdiction the access road lies, that it will accept the responsibility for maintenance of the completed facility before authorization of acquisition of right-of-way or construction of a project.</P>
              <P>(d) When defense access road funds are available for a pro-rata portion of the total project cost, the remaining portion of the project may be funded as a Federal-aid project if on a Federal-aid route. Defense access road funds shall not be substituted for the State's matching share of the Federal-aid portion of a project.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Missile installations and facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Should damage occur to public highways as a result of construction activities, the contractor would normally be held responsible for restoring the damages. However, should the contractor deny responsibility on the basis of contract terms, restoration is provided for under 23 U.S.C. 210(h).</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Restoration under the contract.</E> (1) The highway agency having jurisdiction over the road shall take appropriate actions, such as load and speed restrictions, to protect the highway. When extensive damage is anticipated and the contractor under the terms of the contract is responsible, it may be necessary to require a performance bond to assure restoration.</P>
              <P>(2) If the contractor does not properly maintain the roads when requested in writing, the highway agency having jurisdiction over the road shall perform extraordinary maintenance as necessary to keep the roads serviceable and maintain adequate supporting records of the work performed. Claims shall be presented to the contractor for this extraordinary maintenance and any other work required to restore the roads. If the contractor denies responsibility on the basis of the contract terms, the claim with the required supporting documentation shall be presented to the contracting officer for disposition and arrangement for reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Restoration under 23 U.S.C. 210(h).</E> (1) To implement 23 U.S.C. 210(h), DOD must make the determination that a contractor for a missile installation or facility did not include in the bid the cost of repairing damage caused to public highways by the operation of the contractor's vehicles and equipment. The FHWA must then make the determination that the State highway agency is, or has been, unable to prevent such damage by restrictions upon the use of the highways without interference with, or delay in, the completion of the contract. If these determinations are made, the Division Administrator will be authorized by the Washington Headquarters to reimburse the highway agency for the cost of the work necessary to keep the roads in a serviceable condition.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of a damage claim, division office representatives accompanied by representatives of the agencies that made the original condition survey will inspect the roads on which damage is claimed. The Division Administrator shall then prepare an estimate of the cost of restoring the roads to original condition as well as any documented cost for extraordinary maintenance for which reimbursement has not been received. No allowance for upgrading the roads shall be included.</P>

A smaller percentage of available funds will be set aside for non-BIA IRR bridges, since States and counties have access to Federal-aid and other funding to design, replace and rehabilitate their bridges and that 23 U.S.C. 204(c) requires that IRR funds be supplemental to and not in lieu of other funds apportioned to the State. The program policy will be to maximize the number of IRR bridges participating in the IRRBP in a given fiscal year regardless of ownership.</P>

The remaining funding in any fiscal year will be made available for PE and construction for use on non-BIA owned IRR bridges.</P>
            <P>(b) At various times during the fiscal year, FHWA will review the projects awaiting funding and may shift funds between BIA and Tribally owned, and non-BIA owned bridge projects so as to maximize the number of projects funded and the overall effectiveness of the program.</P>

            <P>The following funding provisions apply in administration of the IRRBP:</P>

            <P>(a) An IRRBP eligible BIA and Tribally owned IRR bridge is eligible for 100 <PRTPAGE P="458"/>percent IRRBP funding, with a $150,000 maximum limit for PE.</P>
            <P>(b) An IRRBP eligible non-BIA owned IRR bridge is eligible for up to 80 percent IRRBP funding, with a $150,000 maximum limit for PE and $1,000,000 maximum limit for construction. The minimum 20 percent local match will need to be identified in the application package. IRR Program construction funds received by a Tribe may be used as the local match.</P>
            <P>(c) Requests for additional funds above the referenced thresholds may be submitted along with proper justification to FHWA for consideration. The request will be considered on a case-by-case basis. There is no guarantee for the approval of the request for additional funds.</P>

            <P>(a) A request for additional IRRBP funds for cost overruns on a specific bridge project must be submitted to BIADOT and FHWA for approval. The written submission must include a justification, an explanation as to why the overrun occurred, and the amount of additional funding required with supporting cost data. If approved by FHWA, the request will be placed at the top of the appropriate queue (with a contract modification request having a higher priority than a request for additional funds for a project award) and funding may be provided if available.</P>
            <P>(b) Project cost overruns may also be funded out of the Tribe's regular IRR Program construction funding.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How is a list of deficient bridges to be generated?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In consultation with the BIA, a list of deficient BIA IRR bridges will be developed each fiscal year by the FHWA based on the annual April update of the NBI. The NBI is based on data from the inspection of all bridges. Likewise, a list of non-BIA IRR bridges will be obtained from the NBI. These lists would form the basis for identifying bridges that would be considered potentially eligible for participation in the IRRBP. Two separate master bridge lists (one each for BIA and non-BIA IRR bridges) will be developed and will include, at a minimum, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Sufficiency rating (SR);</P>
            <P>(2) Status (structurally deficient or functionally obsolete);</P>
            <P>(3) Average daily traffic (NBI item 29);</P>
            <P>(4) Detour length (NBI item 19); and</P>
            <P>(5) Truck average daily traffic (NBI item 109).</P>
            <P>(b) These lists would be provided by the FHWA to the BIADOT for publication and notification of affected BIA regional offices, Indian Tribal governments (ITGs), and State and local governments.</P>
            <P>(c) BIA regional offices, in consultation with ITGs, are encouraged to prioritize the design for bridges that are structurally deficient over bridges that are simply functionally obsolete, since the former is more critical structurally than the latter. Bridges that have higher average daily traffic (ADT) should be considered before those that have lower ADT. Detour length should also be a factor in selection and submittal of bridges, with those having a higher detour length being of greater concern. Lastly, bridges with higher truck ADT should take precedence over those which have lower truck ADT. Other items of note should be whether school buses use the bridge and the types of trucks that may cross the bridge and the loads imposed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What should be done with a deficient BIA owned IRR bridge if the Indian Tribe does not support the project?</SUBJECT>
            <P>The BIA should notify the Tribe and encourage the Tribe to develop and submit an application package to FHWA for the rehabilitation or replacement of the bridge. For safety of the motoring public, if the Tribe decides not to pursue the bridge project, the BIA shall work with the Tribe to either reduce the bridge's load rating or close the bridge, and remove it from the IRR inventory in accordance with 25 CFR part 170 (170.813).</P>

              <P>(a) The Emergency Relief (ER) program is intended to aid States in repairing road facilities which have suffered widespread serious damage resulting from a natural disaster over a wide area or serious damage from a catastrophic failure.</P>
              <P>(b) ER funds are not intended to supplant other funds for correction of preexisting, nondisaster related deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(c) The expenditure of ER funds for emergency repair shall be in such a manner so as to reduce, to the greatest extent feasible, the cost of permanent restoration work.</P>
              <P>(d) The approval to use available ER funds to repair or restore highways damaged by a natural disaster shall be based on the combination of the extraordinary character of the natural disturbance and the wide area of impact as well as the seriousness of the damage. Storms of unusual intensity occurring over a small area may not meet the above conditions.</P>
              <P>(e) ER funds shall not duplicate assistance under another Federal program or compensation from insurance or any other source. Partial compensation for a loss by other sources will not preclude emergency fund assistance for the part of such loss not compensated otherwise. Any compensation for damages or insurance proceeds including interest recovered by the State or political subdivision or by a toll authority for repair of the highway facility must be used upon receipt to reduce ER fund liability on the project.</P>
              <P>(f) Prompt and diligent efforts shall be made by the State to recover repair costs from the legally responsible parties to reduce the project costs particularly where catastrophic damages are caused by ships, barge tows, highway vehicles, or vehicles with illegal loads or where damage is increased by improperly controlled objects or events.</P>
              <P>(g) The processing of ER requests shall be given prompt attention and shall be given priority over non-emergency work.</P>
              <P>(h) ER projects shall be promptly constructed. Any project that has not advanced to the construction obligation stage by the end of the second fiscal year following the disaster occurrence will not be advanced unless suitable justification to warrant retention is furnished to the FHWA.</P>

              <P>(i) Permanent repair and reconstruction work, not accomplished as emergency repairs, shall be done by the contract method unless the State Highway agency adequately demonstrates that some other method is more cost effective as described in 23 CFR 635.204. <PRTPAGE P="463"/>Emergency repair work may be accomplished by the contract, negotiated contract or highway agency force account methods as determined by the Highway agency as best suited to protect the public health and safety.</P>
              <P>(j) ER program funding is only to be used to repair highways which have been seriously damaged and is not intended to fund heavy maintenance or routine emergency repair activities which should normally be funded as contingency items in the State and local road programs. An application for ER funds in the range of $700,000 or less must be accompanied by a showing as to why the damage repair involved is considered to be beyond the scope of heavy maintenance or routine emergency repair. As a general rule, widespread nominal road damages in this range would not be considered to be of a significant nature justifying approval by the FHWA Division Administrator for ER funding.</P>

              <P>(a) The eligibility of all work is contingent upon approval by the FHWA Division Administrator of an application for ER and inclusion of the work in an approved program of projects.</P>
              <P>(1) Prior FHWA approval or authorization is not required for emergency repairs and preliminary engineering (PE).</P>
              <P>(2) Permanent repairs or restoration must have prior FHWA program approval and authorization, unless done as part of the emergency repairs.</P>
              <P>(b) ER funds may participate in:</P>
              <P>(1) Repair to or reconstruction of seriously damaged highway elements as necessary to restore the facility to pre-disaster conditions, including necessary clearance of debris and other deposits in drainage courses within the right-of way (ROW);</P>
              <P>(2) Restoration of stream channels outside the highway ROW when:</P>
              <P>(i) The public highway agency has responsibility for the maintenance and proper operation of the stream channel section, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The work is necessary for satisfactory operation of the highway system involved;</P>
              <P>(3) Actual PE and construction engineering costs on approved projects;</P>
              <P>(4) Emergency repairs;</P>
              <P>(5) Temporary operations, including emergency traffic services such as flagging traffic through inundated sections of highways, undertaken by the applicant during or immediately following the disaster;</P>
              <P>(6) Betterments, only where clearly economically justified to prevent future recurring damage. Economic justification must weigh the cost of betterment against the risk of eligible recurring damage and the cost of future repair;</P>

              <P>(7) Temporary work to maintain essential traffic, such as raising roadway grade during a period of flooding by <PRTPAGE P="464"/>placing fill and temporary surface material;</P>
              <P>(8) Raising the grades of critical Federal-aid highways faced with long-term loss of use due to basin flooding as defined by an unprecedented rise in basin water level both in magnitude and time frame. Such grade raises are not considered to be a betterment for the purpose of 23 CFR 668.109(b)(6); and</P>
              <P>(9) Repair of toll facilities when the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 129 are met. If a toll facility does not have an executed toll agreement with the FHWA at the time of the disaster, a toll agreement may be executed after the disaster to qualify for that disaster.</P>
              <P>(c) ER funds may not participate in:</P>
              <P>(1) Heavy maintenance such as repair of minor damages consisting primarily of eroded shoulders, filled ditches and culverts, pavement settlement, mud and debris deposits off the traveled way, slope sloughing, slides, and slip-outs in cut or fill slopes. In order to simplify the inspection and estimating process, heavy maintenance may be defined using dollar guidelines developed by the States and Divisions with Regional concurrence;</P>
              <P>(2) Repair of surface damage caused by traffic whether or not the damage was aggravated by saturated subgrade or inundation, except ER funds may participate in:</P>
              <P>(i) Repair of surface damage to any public road caused by traffic making repairs to Federal-aid highways.</P>
              <P>(ii) Repair of surface damage to designated detours (which may lie on both Federal-aid and non-Federal-aid routes) caused by traffic that has been detoured from a damaged Federal-aid highway; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Repair of surface damage to Federal-aid highways caused by vehicles responding to a disaster; provided the surface damage has occurred during the first 60 days after a disaster occurrence, unless otherwise approved by the FHWA Division Administrator.</P>
              <P>(3) Repair of damage not directly related to, and isolated away from, the pattern of the disaster;</P>
              <P>(4) Routine maintenance of detour routes, not related to the increased traffic volumes, such as mowing, maintaining drainage, pavement signing, snow plowing, etc.;</P>
              <P>(5) Replacement of damaged or lost material not incorporated into the highway such as stockpiled materials or items awaiting installation;</P>
              <P>(6) Repair or reconstruction of facilities affected by long-term, pre-existing conditions or predictable developing situations, such as, gradual, long-term rises in water levels in basins or slow moving slides, except for raising grades as noted in § 668.109(b)(8);</P>
              <P>(7) Permanent repair or replacement of deficient bridges scheduled for replacement with other funds. A project is considered scheduled if the construction phase is included in the FHWA approved Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP);</P>
              <P>(8) Other normal maintenance and operation functions on the highway system including snow and ice removal; and</P>
              <P>(9) Reimbursing loss of toll revenue.</P>
              <P>(d) Replacement of a highway facility at its existing location is appropriate when it is not technically and economically feasible to repair or restore a seriously damaged element to its predisaster condition and is limited in ER reimbursement to the cost of a new facility to current design standards of comparable capacity and character to the destroyed facility. With respect to a bridge, a comparable facility is one which meets current geometric and construction standards for the type and volume of traffic it will carry during its design life. Where it is neither practical nor feasible to replace a damaged highway facility in kind at its existing location, an alternative selected through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, if of comparable function and character to the destroyed facility, is eligible for ER reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the total cost of a project eligible for ER funding may not exceed the cost of repair or reconstruction of a comparable facility. ER funds may participate to the extent of eligible repair costs when proposed projects contain unjustified betterments or other work not eligible for ER funds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification.</E> As soon as possible after the disaster, the applicant shall notify the FHWA Division Administrator of its intent to apply for ER funds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Damage survey.</E> As soon as practical after occurrence, the State will make a preliminary field survey, working cooperatively with the FHWA Division Administrator and other governmental agencies with jurisdiction over eligible highways. The preliminary field survey should be coordinated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency work, if applicable, to eliminate duplication of effort. The purpose of this survey is to determine the general nature and extent of damage to eligible highways.</P>
              <P>(1) A damage survey summary report is to be prepared by the State. The purpose of the damage survey summary report is to provide a factual basis for the FHWA Division Administrator's finding that serious damage to Federal-aid highways has been caused by a natural disaster over a wide area or a catastrophe. The damage survey summary report should include by political subdivision or other generally recognized administrative or geographic boundaries, a description of the types and extent of damage to highways and a preliminary estimate of cost of restoration or reconstruction for damaged Federal-aid highways in each jurisdiction. Pictures showing the kinds and extent of damage and sketch maps detailing the damaged areas should be included, as appropriate, in the damage survey summary report.</P>
              <P>(2) Unless very unusual circumstances prevail, the damage survey summary report should be prepared within 6 weeks following the applicant's notification.</P>
              <P>(3) For large disasters where extensive damage to Federal-aid highways is readily evident, the FHWA Division Administrator may approve an application under § 668.111(d) prior to submission of the damage survey summary report. In these cases, an abbreviated damage survey summary report, summarizing eligible repair costs by jurisdiction, is to be prepared and submitted to the FHWA Division Administrator after the damage inspections have been completed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application.</E> Before funds can be made available, an application for ER must be made to, and approved by the FHWA Division Administrator. The application shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A copy of the Governor's proclamation, request for a Presidential declaration, or a Presidential declaration; and</P>
              <P>(2) A copy of the damage survey summary report, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval of application.</E> The FHWA Division Administrator's approval of the application constitutes the finding of eligibility under 23 U.S.C. 125 and shall constitute approval of the application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program and project procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Immediately after approval of an application, the FHWA Division Administrator will notify the applicant to proceed with preparation of a program which defines the work needed to restore or replace the damaged facilities. It should be submitted to the FHWA Division Administrator within 3 months of receipt of this notification. The FHWA field office will assist the applicant and other affected agencies in preparation of the program. This work may involve joint site inspections to view damage and reach tentative agreement on type of permanent corrective work to be undertaken. Program data should be kept to a minimum, but should be sufficient to identify the approved disaster or catastrophe and to permit a determination of the eligibility and propriety of proposed work. If the damage survey summary report is determined by the FHWA Division Administrator to be of sufficient detail to meet these criteria, additional program support data need not be submitted.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Project procedures.</E> (1) Projects for permanent repairs shall be processed in accordance with regular Federal-aid procedures. In those cases where a regular Federal-aid project in a State similar to the ER project would be handled under the project oversight exceptions found in title 23, United States Code, the ER project can be handled in <PRTPAGE P="466"/>a similar fashion subject to the following two conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Any betterment to be incorporated into the project and for which ER funding is requested must receive prior FHWA approval; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The FHWA reserves the right to conduct final inspections on all ER projects. The FHWA Division Administrator has the discretion to undertake final inspections on ER projects as deemed appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) Simplified procedures, including abbreviated plans should be used where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) Emergency repair meets the criteria for categorical exclusions pursuant to 23 CFR 771.117 and normally does not require any further NEPA approvals.</P>

              <P>(d) Replacement highway facilities are appropriate when it is not practical and economically feasible to repair or restore a damaged element to its preexisting condition. Emergency relief is limited to the cost of a new facility constructed to current design standards of comparable capacity and character to the destroyed facility. With respect to a bridge, a comparable facility is one which meets current geometric and construction standards for the type and volume of traffic it will carry during its design life.</P>
              <P>(e) Emergency relief funds may participate to the extent of eligible repair costs when proposed projects contain betterments or other work not eligible for emergency funds.</P>
              <P>(f) Work may include:</P>
              <P>(1) Repair to, or reconstruction of, seriously damaged highway elements for a distance which would be within normal highway right-of-way limits, including necessary clearance of debris and other deposits in drainage courses, where such work would not be classed as heavy maintenance.</P>
              <P>(2) Restoration of stream channels when the work is necessary for the satisfactory operation of the Federal road. The applicant must have responsibility and authority for maintenance and proper operation of stream channels restored.</P>
              <P>(3) Betterments where clearly economically justified to prevent future recurring damage. Economic justification acceptable to the DFDE must weigh the cost of such betterments against the risk of eligible recurring damage and the cost of future repair.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The primary purpose of the requirements in this part is to ensure the prudent use of Federal funds under title 23, United States Code, in the acquisition, management, and disposal of real property. In addition to the requirements of this part, other real property related provisions apply and are found at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 710.103</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part applies whenever title 23, United States Code, grant funding is used, including when grant funds are expended or participate in project costs incurred by the State or other Title 23 grantee. This part applies to programs and projects administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and, unless otherwise stated in this part, to all property purchased with title 23 grant funds or incorporated into a project carried out with grant funding provided under title 23, except property for which the title is vested in the United States upon project completion. Grantees are accountable to FHWA for complying with, and are responsible for ensuring their subgrantees, contractors, and other project partners comply with applicable Federal laws, including this part.</P>

              <P>(b) The parties responsible for ROW and real estate activities, and for compliance with applicable Federal requirements, can vary by the nature of the responsibility or the underlying activity. Throughout this part, the FHWA identifies the parties subject to a particular provision through the use of terms of reference defined as set forth in § 710.105. It is important to refer to those definitions, such as “State Department of Transportation <PRTPAGE P="473"/>(SDOT),” “grantee,” “subgrantee,” “State agency” and “acquiring agency,” when applying the provisions in this part.</P>

              <P>(c) Where title 23 funds are transferred to other Federal agencies to administer, those agencies' ROW and real estate procedures may be utilized. Additional guidance is available electronically at the FHWA Real Estate Services Web site: <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/index.htm.</E>

              <SUBJECT>Grantee and subgrantee responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Program oversight.</E> States administer the Federal-aid highway program, funded under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, through their SDOTs. The SDOT shall have overall responsibility for the acquisition, management, and disposal of real property interests on its Federal-aid projects, including when those projects are carried out by the SDOT's subgrantees or contractors. This responsibility shall include ensuring compliance with the requirements of this part and other Federal laws, including regulations. Non-SDOT grantees of funds under title 23 must comply with the requirements under this part, except as otherwise expressly provided in this part, and are responsible for ensuring compliance by their subgrantees and contractors with the requirements of this part and other Federal laws, including regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Organization.</E> Each grantee and subgrantee, including any other acquiring agency acting on behalf of a grantee or subgrantee, shall be adequately staffed, equipped, and organized to discharge its real property related responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">ROW manual.</E> (1) Every grantee must ensure that its title 23-funded projects are carried out using an FHWA-approved and up-to-date ROW manual or RAMP that is consistent with applicable Federal requirements, including the Uniform Act and this part. Each SDOT that receives funding under title 23, United States Code, shall maintain an approved and up-to-date ROW manual describing its ROW organization, policies, and procedures. Non-SDOT grantees may use one of the procedures in paragraph (d) to meet the requirements in this paragraph; however, the ROW manual options can only be used with SDOT approval and permission. The ROW manual shall describe functions and procedures for all phases of the ROW program, including appraisal and appraisal review, waiver <PRTPAGE P="476"/>valuation, negotiation and eminent domain, property management, relocation assistance, administrative settlements, legal settlements, and oversight of its subgrantees and contractors. The ROW manual shall also specify procedures to prevent conflict of interest and avoid fraud, waste, and abuse. The ROW manual shall be in sufficient detail and depth to guide the grantee, its employees, and others involved in acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property interests. Grantees, subgrantees, and their contractors must comply with current FHWA requirements whether or not the requirements are included in the FHWA-approved ROW manual.</P>
              <P>(2) The SDOT's ROW manual must be developed and updated, as a minimum, to meet the following schedule:</P>
              <P>(i) The SDOTs shall prepare and submit for approval by FHWA an up-to-date ROW Manual by no later than August 23, 2018.</P>
              <P>(ii) Every 5 years thereafter, the chief administrative officer of the SDOT shall certify to the FHWA that the current SDOT ROW manual conforms to existing practices and contains necessary procedures to ensure compliance with Federal and State real estate law and regulation, including this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) The SDOT shall update its ROW manual periodically to reflect changes in operations and submit the updated materials for approval by the FHWA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">ROW manual alternatives.</E> Non-SDOT grantees, and all subgrantees, design-build contractors, and other acquiring agencies carrying out a project funded by a grant under title 23, United States Code, must demonstrate that they will use FHWA-approved ROW procedures for acquisition and other real estate activities, and that they have the ability to comply with current FHWA requirements, including this part. This can be done through any of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(1) Certification in writing that the acquiring agency will adopt and use the FHWA-approved SDOT ROW manual;</P>
              <P>(2) Submission of the acquiring agency's own ROW manual to the grantee for review and determination whether it complies with Federal and State requirements, together with a certification that once the reviewing agency approves the manual, the acquiring agency will use the approved ROW manual; or</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Submission of a RAMP setting forth the procedures the acquiring agency or design-build contractor intends to follow for a specified project or group of projects, along with a certification that if the reviewing agency approves the RAMP, the acquiring agency or design-build contractor will follow the approved RAMP for the specified program or project(s). The use of a RAMP is appropriate for a subgrantee, non-SDOT grantee, or design-build contractor if that party infrequently carries out title 23 programs or projects, the program or project is non-controversial, and the project is not complex.</P>
              <P>(ii) Subgrantees, design-build contractors, and other acquiring agencies carrying out a project for an SDOT submit the required certification and information to the SDOT, and the SDOT will review and make a determination on behalf of FHWA. Non-SDOT grantees submit the required certification and information directly to FHWA. Non-SDOT grantees are responsible for submitting to FHWA the required certification and information for any subgrantee, contractor, and other acquiring agency carrying out a project for the non-SDOT grantee.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Record keeping.</E> The acquiring agency shall maintain adequate records of its acquisition and property management activities.</P>
              <P>(1) Acquisition records, including records related to owner or tenant displacements, and property inventories of improvements acquired shall be in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this part and 49 CFR part 24. These records shall be retained at least 3 years from the later of either:</P>
              <P>(i) The date the SDOT or other grantee receives Federal reimbursement of the final payment made to each owner of a property and to each person displaced from a property; or</P>

              <P>(ii) The date of reimbursement for early acquisitions or credit toward the State share of a project is approved based on early acquisition activities under § 710.501.<PRTPAGE P="477"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Property management records shall include inventories of real property interests considered excess to project or program needs, as well as all authorized ROW use agreements for real property acquired with title 23 funds or incorporated into a program or project that received title 23 funding.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Procurement.</E> Contracting for all activities required in support of an SDOT's or other grantee's ROW projects or programs through the use of private consultants and other services shall conform to 2 CFR 200.317, except to the extent that the procurement is required to adhere to requirements under 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2) and 23 CFR part 172 for engineering and design related consultant services.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of other public land acquisition organizations, conservation organizations, or private consultants.</E> The grantee may enter into written agreements with other State, county, municipal, or local public land acquisition organizations, conservation organizations, private consultants, or other persons to carry out its authorities under this part. Such organizations, firms, or persons must comply with the grantee's ROW manual or RAMP as approved in accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section. The grantee shall monitor any such real property interest acquisition activities to ensure compliance with State and Federal law, and is responsible for informing such persons of all such requirements and for imposing sanctions in cases of material non-compliance.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Assignment of FHWA approval actions to an SDOT.</E> The SDOT and FHWA will agree in their Stewardship/Oversight Agreement on the scope of property-related oversight and approvals under this part that will be performed directly by FHWA and those that FHWA will assign to the SDOT. This assignment provision does not apply to other grantees of title 23 funds. The content of the most recent Stewardship/Oversight Agreement shall be reflected in the FHWA-approved SDOT ROW manual. The agreement, and thus the SDOT ROW manual, will indicate which Federal-aid projects require submission of materials for FHWA review and approval. The FHWA retains responsibility for any approval action not expressly assigned to the SDOT in the Stewardship/Oversight Agreement.</P>

Grantees must ensure all acquisition and related relocation assistance activities are performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 24 and this part. If a grantee does not directly own the real property interests used for a title 23 project, the grantee must have an enforceable subgrant agreement or other agreement with the owner of the ROW that permits the grantee to enforce applicable Federal requirements affecting the real property interests, including real property management requirements under subpart D of this part.</P>

The grantee shall submit a ROW certification in accordance with 23 CFR 635.309(p) when requesting FHWA's authorization. The grantee shall ensure that ROW is available prior to the start of physical construction on individual properties.</P>
              <P>(b) The decision to advance a ROW segment to the construction stage shall not impair the safety or in any way be coercive in the context of 49 CFR 24.102(h) with respect to unacquired or occupied properties on the same or adjacent segments of project ROW.</P>
              <P>(c) The grantee may choose not to allow construction to commence until all property is acquired and relocations have been completed; or, the grantee may permit the construction to be phased or segmented to allow ROW activities to be completed on individual properties or a group of properties, with ROW certifications done in a manner satisfactory to the grantee for each phase or segment.</P>
              <P>(d) If the grantee elects to include ROW services within the design-builder's scope of work for the design-build contract, the following provisions must be addressed in the request for proposals document:</P>
              <P>(1) The design-builder must submit written certification in its proposal that it will comply with the process and procedures in the FHWA-approved ROW manual or RAMP as provided in § 710.201(c) and (d).</P>

              <P>(2) When relocation of displaced persons from their dwellings has not been completed, the grantee or design-builder shall establish a hold off zone around all occupied properties to ensure compliance with ROW procedures prior to starting construction activities in affected areas. The limits of this zone should be established by the grantee prior to the design-builder entering onto the property. There should be no construction-related activity within the hold off zone until the property is vacated.

              <P>This subpart describes the grantee's responsibilities to control the use of real property acquired for a project in which Federal funds participated in any phase of the project. The grantee shall specify in its approved ROW manual or RAMP, the procedures for the maintenance, ROW use agreements, and disposal of real property interests acquired with title 23 funds. The grantee shall ensure that subgrantees, including local agencies, follow Federal requirements and approved ROW procedures as provided in § 710.201(c) and (d).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Management.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As provided in § 710.201(h), FHWA and SDOT may use their Stewardship/Oversight Agreement to enter into a written agreement establishing which approvals the SDOT may make on behalf of FHWA, provided FHWA may not assign to the SDOT the decision to allow any ROW use agreement or any disposal on or within the approved ROW limits of the Interstate, including any change in access control. The assignment agreement provisions in § 710.201(h) and this paragraph do not apply to non-SDOT grantees.</P>
              <P>(b) The grantee must ensure that all real property interests within the approved ROW limits or other project limits of a facility that has been funded under title 23 are devoted exclusively to the purposes of that facility and the facility is preserved free of all other public or private alternative uses, unless such non-highway alternative uses are permitted by Federal law (including regulations) or the FHWA. An alternative use, whether temporary under § 710.405 or permanent as provided in § 710.409, must be in the public interest, consistent with the continued operation, maintenance, and safety of the facility, and such use must not impair the highway or interfere with the free and safe flow of traffic (see also 23 CFR 1.23). Park and Ride lots are exempted from the provisions of this part. Park and Ride lots requirements are found 23 U.S.C. 137 and 23 CFR 810.106.</P>
              <P>(c) Grantees shall specify procedures in their approved ROW manual or RAMP for determining when a real property interest is excess real property and may be disposed of in accordance with this part. These procedures must provide for coordination among relevant State organizational units that may be interested in the proposed use or disposal of the real property. Grantees also shall specify procedures in their ROW manual or RAMP for determining when a real property interest is excess and when a real property interest may be made available under a ROW use agreement for an alternative use that satisfies the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Disposal actions and ROW use agreements, including leasing actions, are subject to 23 CFR part 771.</P>
              <P>(e) Current fair market value must be charged for the use or disposal of all real property interests if those real property interests were obtained with title 23, United States Code, funding except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section. The term fair market value as used for acquisition and disposal purposes is as defined by State statute and/or State court decisions. Exceptions to the requirement for charging fair market value must be submitted to FHWA in writing and may be approved by FHWA in the following situations:</P>

              <P>(1) When the grantee shows that an exception is in the overall public interest based on social, environmental, or <PRTPAGE P="482"/>economic benefits, or is for a nonproprietary governmental use. The grantee's ROW manual or RAMP must include criteria for evaluating disposals at less than fair market value, and a method for ensuring the public will receive the benefit used to justify the less than fair market value disposal.</P>
              <P>(2) Use by public utilities in accordance with 23 CFR part 645.</P>
              <P>(3) Use by railroads in accordance with 23 CFR part 646.</P>
              <P>(4) Use for bikeways and pedestrian walkways in accordance with 23 CFR part 652.</P>
              <P>(5) Uses under 23 U.S.C. 142(f), Public Transportation. Lands and ROWs of a highway constructed using Federal-aid highway funds may be made available without charge to a publicly owned mass transit authority for public transit purposes whenever the public interest will be served, and where this can be accomplished without impairing automotive safety or future highway improvements.</P>
              <P>(6) Use for other transportation projects eligible for assistance under title 23 of the United States Code, provided that a concession agreement, as defined in § 710.703, shall not constitute a transportation project exempt from fair market value requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) The Federal share of net income from the use or disposal of real property interests obtained with title 23 funds shall be used by the grantee for activities eligible for funding under title 23. Where project income derived from the use or disposal of real property interests is used for subsequent title 23-eligible projects, the funds are not considered Federal financial assistance and use of the income does not cause title 23 requirements to apply.</P>

              <P>(a) A ROW use agreement for the non-highway use of real property interests may be executed with a public entity or private party in accordance with § 710.403 and this section. Any non-highway alternative use of real property interests requires approval by FHWA, including a determination by FHWA that such occupancy, use, or reservation is in the public interest; is consistent with the continued use, operations, maintenance, and safety of the facility; and such use does not impair the highway or interfere with the free and safe flow of traffic as described in § 710.403(b). Except for Interstate Highways, where the SDOT controls the real property interest, the FHWA may assign its determination and approval responsibilities to the SDOT in their Stewardship/Oversight Agreement.</P>
              <P>(1) This section applies to highways as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) that received title 23, United States Code, financial assistance in any way.</P>
              <P>(2) This section does not apply to the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Uses by railroads and public utilities which cross or otherwise occupy Federal-aid highway ROW and that are governed by other sections of this title;</P>
              <P>(ii) Relocations of railroads or utilities for which reimbursement is claimed under 23 CFR part 140, subparts E and H, 23 CFR part 645, or 23 CFR part 646, subpart B; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Bikeways and pedestrian walkways as covered in 23 CFR part 652.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to the requirements in this subpart, ROW use agreements for a time-limited occupancy or use of real property interests may be approved if the grantee has acquired sufficient legal right, title, and interest in the ROW of a federally assisted highway to permit the non-highway use. A ROW use agreement must contain provisions that address the following items:</P>
              <P>(1) Ensure the safety and integrity of the federally assisted facility;</P>
              <P>(2) Define the term of the agreement;</P>
              <P>(3) Identify the design and location of the non-highway use;</P>
              <P>(4) Establish terms for revocation of the ROW use agreement and removal of improvements at no cost to the FHWA;</P>
              <P>(5) Provide for adequate insurance to hold the grantee and the FHWA harmless;</P>
              <P>(6) Require compliance with nondiscrimination requirements;</P>

              <P>(7) Require grantee and FHWA approval, if not assigned to SDOT, and SDOT approval if the agreement affects a Federal-aid highway and the SDOT is not the grantee, for any significant revision in the design, construction, or operation of the non-highway use; and<PRTPAGE P="483"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) Grant access to the non-highway use by the grantee and FHWA, and the SDOT if the agreement affects a Federal-aid highway and the SDOT is not the grantee, for inspection, maintenance, and for activities needed for reconstruction of the highway facility.</P>

              <P>(9) Additional terms and conditions appropriate for inclusion in ROW use agreements are described in FHWA guidance at <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/real_estate/right-of-way/corridor_management/airspace_guidelines.cfm.</E> The terms and conditions listed in the guidance are not mandatory requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) Where a proposed use requires changes in the existing highway, such changes shall be provided without cost to Federal funds unless otherwise specifically agreed to by the grantee and FHWA.</P>
              <P>(d) Proposed uses of real property interests shall conform to the current design standards and safety criteria of FHWA for the functional classification of the highway facility in which the property is located.</P>
              <P>(e) An individual, company, organization, or public agency desiring to use real property interests shall submit a written request to the grantee, together with an application supporting the proposal. If FHWA is the approving authority, the grantee shall forward the request, application, and the SDOT's recommendation if the proposal affects a Federal-aid highway, and the proposed ROW use agreement, together with its recommendation and any necessary supplemental information, to FHWA. The submission shall affirmatively provide for adherence to all requirements contained in this subpart and must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification of the party responsible for developing and operating the proposed use;</P>
              <P>(2) A general statement of the proposed use;</P>
              <P>(3) A description of why the proposed use would be in the public interest;</P>
              <P>(4) Information demonstrating the proposed use would not impair the highway or interfere with the free and safe flow of traffic;</P>
              <P>(5) The proposed design for the use of the space, including any facilities to be constructed;</P>
              <P>(6) Maps, plans, or sketches to adequately demonstrate the relationship of the proposed project to the highway facility;</P>
              <P>(7) Provision for vertical and horizontal access for maintenance purposes;</P>
              <P>(8) A description of other general provisions such as the term of use, insurance requirements, design limitations, safety mandates, accessibility, and maintenance as outlined further in this section; and</P>
              <P>(9) An adequately detailed three-dimensional presentation of the space to be used and the facility to be constructed if required by FHWA or the grantor. Maps and plans may not be required if the available real property interest is to be used for leisure activities (such as walking or biking), beautification, parking of motor vehicles, public mass transit facilities, and similar uses. In such cases, an acceptable metes and bounds description of the surface area, and appropriate plans or cross sections clearly defining the vertical use limits, may be furnished in lieu of a three-dimensional description, at the grantee's discretion.</P>

              <P>(a) Excess real property outside or within the approved right-of-way limits or other project limits may be sold or conveyed to a public entity or to a private party in accordance with § 710.403(a), (c), (d), (e), (f) and this section. Approval by FHWA is required for disposal of excess real property unless otherwise provided in this section or in the FHWA-SDOT Stewardship/Oversight Agreement.</P>

              <P>(b) Federal, State, and local agencies shall be afforded the opportunity to acquire excess real property considered for disposal when such real property interests have potential use for parks, conservation, recreation, or related purposes, and when such a transfer is allowed by State law. When this potential exists, the grantee shall notify the appropriate agencies of its intentions <PRTPAGE P="484"/>to dispose of the real property interests determined to be excess.</P>
              <P>(c) The grantee may decide to retain excess real property to restore, preserve, or improve the scenic beauty and environmental quality adjacent to the transportation facility.</P>
              <P>(d) Where the transfer of excess real property to other agencies at less than fair market value for continued public use is clearly justified as in the public interest and approved by FHWA under § 710.403(e), the deed shall provide for reversion of the property for failure to continue public ownership and use. Where property is sold at fair market value, no reversion clause is required.</P>
              <P>(e) No FHWA approval is required for disposal of excess real property located outside of the approved ROW limits or other project limits if Federal funds did not participate in the acquisition cost of the real property.</P>
              <P>(f) Highway facilities in which Federal funds participated in either the ROW or construction may be relinquished to another governmental agency for continued highway use under the provisions of 23 CFR part 620, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(g) A request for approval of a disposal must demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 710.403(a), (c), (d), (e), (f) and this section. An individual, company, organization, or public agency requesting a grantee to approve of a disposal of excess real property within the approved ROW limits or other project limits, or to approve of a disposal of excess real property outside the ROW limits that was acquired with title 23 of the United States Code funding, shall submit a written request to the grantee, together with an application supporting the proposal. If the FHWA is the approving authority, the grantee shall forward the request, the SDOT recommendation if the proposal affects a Federal-aid highway, the application, and proposed terms and conditions, together with its recommendation and any necessary supplemental information, to FHWA. The submission shall affirmatively provide for adherence to requirements contained in this section and must include the information specified in § 710.405(e)(1) through (9).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Early acquisition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A State agency may initiate acquisition of real property interests for a proposed transportation project at any time it has the legal authority to do so. The State agency may undertake Early Acquisition Projects before the completion of the environmental review process for the proposed transportation project for corridor preservation, access management, or other purposes. Subject to the requirements in this section, State agencies may fund Early Acquisition Project costs entirely with State funds with no title 23 participation; use State funds initially but seek title 23 credit or reimbursement when the acquired property is incorporated into a transportation project eligible for Federal surface transportation program funds; or use the normal Federal-aid project agreement and reimbursement process to fund an Early Acquisition Project pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The early acquisition of a real property interest under this section shall be carried out in compliance with all requirements applicable to the acquisition of real property interests for federally assisted transportation projects.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State-funded early acquisition without Federal credit or reimbursement.</E> A State agency may carry out early acquisition entirely at its expense and later incorporate the acquired real property into a transportation project or program for which the State agency receives Federal financial assistance or other Federal approval under title 23 for other transportation project activities. In order to maintain eligibility for future Federal assistance on the project, early acquisition activities funded entirely without Federal participation must comply with the requirements of § 710.501(c)(1) through (5).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">State-funded early acquisition eligible for future credit.</E> Subject to § 710.203(b) (direct eligible costs), § 710.505(b), and § 710.507 (State and local contributions), Early Acquisition <PRTPAGE P="485"/>Project costs incurred by a State agency at its own expense prior to completion of the environmental review process for a proposed transportation project are eligible for use as a credit toward the non-Federal share of the total project costs if the project receives surface transportation program funds, and if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The property was lawfully obtained by the State agency;</P>
              <P>(2) The property was not land described in 23 U.S.C. 138;</P>
              <P>(3) The property was acquired, and any relocations were carried out, in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Act and regulations in 49 CFR part 24;</P>
              <P>(4) The State agency complied with the requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4);</P>
              <P>(5) The State agency determined, and FHWA concurred, the early acquisition did not influence the environmental review process for the proposed transportation project, including:</P>
              <P>(i) The decision on need to construct the proposed transportation project;</P>
              <P>(ii) The consideration of any alternatives for the proposed transportation project required by applicable law; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The selection of the design or location for the proposed transportation project; and</P>
              <P>(6) The property will be incorporated into the project for which surface transportation program funds are received and to which the credit will be applied.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">State-funded early acquisition eligible for future reimbursement.</E> Early Acquisition Project costs incurred by a State agency prior to completion of the environmental review process for the transportation project are eligible for reimbursement from title 23 funds apportioned to the State once the real property interests are incorporated into a project eligible for surface transportation program funds if the State agency demonstrates, and FHWA concurs, that the terms and conditions specified in the requirements of § 710.501(c)(1) through (5), and the requirements of § 710.203(b) (direct eligible costs) have been met. The State agency must demonstrate that it has met the following requirements, as set forth in 23 U.S.C. 108(c)(3):</P>
              <P>(1) Any land acquired, and relocation assistance provided, complied with the Uniform Act;</P>
              <P>(2) The requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have been complied with;</P>
              <P>(3) The State has a mandatory comprehensive and coordinated land use, environment, and transportation planning process under State law and the acquisition is certified by the Governor as consistent with the State plans before the acquisition;</P>
              <P>(4) The acquisition is determined in advance by the Governor to be consistent with the State transportation planning process pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 135;</P>
              <P>(5) The alternative for which the real property interest is acquired is selected by the State pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary which provide for the consideration of the environmental impacts of various alternatives;</P>
              <P>(6) Before the time that the cost incurred by a State is approved for Federal participation, environmental compliance pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act has been completed for the project for which the real property interest was acquired by the State, and the acquisition has been approved by the Secretary under this Act, and in compliance with section 303 of title 49, section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and all other applicable environmental laws that shall be identified by the Secretary in regulations; and</P>
              <P>(7) Before the time that the cost incurred by a State is approved for Federal participation, the Secretary has determined that the property acquired in advance of Federal approval or authorization did not influence the environmental assessment of the project, the decision relative to the need to construct the project, or the selection of the project design or location.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Federally funded early acquisition.</E> The FHWA may authorize the use of funds apportioned to a State under title 23 for an Early Acquisition Project if the State agency certifies, and FHWA concurs, that all of the following conditions have been met:<PRTPAGE P="486"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The State has authority to acquire the real property interest under State law; and</P>
              <P>(2) The acquisition of the real property interest—</P>
              <P>(i) Is for a transportation project or program eligible for funding under title 23 that will not require FHWA approval under 23 CFR 774.3;</P>
              <P>(ii) Will not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts either as a result of the Early Acquisition Project or from cumulative effects of multiple Early Acquisition Projects carried out under this section in connection with a proposed transportation project;</P>
              <P>(iii) Will not limit the choice of reasonable alternatives for a proposed transportation project or otherwise influence the decision of FHWA on any approval required for a proposed transportation project;</P>
              <P>(iv) Will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept an alternative that is being considered in the environmental review process for a proposed transportation project;</P>
              <P>(v) Is consistent with the State transportation planning process under 23 U.S.C. 135;</P>
              <P>(vi) Complies with other applicable Federal laws (including regulations);</P>
              <P>(vii) Will be acquired through negotiation, without the threat of, or use of, condemnation; and</P>

              <P>(viii) Will not result in a reduction or elimination of benefits or assistance to a displaced person required by the Uniform Act and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(3) The Early Acquisition Project is included as a project in an applicable transportation improvement program under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135 and 49 U.S.C. 5303 and 5304.</P>
              <P>(4) The environmental review process for the Early Acquisition Project is complete and FHWA has approved the Early Acquisition Project. Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 108(d)(4)(B), the Early Acquisition Project is deemed to have independent utility for purposes of the environmental review process under NEPA. When the Early Acquisition Project may result in a change to the use or character of the real property interest prior to the completion of the environmental review process for the proposed transportation project, the NEPA evaluation for the Early Acquisition Project must consider whether the change has the potential to cause a significant environmental impact as defined in 40 CFR 1508.27, including a significant adverse impact within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. The Early Acquisition Project must comply with all applicable environmental laws.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Prohibited activities.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, real property interests acquired under paragraph (e) of this section and pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 108(d) cannot be developed in anticipation of a transportation project until all required environmental reviews for the transportation project have been completed. For the purpose of this paragraph, “development in anticipation of a transportation project” means any activity related to demolition, site preparation, or construction that is not necessary to protect public health or safety. With prior FHWA approval, a State agency may carry out limited activities necessary for securing real property interests acquired as part of an Early Acquisition Project, such as limited clearing and demolition activity, if the activities are necessary to protect the public health or safety and are considered during the environmental review of the Early Acquisition Project.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reimbursement.</E> If Federal-aid reimbursement is made for real property interests acquired early under this section and the real property interests are not subsequently incorporated into a project eligible for surface transportation funds within the time allowed by 23 U.S.C. 108 (a)(2), FHWA must offset the amount reimbursed against funds apportioned to the State.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Relocation assistance eligibility.</E> In the case of an Early Acquisition Project, a person is considered to be displaced when required to move from the real property as a direct result of a binding written agreement for the purchase of the real property interest(s) between the acquiring agency and the property owner. Options to purchase and similar agreements used for Early <PRTPAGE P="487"/>Acquisition Projects that give the acquiring agency a right to prevent new development or to decide in the future whether to acquire the real property interest(s), but do not create an immediate commitment by the acquiring agency to acquire and do not require an owner or tenant to relocate, do not create relocation eligibility until the acquiring agency legally commits itself to acquiring the real property interest(s).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General conditions.</E> Prior to final environmental approval of a transportation project, the grantee may request FHWA agreement to provide reimbursement for advance acquisition of a particular parcel or a limited number of parcels, to prevent imminent development and increased costs on the preferred location (Protective Buying), or to alleviate hardship to a property owner or owners on the preferred location (Hardship Acquisition), provided the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The transportation project is included in the currently approved STIP;</P>
              <P>(2) The grantee has complied with applicable public involvement requirements in 23 CFR parts 450 and 771;</P>
              <P>(3) A determination has been completed for any property interest subject to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 138; and</P>
              <P>(4) Procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation are completed for properties subject to (54 U.S.C. 306108), (historic properties).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Protective buying.</E> The grantee must clearly demonstrate that development of the property is imminent and such development would limit future transportation choices. A significant increase in cost may be considered as an element justifying a protective purchase.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hardship acquisitions.</E> The grantee must accept and concur in an owner's request for a hardship acquisition based on a property owner's written submission that—</P>
              <P>(1) Supports the hardship acquisition by providing justification, on the basis of health, safety or financial reasons, that remaining in the property poses an undue hardship compared to other property owners; and</P>
              <P>(2) Documents an inability to sell the property because of the impending project, at fair market value, within a time period that is typical for properties not impacted by the impending project.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental decisions.</E> Acquisition of property under this section is subject to environmental review under part 771 of this chapter. Acquisitions under this section shall not influence the environmental review of a transportation project which would use the property, including decisions about the need to construct the transportation project or the selection of an alternative.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Donations of property being acquired.</E> A non-governmental owner whose real property is required for a title 23 project may donate the property. Donations may be made at any time during the development of a project subject to applicable State laws. Prior to accepting the property, the owner must be informed in writing by the acquiring agency of his/her right to receive just compensation for the property, the right to an appraisal or waiver valuation of the real property, and of all other applicable financial and non-financial assistance provided under 49 CFR part 24 and applicable State law. All donations of property received prior to the approval of the NEPA document for the project must meet the requirements specified in 23 U.S.C. 323(d).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Credit for donations.</E> Donations of real property may be credited to the State's matching share of the project in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 323. As required by 23 U.S.C. 323(b)(2), credit to the State's matching share for donated property shall be based on fair market value established on the earlier of the following: Either the date on which the donation becomes effective, or the date on which equitable title to the property vests in the State. The fair market value shall not include increases or decreases in value caused by the project. The grantee shall ensure sufficient documentation is developed to indicate compliance with paragraph (a) of this section and with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 323, and to support the <PRTPAGE P="488"/>amount of credit applied. The total credit cannot exceed the State's pro-rata share under the project agreement to which it is applied.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Donations and conveyances in exchange for construction features or services.</E> A property owner may donate property in exchange for construction features or services. The value of the donation is limited to the fair market value of property donated less the cost of the construction features or services. If the value of the donated property exceeds the cost of the construction features or services, the difference may be eligible for a credit to the State's share of project costs.</P>

              <P>(6) A legal description of the lands desired; and</P>

              <P>(7) A statement of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and any other applicable Federal environmental laws, including the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 306108), and 23 U.S.C. 138.</P>
              <P>(e) If the FHWA concurs in the need for the transfer, the Federal land management agency will be notified and a right-of-entry requested. For projects not on the Interstate System, the Federal land management agency shall have a period of 4 months in which to designate conditions necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of the reserve or to certify that the proposed appropriation is contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the purposes for which such land or materials have been reserved. The FHWA may extend the reply period at the timely request of the Federal land management agency for good cause.</P>
              <P>(f) The FHWA may participate in the payment of fair market value or the functional replacement of impacted facilities under 710.509 and the reimbursement of the ordinary and reasonable direct costs of the Federal land management agency for the transfer when reimbursement is required by the Federal land management agency's governing laws as a condition of the transfer.</P>
              <P>(g) Deeds for conveyance of real property interests owned by the United States shall be prepared by the eligible party and must be certified as being legally sufficient by an attorney licensed within the State where the real property is located.

After the eligible party prepares the deed, it will submit the proposed deed with the certification to FHWA for review and execution.</P>
              <P>(h) Following execution by FHWA, the eligible party shall record the deed in the appropriate land record office and so advise FHWA and the affected Federal land management agency.</P>
              <P>(i) When the need for the interest acquired under this subpart no longer exists, the party that received the real property must restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the transfer, or to a condition that is acceptable to the Federal land management agency to which such property would revert, and must give notice to FHWA and to the affected Federal land management agency that such interest will immediately revert to the control of the Federal land management agency from which it was appropriated or to its assigns. Where authorized by Federal law, the Federal land management agency and such party may enter into a separate agreement to release the reversion clause and make alternative arrangements for the sale, restoration, or other disposition of the lands no longer needed.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 710.603</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Direct Federal acquisition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this paragraph may be applied to any real property that is not owned by the United States and is needed in connection with a project for the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of any section of the Interstate System or for a Defense Access Road project under 23 U.S.C. 210, if the SDOT is unable to acquire the required ROW or is unable to obtain possession with sufficient promptness. If the landowner tenders a right-of-entry or other right of possession document required by State law any time before FHWA makes a determination that the SDOT is unable to acquire the ROW with sufficient promptness, the SDOT is legally obligated to accept such tender and FHWA may not proceed with Federal acquisition. To enable FHWA to make the necessary findings and to proceed with the acquisition of the ROW, the SDOT's written application for Federal acquisition must include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Justification for the Federal acquisition of the lands or interests in lands;</P>

              <P>(2) The date FHWA authorized the SDOT to commence ROW acquisition, the date of the project agreement, and a statement that the agreement contains the provisions required by 23 U.S.C. 111;<PRTPAGE P="491"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The necessity for acquisition of the particular lands under request;</P>
              <P>(4) A statement of the specific interests in lands to be acquired, including the proposed treatment of control of access;</P>
              <P>(5) The SDOT's intentions with respect to the acquisition, subordination, or exclusion of outstanding interests, such as minerals and utility easements, in connection with the proposed acquisition;</P>
              <P>(6) A statement on compliance with the provisions of parts 771 and 774 of this chapter, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(7) Adequate legal descriptions, plats, appraisals, and title data;</P>
              <P>(8) An outline of the negotiations that have been conducted with landowners;</P>
              <P>(9) An agreement that the SDOT will pay its pro rata share of costs incurred in the acquisition of, or the attempt to acquire, ROW; and</P>
              <P>(10) A statement that assures compliance with the applicable provisions of the Uniform Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, direct Federal acquisitions from non-Federal owners for projects administered by the FHWA Office of Federal Lands Highway may be carried out in accordance with applicable Federal condemnation laws. The FHWA will proceed with such a direct Federal acquisition only when the public agency responsible for the road is unable to obtain the ROW necessary for the project. The public agency must make a written request to FHWA for the acquisition and, if the public agency is a Federal agency, the request shall include a commitment that any real property obtained will be under that agency's sole jurisdiction and control and FHWA will have no jurisdiction or control over the real property as a result of the acquisition. The FHWA may require the applicant to provide any information FHWA needs to make the required determinations or to carry out the acquisition.</P>
              <P>(c) If the applicant for direct Federal acquisition obtains title to a parcel prior to the filing of the Declaration of Taking, it shall notify FHWA and immediately furnish the appropriate U.S. Attorney with a disclaimer together with a request that the action against the landowner be dismissed (ex parte) from the proceeding and the estimated just compensation deposited into the registry of the court for the affected parcel be withdrawn after the appropriate motions are approved by the court.</P>
              <P>(d) When the United States obtains a court order granting possession of the real property, FHWA shall authorize the applicant for direct Federal acquisition to immediately take over supervision of the property. The authorization shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The right to take possession of unoccupied properties;</P>
              <P>(2) The right to give 90 days notice to owners to vacate occupied properties and the right to take possession of such properties when vacated;</P>
              <P>(3) The right to permit continued occupancy of a property until it is required for construction and, in those instances where such occupancy is to be for a substantial period of time, the right to enter into rental agreements, as appropriate, to protect the public interest;</P>
              <P>(4) The right to request assistance from the U.S. Attorney in obtaining physical possession where an owner declines to comply with the court order of possession;</P>
              <P>(5) The right to clear improvements and other obstructions;</P>
              <P>(6) Instructions that the U.S. Attorney be notified prior to actual clearing, so as to afford him an opportunity to view the lands and improvements, to obtain appropriate photographs, and to secure appraisals in connection with the preparation of the case for trial;</P>
              <P>(7) The requirement for appropriate credits to the United States for any net salvage or net rentals obtained by the applicant for direct Federal acquisition, as in the case of ROW acquired by an SDOT for Federal-aid projects; and</P>

              <P>(8) Instructions that the authority granted to the applicant for direct Federal acquisition is not intended to preclude the U.S. Attorney from taking action, before the applicant has made arrangements for removal, to reach a settlement with the former owner which would include provision for removal.<PRTPAGE P="492"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) If the Federal Government initiates condemnation proceedings against the owner of real property in a Federal court and the final judgment is that FHWA cannot acquire the real property by condemnation, or the proceeding is abandoned, the court is required by law to award such a sum to the owner of the real property that in the opinion of the court provides reimbursement for the owner's reasonable costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees, actually incurred because of the condemnation proceedings.</P>
              <P>(f) As soon as practicable after the date of payment of the purchase price or the date of deposit in court of funds to satisfy the award of the compensation in a Federal condemnation, FHWA shall reimburse the owner to the extent deemed fair and reasonable, the following costs:</P>
              <P>(1) Recording fees, transfer taxes, and similar expenses incidental to conveying such real property to the United States;</P>
              <P>(2) Penalty costs for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage entered into in good faith encumbering such real property; and</P>
              <P>(3) The pro rata portion of real property taxes paid which are allocable to a period subsequent to the date of vesting title in the United States or the effective date of possession, whichever is the earlier.</P>
              <P>(g) The lands or interests in lands, acquired under this section, will be conveyed to the State or the appropriate political subdivision thereof, upon agreement by the SDOT, or said subdivision to:</P>
              <P>(1) Maintain control of access where applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Accept title thereto;</P>
              <P>(3) Maintain the project constructed thereon;</P>
              <P>(4) Abide by any conditions which may set forth in the deed; and</P>
              <P>(5) Notify the FHWA at the appropriate time that all the conditions have been performed.</P>
              <P>(h) The deed from the United States to the State, or to the appropriate political subdivision thereof, or in the case of a Federal applicant for a direct Federal acquisition any document designating jurisdiction, shall include the conditions required by 49 CFR part 21 and shall not include any grant of jurisdiction to FHWA. The deed shall be recorded by the grantee in the appropriate land record office, and the FHWA shall be advised of the recording date.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe the standards that ensure fair market value is received by a highway agency under concession agreements involving federally funded highways.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As used in this subpart:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Best value</E> means the proposal offering the most overall public benefits as determined through an evaluation of the amount of the concession payment and other appropriate considerations. Such other appropriate considerations may include, but are not limited to, qualifications and experience of the concessionaire, expected quality of services to be provided, the history or track record of the concessionaire in providing the services, timelines for the delivery of services, performance standards, complexity of the services to be rendered, and revenue sharing. Such appropriate considerations may also include, but are not limited to, policy considerations that are important, but not quantifiable, such as retaining the ability to amend the concession agreement if conditions change, having a desired level of oversight over the facility, ensuring a certain level of maintenance and operations for the facility, considerations relative to the structure and amount of the toll rates, economic development impacts and considerations, or social and environmental benefits and impacts.<PRTPAGE P="493"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Concession agreement</E> means an agreement between a highway agency and a concessionaire under which the concessionaire is given the right to operate and collect revenues or fees for the use of a federally funded highway in return for compensation to be paid to the highway agency. A concession agreement may include, but not be limited to, obligations concerning the development, design, construction, maintenance, operation, level of service, and/or capital improvements to a facility over the term of the agreement. Concession agreement shall not include agreements between government entities, even when compensation is paid, where the primary purpose of the transaction is not commercial in nature but for the purpose of determining governmental ownership, control, jurisdiction, or responsibilities with respect to the operation of a federally funded highway. The highway agency's determination as to whether an agreement between government entities constitutes a concession agreement shall be controlling.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Concessionaire</E> means any private or public entity that enters into a concession agreement with a highway agency.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fair market value</E> means the price at which a highway agency and concessionaire are ready and willing to enter into a concession agreement for a federally funded highway on, or as if in, the open market for a reasonable period of time and in an arm's length transaction to any willing, knowledgeable, and able buyer. For purposes of this subpart, a concession agreement based on best value shall be deemed fair market value.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Federally funded highway</E> means any highway (including highways, bridges, and tunnels) acquired with Federal assistance made available from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account). A highway shall be deemed to be acquired with Federal assistance if Federal assistance participated in either the purchase of any real property, or in any capital expenditures in any fixtures located on real property, within the right-of-way, including the highway and any structures located upon the property.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Highway agency</E> in this subpart means any SDOT or other public authority with jurisdiction over a federally funded highway.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This subpart applies to all concession agreements involving federally funded highways that are executed after January 18, 2009.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 710.707</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Fair market value.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A highway agency shall receive fair market value for any concession agreement involving a federally funded highway.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 710.709</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Determination of fair market value.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Fair market value may be determined either on a best value basis, highest net present value of the payments to be received over the life of the agreement, or highest bid received, as may be specified by the highway agency in the request for proposals or other relevant solicitation. If best value is used, the highway agency should identify, in the relevant solicitation, the criteria to be used as well as the weight afforded to the criteria.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to be considered fair market value, the terms of the concession agreement must be both legally binding and enforceable.</P>

              <P>(c) Any concession agreement awarded pursuant to a competitive process with more than one bidder shall be deemed to be fair market value. Any concession agreement awarded pursuant to a competitive process with only one bidder shall be presumed to be fair market value. Such presumption may be overcome only if the highway agency determines the proposal to not be fair market value based on the highway agency's estimates. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to require a highway agency to accept any proposal, even if the proposal is deemed fair market value. For purposes of this subsection, a competitive process shall afford all interested proposers an equal opportunity to submit a proposal for the concession agreement and shall comply with applicable State and local law.<PRTPAGE P="494"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) If a concession agreement is not awarded pursuant to a competitive process, the highway agency must receive fair market value, as determined by the highway agency in accordance with State law, so long as an independent third party assessment is conducted and made publicly available.</P>
              <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart is intended to waive the requirements of part 172, part 635, and part 636 whenever any Federal-aid (including TIFIA assistance) is to be used for a project under the concession agreement.</P>

              <P>(a) Just compensation shall be paid for the rights and interests of the sign and site owner in those outdoor advertising signs, displays, or devices which are lawfully existing under State law, in conformance with the terms of 23 U.S.C. 131.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Federal reimbursement will be made on the basis of 75 percent of the acquisition, removal and incidental costs legally incurred or obligated by the State.</P>
              <P>(2) Federal funds will participate in 100 percent of the costs of removal of those signs which were removed prior to January 4, 1975, by relocation, pursuant to the provisions of 23 CFR § 750.305(a)(2), and which are required to be removed as a result of the amendments made to 23 U.S.C. 131 by the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-643, section 109, January 4, 1975.

This statement should be supported by the State's regulations implementing its program. Revisions to the State's policies and procedures shall be submitted to the FHWA for approval. The statement should contain provisions for the review of its policies and procedure to meet changing conditions, adoption of improved procedures, and for internal review to assure compliance. The statement shall include as a minimum the following:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Project priorities.</E> The following order of priorities is recommended.</P>
              <P>(1) Illegal and abandoned signs.</P>
              <P>(2) Hardship situations.</P>
              <P>(3) Nominal value signs.</P>
              <P>(4) Signs in areas which have been designated as scenic under authority of State law.</P>
              <P>(5) Product advertising on:</P>
              <P>(i) Rural interstate highway.</P>
              <P>(ii) Rural primary highway.</P>
              <P>(iii) Urban areas.</P>
              <P>(6) Nontourist-oriented directional advertising.</P>
              <P>(7) Tourist-oriented directional advertising.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Programing.</E> (1) A sign removal project may consist of any group of proposed sign removals. The signs may be those belonging to one company or those located along a single route, all of the signs in a single county or other locality, hardship situations, individually or grouped, such as those involving vandalized signs, or all of a sign owner's signs in a given State or area, or any similar grouping.</P>
              <P>(2) A project for sign removal on other than a Federal-aid primary route basis e.g., a countywide project or a project involving only signs owned by one company, should be identified as CAF-000B( ), continuing the numbering sequence which began with the sign inventory project in 1966.</P>
              <P>(3) Where it would not interfere with the State's operations, the State should program sign removal projects to minimize disruption of business.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Valuation and review methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">Schedules—formulas.</E> Schedules, formulas or other methods to simplify valuation of signs and sites are recommended for the purpose of minimizing administrative and legal expenses necessarily involved in determining just compensation by individual appraisals and litigation. They do not purport to be a basis for the determination of just compensation under eminent domain.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Appraisals.</E> Where appropriate, the State may use its approved appraisal report forms including those for abbreviated or short form appraisals. Where a sign or site owner does not accept the amount computed under an approved schedule, formula, or other simplified method, an appraisal shall be utilized.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Leaseholds.</E> When outdoor advertising signs and sign sites involve a leasehold value, the State's procedures should provide for determining value in the same manner as any other real estate leasehold that has value to the lessee.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Severance damages.</E> The State has the responsibility of justifying the recognition of severance damages pursuant to 23 CFR 710.304(h), and the law of the State before Federal participation will be allowed. Generally, Federal participation will not be allowed in the payment of severance damages to remaining signs, or other property of a sign company alleged to be due to the taking of certain of the company's signs. Unity of use of the separate properties, as required by applicable principles of eminent domain law, must be shown to exist before participation in severance damages will be allowed. Moreover, the value of the remaining signs or other real property <PRTPAGE P="504"/>must be diminished by virtue of the taking of such signs. Payments for severance damages to economic plants or loss of business profits are not compensable. Severance damage cases must be submitted to the FHWA for prior concurrence, together with complete legal and appraisal justification for payment of these damages. To assist the FHWA in its evaluation, the following data will accompany any submission regarding severance:</P>
              <P>(i) One copy of each appraisal in which this was analyzed. One copy of the State's review appraiser analysis and determination of market value.</P>
              <P>(ii) A plan or map showing the location of each sign.</P>
              <P>(iii) An opinion by the State highway department's chief legal officer that severance is appropriate in accordance with State law together with a legal opinion that, in the instant case, the damages constitute severance as opposed to consequential damage as a matter of law. The opinion shall include a determination, and the basis therefor, that the specific taking of some of an outdoor advertiser's signs constitutes a distinct economic unit, and that unity of use of the separate properties in conformity with applicable principles of eminent domain law had been satisfactorily established. A legal memorandum must be furnished citing and discussing cases and other authorities supporting the State's position.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Review of value estimates.</E> All estimates of value shall be reviewed by a person other than the one who made the estimate. Appraisal reports shall be reviewed and approved prior to initiation of negotiations. All other estimates shall be reviewed before the agreement becomes final.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Nominal value plan.</E> (1) This plan may provide for the removal costs of eligible nominal value signs and for payments up to $250 for each nonconforming sign, and up to $100 for each nonconforming sign site.</P>
              <P>(2) The State's procedures may provide for negotiations for sign sites and sign removals to be accomplished simultaneously without prior review.</P>
              <P>(3) Releases or agreements executed by the sign and/or site owner should include the identification of the sign, statement of ownership, price to be paid, interest acquired, and removal rights.</P>
              <P>(4) It is not expected that salvage value will be a consideration in most acquisitions; however, the State's procedures may provide that the sign may be turned over to the sign owner, site owner, contractor, or individual as all or a part of the consideration for its removal, without any project credits.</P>
              <P>(5) Programing and authorizations will be in accord with § 750.308 of this regulation. A detailed estimate of value of each individual sign is not necessary. The project may be programed and authorized as one project.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Sign removal.</E> The State's procedural statement should include provision for:</P>
              <P>(1) Owner retention.</P>
              <P>(2) Salvage value.</P>
              <P>(3) State removal.</P>

              <P>(3) A duplicate payment for the site owner's interest of $2,500 or less because of a bona fide error in ownership, provided the State has followed its title search procedures as set forth in its policy and procedure submission.</P>

              <P>(4) The cost of removal of signs, partially completed sign structures, supporting poles, abandoned signs and those which are illegal under State law within the controlled areas, provided such costs are incurred in accordance with State law. Removal may be by State personnel on a force account basis or by contract. Documentation for Federal participation in such removal projects should be in accord with the State's normal force account <PRTPAGE P="505"/>and contractual reimbursement procedures. The State should maintain a record of the number of signs removed. These data should be retained in project records and reported on the periodic report required under § 750.308 of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(5) Signs materially damaged by vandals. Federal funds shall be limited to the Federal pro-rata share of the fair market value of the sign immediately before the vandalism occurred minus the estimated cost of repairing and reerecting the sign. If the State chooses, it may use its FHWA approved nominal value plan procedure to acquire these signs.</P>

The evidence considered by the State as acceptable for establishing or showing that the nonconforming use has not been abandoned or voluntarily discontinued shall be set forth in the State's policy and procedures.</P>
              <P>(7) In the event a sign was omitted in the 1966 inventory, and the State supports a determination that the sign was in existence prior to October 22, 1965, the costs are eligible for Federal participation.</P>
              <P>(b) Federal funds may not participate in:</P>
              <P>(1) Cost of title certificates, title insurance, title opinion or similar evidence or proof of title in connection with the acquisition of a landowner's right to erect and maintain a sign or signs when the amount of payment to the landowner for his interest is $2,500 or less, unless required by State law. However, Federal funds may participate in the costs of securing some lesser evidence or proof of title such as searches and investigations by State highway department personnel to the extent necessary to determine ownership, affidavit of ownership by the owner, bill of sale, etc. The State's procedure for determining evidence of title should be set forth in the State's policy and procedure submission.</P>
              <P>(2) Payments to a sign owner where the sign was erected without permission of the property owner unless the sign owner can establish his legal right to erect and maintain the sign. However, such signs may be removed by State personnel on a force account basis or by contract with Federal participation except where the sign owner reimburses the State for removal.</P>
              <P>(3) Acquisition costs paid for abandoned or illegal signs, potential sign sites, or signs which were built during a period of time which makes them ineligible for compensation under 23 U.S.C. 131, or for rights in sites on which signs have been abandoned or illegally erected by a sign owner.</P>
              <P>(4) The acquisition cost of supporting poles or partially completed sign structures in nonconforming areas which do not have advertising or informative content thereon unless the owner can show to the State's satisfaction he has not abandoned the structure. When the State has determined the sign structure has not been abandoned, Federal funds will participate in the acquisition of the structure, provided the cost are incurred in accordance with State law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) may approve a State's request to exempt certain nonconforming signs, displays, and devices (hereinafter called signs) within a defined area from being acquired under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 131 upon a showing that removal would work a substantial economic hardship throughout that area. A defined area is an area with clearly established geographical boundaries defined by the State which the State can evaluate as an economic entity. Neither the States nor FHWA shall rely on individual claims of economic hardship. Exempted signs must:</P>
              <P>(1) Have been lawfully erected prior to May 5, 1976, and must continue to be lawfully maintained.</P>
              <P>(2) Continue to provide the directional information to goods and services offered at the same enterprise in the defined area in the interest of the traveling public that was provided on May 5, 1976. Repair and maintenance of these signs shall conform with the State's approved maintenance standards as required by subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) To obtain the exemption permitted by 23 U.S.C. 131(o), the State shall establish:</P>
              <P>(1) Its requirements for the directional content of signs to qualify the signs as directional signs to goods and services in the defined area.</P>

              <P>(2) A method of economic analysis clearly showing that the removal of <PRTPAGE P="507"/>signs would work a substantial economic hardship throughout the defined area.</P>
              <P>(c) In support of its request for exemption, the State shall submit to the FHWA:</P>
              <P>(1) Its requirements and method (see § 750.503(b)).</P>
              <P>(2) The limits of the defined area(s) requested for exemption, a listing of signs to be exempted, their location, and the name of the enterprise advertised on May 5, 1976.</P>
              <P>(3) The application of the requirements and method to the defined areas, demonstrating that the signs provide directional information to goods and services of interest to the traveling public in the defined area, and that removal would work a substantial economic hardship in the defined area(s).</P>
              <P>(4) A statement that signs in the defined area(s) not meeting the exemption requirements will be removed in accordance with State law.</P>
              <P>(5) A statement that the defined area will be reviewed and evaluated at least every three (3) years to determine if an exemption is still warranted.</P>
              <P>(d) The FHWA, upon receipt of a State's request for exemption, shall prior to approval:</P>
              <P>(1) Review the State's requirements and methods for compliance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 131 and this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Review the State's request and the proposed exempted area for compliance with State requirements and methods.</P>
              <P>(e) Nothing herein shall prohibit the State from acquiring signs in the defined area at the request of the sign owner.</P>
              <P>(f) Nothing herein shall prohibit the State from imposing or maintaining stricter requirements.</P>

              <P>(3) If the zoning authority has been delegated, extraterritorial, jurisdiction under State law, and exercises control of outdoor advertising in commercial and industrial zones within this extraterritorial jurisdiction, control by the zoning authority may be accepted in lieu of agreement controls in such areas.</P>

              <P>(4) The State shall notify the FHWA in writing of those zoning jurisdictions wherein local control applies. It will not be necessary to furnish a copy of <PRTPAGE P="510"/>the zoning ordinance. The State shall periodically assure itself that the size, lighting, and spacing control provisions of zoning ordinances accepted under this section are actually being enforced by the local authorities.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 750.707</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Nonconforming signs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The provisions of § 750.707 apply to nonconforming signs which must be removed under State laws and regulations implementing 23 U.S.C. 131. These provisions also apply to nonconforming signs located in commercial and industrial areas within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way which come under the so-called grandfather clause contained in State-Federal agreements. These provisions do not apply to conforming signs regardless of when or where they are erected.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonconforming signs.</E> A nonconforming sign is a sign which was lawfully erected but does not comply with the provisions of State law or State regulations passed at a later date or later fails to comply with State law or State regulations due to changed conditions. Changed conditions include, for example, signs lawfully in existence in commercial areas which at a later date become noncommercial, or signs lawfully erected on a secondary highway later classified as a primary highway.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grandfather clause.</E> At the option of the State, the agreement may contain a grandfather clause under which criteria relative to size, lighting, and spacing of signs in zoned and unzoned commercial and industrial areas within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way apply only to new signs to be erected after the date specified in the agreement. Any sign lawfully in existence in a commercial or industrial area on such date may remain even though it may not comply with the size, lighting, or spacing criteria. This clause only allows an individual sign at its particular location for the duration of its normal life subject to customary maintenance. Preexisting signs covered by a grandfather clause, which do not comply with the agreement criteria have the status of nonconforming signs.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maintenance and continuance.</E> In order to maintain and continue a nonconforming sign, the following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The sign must have been actually in existence at the time the applicable State law or regulations became effective as distinguished from a contemplated use such as a lease or agreement with the property owner. There are two exceptions to actual existence as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Where a permit or similar specific State governmental action was granted for the construction of a sign prior to the effective date of the State law or regulations and the sign owner acted in good faith and expended sums in reliance thereon. This exception shall not apply in instances where large numbers of permits were applied for and issued to a single sign owner, obviously in anticipation of the passage of a State control law.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the State outdoor advertising control law or the Federal-State agreement provides that signs in commercial and industrial areas may be erected within six (6) months after the effective date of the law or agreement provided a lease dated prior to such effective date was filed with the State and recorded within thirty (30) days following such effective date.</P>
              <P>(2) There must be existing property rights in the sign affected by the State law or regulations. For example, paper signs nailed to trees, abandoned signs and the like are not protected.</P>
              <P>(3) The sign may be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred without affecting its status, but its location may not be changed. A nonconforming sign removed as a result of a right-of-way taking or for any other reason may be relocated to a conforming area but cannot be reestablished at a new location as a nonconforming use.</P>
              <P>(4) The sign must have been lawful on the effective date of the State law or regulations, and must continue to be lawfully maintained.</P>

              <P>(5) The sign must remain substantially the same as it was on the effective date of the State law or regulations. Reasonable repair and maintenance of the sign, including a change of <PRTPAGE P="511"/>advertising message, is not a change which would terminate nonconforming rights. Each State shall develop its own criteria to determine when customary maintenance ceases and a substantial change has occurred which would terminate nonconforming rights.</P>
              <P>(6) The sign may continue as long as it is not destroyed, abandoned, or discontinued. If permitted by State law and reerected in kind, exception may be made for signs destroyed due to vandalism and other criminal or tortious acts.</P>
              <P>(i) Each state shall develop criteria to define destruction, abandonment and discontinuance. These criteria may provide that a sign which for a designated period of time has obsolete advertising matter or is without advertising matter or is in need of substantial repair may constitute abandonment or discontinuance. Similarly, a sign damaged in excess of a certain percentage of its replacement cost may be considered destroyed.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where an existing nonconforming sign ceases to display advertising matter, a reasonable period of time to replace advertising content must be established by each State. Where new content is not put on a structure within the established period, the use of the structure as a nonconforming outdoor advertising sign is terminated and shall constitute an abandonment or discontinuance. Where a State establishes a period of more than one (1) year as a reasonable period for change of message, it shall justify that period as a customary enforcement practice within the State. This established period may be waived for an involuntary discontinuance such as the closing of a highway for repair in front of the sign.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Just compensation.</E> The States are required to pay just compensation for the removal of nonconforming lawfully existing signs in accordance with the terms of 23 U.S.C. 131 and the provisions of subpart D, part 750, chapter I, 23 CFR. The conditions which establish a right to maintain a nonconforming sign and therefore the right to compensation must pertain at the time it is acquired or removed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Acceptance of state zoning.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) 23 U.S.C. 131(d) provide that signs “may be erected and maintained within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way within areas . . . which are zoned industrial or commercial under authority of State law.” Section 131(d) further provides, “The States shall have full authority under their own zoning laws to zone areas for commercial or industrial purposes, and the actions of the States in this regard will be accepted for the purposes of this Act.”</P>
              <P>(b) State and local zoning actions must be taken pursuant to the State's zoning enabling statute or constitutional authority and in accordance therewith. Action which is not a part of comprehensive zoning and is created primarily to permit outdoor advertising structures, is not recognized as zoning for outdoor advertising control purposes.</P>
              <P>(c) Where a unit of government has not zoned in accordance with statutory authority or is not authorized to zone, the definition of an unzoned commercial or industrial area in the State-Federal agreement will apply within that political subdivision or area.</P>
              <P>(d) A zone in which limited commercial or industrial activities are permitted as an incident to other primary land uses is not considered to be a commercial or industrial zone for outdoor advertising control purposes.</P>

              <P>(a) A sign which consists solely of the name of the establishment or which identifies the establishment's principal or accessory products or services offered on the property is an on-property sign.</P>
              <P>(b) When a sign consists principally of brand name or trade name advertising and the product or service advertised is only incidental to the principal activity, or if it brings rental income to the property owner, it shall be considered the business of outdoor advertising and not an on-property sign.</P>

              <P>(c) A sale or lease sign which also advertises any product or service not conducted upon and unrelated to the business or selling or leasing the land on <PRTPAGE P="512"/>which the sign is located is not an on-property sign.</P>
              <P>(d) Signs are exempt from control under 23 U.S.C. 131 if they solely advertise the sale or lease of property on which they are located or advertise activities conducted on the property on which they are located. These signs are subject to regulation (subpart A, part 750, chapter I, 23 CFR) in those States which have executed a bonus agreement, 23 U.S.C. 131(j). State laws or regulations shall contain criteria for determining exemptions. These criteria may include:</P>
              <P>(1) A property test for determining whether a sign is located on the same property as the activity or property advertised; and</P>
              <P>(2) A purpose test for determining whether a sign has as its sole purpose the identification of the activity located on the property or its products or services, or the sale or lease of the property on which the sign is located.</P>
              <P>(3) The criteria must be sufficiently specific to curb attempts to improperly qualify outdoor advertising as “on-property” signs, such as signs on narrow strips of land contiguous to the advertised activity when the purpose is clearly to circumvent 23 U.S.C. 131.</P>

              <P>(a) 23 U.S.C. 131(c) permits the existence of signs lawfully in existence on October 22, 1965, determined by the State, subject to the approval of the Secretary, to be landmark signs, including signs on farm structures or natural surfaces, of historic or artistic significance, the preservation of which is consistent with the purpose of 23 U.S.C. 131.</P>
              <P>(b) States electing to permit landmark signs under 23 U.S.C. 131(c) shall submit a one-time list to the Federal Highway Administration for approval. The list should identify each sign as being in the original 1966 inventory. In the event a sign was omitted in the 1966 inventory, the State may submit other evidence to support a determination that the sign was in existence on October 22, 1965.</P>
              <P>(c) Reasonable maintenance, repair, and restoration of a landmark sign is permitted. Substantial change in size, lighting, or message content will terminate its exempt status.</P>

Bonus States are not exempt from the other provisions of 23 U.S.C. 131. If a State elects to comply with both programs, it must extend controls to the Primary System, and continue to carry out its bonus agreement along the Interstate System except where 23 U.S.C. 131, as amended, imposes more stringent requirements.</P>

            <P>(a) Emphasis should be placed on encouraging recycling of scrap and junk where practicable, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
            <P>(b) Every effort should be made to screen nonconforming junkyards which are to continue as ongoing businesses; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Junkyard.</E> (1) A Junkyard is an establishment or place of business which is maintained, operated or used for storing, keeping, buying, or selling junk, or for the maintenance or operation of an automobile graveyard. This definition includes scrap metal processors, auto-wrecking yards, salvage yards, scrap yards, autorecycling yards, used auto parts yards and temporary storage of automobile bodies and parts awaiting disposal as a normal part of a business operation when the business will continually have like materials located on the premises. The definition includes garbage dumps and sanitary landfills. The definition does not include litter, trash, and other debris scattered along or upon the highway, or temporary operations and outdoor storage of limited duration.</P>
            <P>(2) An Automobile Graveyard is an establishment or place of business which is maintained, used, or operated for storing, keeping, buying, or selling wrecked, scrapped, ruined, or dismantled motor vehicles or motor vehicle parts. Ten or more such vehicles will constitute an automobile graveyard.</P>
            <P>(3) An Illegal Junkyard is one which was established or is maintained in violation of State law.</P>
            <P>(4) A Nonconforming Junkyard is one which was lawfully established, but which does not comply with the provisions of State law or State regulations passed at a later date or which later fails to comply with State regulations due to changed conditions. Illegally established junkyards are not nonconforming junkyards.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Junk.</E> Old or scrap metal, rope, rags, batteries, paper, trash, rubber, debris, waste, or junked, dismantled, or wrecked automobiles, or parts thereof.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Main traveled way.</E> The traveled way of a highway on which through traffic is carried. In the case of a divided highway, the traveled way of each of the separated roadways for traffic in opposite directions is a main traveled way. It does not include such facilities as frontage roads, turning roadways, or parking areas.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Industrial zones.</E> Those districts established by zoning authorities as being most appropriate for industry or manufacturing. A zone which simply permits certain industrial activities as an incident to the primary land use designation is not considered to be an industrial zone. The provisions of part 750, subpart G of this chapter relative to Outdoor Advertising Control shall <PRTPAGE P="514"/>apply insofar as industrial zones are concerned.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Unzoned industrial areas.</E> An area where there is no zoning in effect and which is used primarily for industrial purposes as determined by the State and approved by the FHWA. An unzoned area cannot include areas which may have a rural zoning classification or land uses established by zoning variances or special exceptions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Effective control.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In order to provide effective control of junkyards located within 1,000 feet of Interstate and Federal-aid primary highways, the State must:</P>
            <P>(1) Require such junkyards located outside of zoned and unzoned industrial areas to be screened or located so as not to be visible from the main traveled way, or be removed from sight.</P>
            <P>(2) Require the screening or removal of nonconforming junkyards within a reasonable time, but no later than 5 years after the date the junkyard becomes nonconforming unless Federal funds are not available in adequate amounts to participate in the cost of such screening or removal as provided in 23 U.S.C. 136(j).</P>
            <P>(3) Prohibit the establishment of new junkyards unless they comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) Expeditiously require junkyards which are illegally established or maintained to conform to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) Sanitary landfills as described herein need not be screened to satisfy requirements of Title 23, U.S.C., but landscaping should be required when the fill has been completed and operations have ceased, unless the landfill area is to be used for immediate development purposes. A sanitary landfill, for the purposes of this part, is a method of disposing of refuse on land without creating a nuisance or hazards to public health or safety by utilizing the principles of engineering to confine the refuse to the smallest practical area, to reduce it to the smallest practical volume, and to cover it with a layer of earth at the conclusion of each day's operation or at such more frequent intervals as may be necessary.</P>
            <P>(c) The State shall have laws, rules, and procedures sufficient to provide effective control, to discover illegally established or maintained junkyards shortly after such occurrence, and to cause the compliance or removal of same promptly in accordance with State legal procedures.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Nonconforming junkyards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Subject to the provisions of § 751.9 of this part, the following requirements for the maintenance and continuance of a nonconforming junkyard apply:</P>
            <P>(a) The junkyard must have been actually in existence at the time the State law or regulations became effective as distinguished from a contemplated use, except where a permit or similar specific State governmental action was granted for the establishment of a junkyard prior to the effective date of the State law or regulations, and the junkyard owner acted in good faith and expended sums in reliance thereon.</P>
            <P>(b) There must be existing property rights in the junkyard or junk affected by the State law or regulation. Abandoned junk and junkyards, worthless junk, and the like are not similarly protected.</P>
            <P>(c) If the location of a nonconforming junkyard is changed as a result of a right-of-way taking or for any other reason, it ceases to be a nonconforming junkyard, and shall be treated as a new junkyard at a new location.</P>
            <P>(d) The nonconforming junkyard must have been lawful on the effective date of the State law or regulations and must continue to be lawfully maintained.</P>
            <P>(e) The nonconforming junkyard may continue as long as it is not extended, enlarged, or changed in use. Once a junkyard has been made conforming, the placement of junk so that it may be seen above or beyond a screen, or otherwise becomes visible, shall be treated the same as the establishment of a new junkyard.</P>
            <P>(f) The nonconforming junkyard may continue as long as it is not abandoned, destroyed, or voluntarily discontinued. Each State should develop criteria to define these terms.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Control measures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Consistent with the goals of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321), recycling of junk and scrap is to be encouraged to the greatest extent practicable in the implementation of the junkyard control program. Recycling should be considered in conjunction with other control measures. To facilitate recycling, junk or scrap should be moved to an automobile wrecker, or a scrap processor, or put to some other useful purpose.</P>
            <P>(b) Every effort shall be made to screen where the junkyard is to continue as an ongoing business. Screening may be accomplished by use of natural objects, landscaping plantings, fences, and other appropriate means, including relocating inventory on site to utilize an existing natural screen or a screenable portion of the site.</P>
            <P>(c) Where screening is used, it must, upon completion of the screening project, effectively screen the junkyard from the main traveled way of the highway on a year-round basis, and be compatible with the surroundings. Each State shall establish criteria governing the location, design, construction, maintenance, and materials used in fencing or screening.</P>
            <P>(d) A junkyard should be relocated only when other control measures are not feasible. Junkyards should be relocated to a site not visible from the highway or to an industrial area, and should not be relocated to residential, commercial, or other areas where foreseeable environmental problems may develop.</P>

            <P>(a) Just compensation shall be paid the owner for the relocation, removal, or disposal of junkyards lawfully established under State law, which are required to be removed, relocated, or disposed of pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 136.</P>
            <P>(b) No rights to compensation accrue until a taking or removal has occurred.

            <SUBJECT>Federal participation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Federal funds may participate in 75 percent of the costs of control measures incurred in carrying out the provisions of this part including necessary studies for particular projects, and the employment of fee landscape architects and other qualified consultants.</P>
            <P>(b) Where State control standards are more stringent than Federal control requirements along Interstate and primary highways, the FHWA may approve Federal participation in the costs of applying the State standards on a statewide basis. Where State standards require control of junkyards in zoned or unzoned industrial areas, Federal funds may participate only if such action will make an effective contribution to the character of the area as a whole and the cost is reasonable, but such projects should be deferred until the work in the areas where control is required has progressed well toward completion.</P>
            <P>(c) Generally, only costs associated with the acquisition of minimal real property interests, such as easements or temporary rights of entry, necessary to accomplish the purposes of this part are eligible for Federal participation. The State may request, on a case-by-case basis, participation in costs of other interests beyond the minimum necessary, including fee title.</P>
            <P>(d) Federal funds may participate in costs to correct the inadequacies of screening in prior control projects where the inadequacy is due to higher screening standards established in this part or due to changed conditions.</P>

            <P>(e) Federal funds may participate in the costs of moving junk or scrap to a recycling place of business, or in the case of junk with little or no recycling potential, to a site for permanent disposal. In the latter case, reasonable land rehabilitation costs or fees connected with the use of such a disposal site are also eligible. In a case where the acquisition of a permanent disposal site by the State would be the most economical method of disposal, Federal funds may participate in the net cost (cost of acquisition less a credit after <PRTPAGE P="516"/>disposal) of a site obtained for this purpose.</P>
            <P>(f) Federal funds may participate in control measure costs involved in any junkyard lawfully established or maintained under State law which is reclassified from conforming to nonconforming under revised State regulations and policy pursuant to this part.</P>
            <P>(g) Federal funds may participate in the costs of acquisition of a dwelling in exceptional cases where such acquisition is found necessary and in the public interest, and where acquisition of the dwelling can be accomplished without resort to eminent domain.</P>
            <P>(h) Federal funds shall not participate in:</P>
            <P>(1) Costs associated with the control of illegal junkyards except for removal by State personnel on a force account basis or by contract, or in costs of controlling junkyards established after the effective date of the State's compliance law except where a conforming junkyard later becomes nonconforming due to changed conditions;</P>
            <P>(2) Any costs associated with the acquisition of any dwelling or its related buildings if acquired through eminent domain in connection with the junkyard control program;</P>
            <P>(3) Costs of acquisition of interests or rights as a measure for prohibition or control of the establishment of future junkyards;</P>
            <P>(4) Costs of maintaining screening devices after they have been erected; or</P>
            <P>(5) Costs of screening junk which has been or will be removed as a part of a junkyard control project.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Highway esthetics is a most important consideration in the Federal-aid highway program. Highways must not only blend with our natural social, and cultural environment, but also provide pleasure and satisfaction in their use.</P>
            <P>(b) The FHWA will cooperate with State and local agencies and organizations to provide opportunities for the display of original works of art within the highway rights-of-way.</P>
            <P>(c) The development of the roadside to include landscape development, safety rest areas, and the preservation of valuable adjacent scenic lands is a necessary component of highway development. Planning and development of the roadside should be concurrent with or closely follow that of the highway. Further, the development of travel information centers and systems is encouraged as an effective method of providing necessary information to the traveling public.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Safety rest areas.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Safety rest areas should provide facilities reasonably necessary for the comfort, convenience, relaxation, and information needs of the motorist. Caretakers' quarters may be provided in conjunction with a safety rest area at such locations where accommodations are deemed necessary. All facilities within the rest area are to provide full consideration and accommodation for the handicapped.</P>
            <P>(b) The State may permit the placement of vending machines in existing or new safety rest areas located on the rights-of-way of the Interstate system for the purpose of dispensing such food, drink, or other articles as the State determines are appropriate and desirable, except that the dispensing by any means, of petroleum products or motor vehicle replacement parts shall not be allowed. Such vending machines shall be operated by the State.</P>
            <P>(c) The State may operate the vending machines directly or may contract with a vendor for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the vending machines. In permitting the placement of vending machines the State shall give priority to vending machines which are operated through the State licensing agency designated pursuant to section 2(a)(5) of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, U.S.C. 107(a)(5).</P>
            <P>(d) Access from the safety rest areas to adjacent publicly owned conservation and recreation areas may be permitted if access to these areas is only available through the rest area and if these areas or their usage does not adversely affect the facilities of the safety rest area.</P>
            <P>(e) The scenic quality of the site, its accessibility and adaptability, and the availability of utilities are the prime considerations in the selection of rest area sites. A statewide safety rest area system plan should be maintained. This plan should include development priorities to ensure safety rest areas will be constructed first at locations most needed by the motorist. Proposals for safety rest areas or similar facilities on Federal-aid highways in suburban or urban areas shall be special case and must be fully justified before being authorized by the FHWA Regional Administrator.</P>
            <P>(f) Facilities within newly constructed safety rest areas should meet the forecast needs of the design year. Expansion and modernization of older existing rest areas that do not provide adequate service should be considered.</P>
            <P>(g) No charge to the public may be made for goods and services at safety rest areas except for telephone and articles dispensed by vending machines.</P>

            <P>(7) The center or system shall be adequately maintained and kept clean and sanitary.</P>
            <P>(8) The State may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations on the conduct of the information center or system in the interests of the public.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part prescribes the policies and procedures of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as amended (NEPA), and supplements the NEPA regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508 (CEQ regulations). Together these regulations set forth all FHWA, FRA, FTA, and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements under NEPA for the processing of highway, public transportation, and railroad actions. This part also sets forth procedures to comply with 23 U.S.C. 109(h), 128, 138, 139, 325, 326, and 327; 49 U.S.C. 303; 49 U.S.C. 24201; and 5323(q); Public Law 112-141, 126 Stat. 405, section 1301 as applicable; and Public Law 114-94, 129 Stat. 1312, section 1304.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>It is the policy of the Administration that:</P>
            <P>(a) To the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law, all environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations be coordinated as a single process, and compliance with all applicable environmental requirements be reflected in the environmental review document required by this part.<SU>1</SU>

            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>1</SU> FHWA, FRA, and FTA have supplementary guidance on environmental documents and procedures for their programs available on the internet at <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov</E>, <E T="03">http://www.fra.dot.gov</E>, and <E T="03">http://www.fta.dot.gov</E>, or in hardcopy by request.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(b) Programmatic approaches be developed for compliance with environmental requirements (including the requirements found at 23 U.S.C. 139(b)(3)), coordination among agencies and/or the public, or to otherwise enhance and accelerate project development.</P>
            <P>(c) Alternative courses of action be evaluated and decisions be made in the best overall public interest based upon a balanced consideration of the need for safe and efficient transportation; of the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed transportation improvement; and of national, State, and local environmental protection goals.</P>
            <P>(d) Public involvement and a systematic interdisciplinary approach be essential parts of the development process for proposed actions.</P>
            <P>(e) Measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts be incorporated into the action. Measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts are eligible for Federal funding when the Administration determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) The impacts for which the mitigation is proposed actually result from the Administration action; and</P>
            <P>(2) The proposed mitigation represents a reasonable public expenditure after considering the impacts of the action and the benefits of the proposed mitigation measures. In making this determination, the Administration will consider, among other factors, the extent to which the proposed measures would assist in complying with a Federal statute, executive order, or Administration regulation or policy.</P>
            <P>(f) Costs incurred by the applicant for the preparation of environmental documents requested by the Administration be eligible for Federal assistance.</P>

            <P>(g) No person, because of handicap, age, race, color, sex, or national origin, be excluded from participating in, or denied benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any Administration <PRTPAGE P="522"/>program or procedural activity required by or developed pursuant to this part.</P>

              <E T="03">Applicant.</E> Any Federal, State, local, or federally recognized Indian Tribal governmental unit that requests funding approval or other action by the Administration and that the Administration works with to conduct environmental studies and prepare environmental review documents. When another Federal agency, or the Administration itself, is implementing the action, then the lead agencies (as defined in this section) may assume the responsibilities of the applicant in this part. If there is no applicant, then the Federal lead agency will assume the responsibilities of the applicant in this part.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Environmental studies.</E> The investigations of potential environmental impacts to determine the environmental process to be followed and to assist in the preparation of the environmental document.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Lead agencies.</E> The Administration and any other agency designated to serve as a joint lead agency with the Administration under 23 U.S.C. 139(c)(3) or under the CEQ regulations.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Participating agency.</E> A Federal, State, local, or federally recognized Indian Tribal governmental unit that may have an interest in the proposed project and has accepted an invitation to be a participating agency or, in the case of a Federal agency, has not declined the invitation in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(d)(3).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Programmatic approaches.</E> An approach that reduces the need for project-by-project reviews, eliminates repetitive discussion of the same issue, or focuses on the actual issues ripe for analyses at each level of review, consistent with NEPA and other applicable law.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Project sponsor.</E> The Federal, State, local, or federally recognized Indian Tribal governmental unit, or other entity, including any private or public-private entity that seeks Federal funding or an Administration action for a project. Where it is not the applicant, the project sponsor may conduct some of the activities on the applicant's behalf.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 4(f).</E> Refers to 49 U.S.C. 303 and 23 U.S.C. 138 (as implemented by 23 CFR part 774).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability and responsibilities.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a)(1) The provisions of this part and the CEQ regulations apply to actions where the Administration exercises sufficient control to condition the permit, project, or other approvals. Steps taken by the applicant that do not require Federal approvals, such as preparation of a regional transportation plan, are not subject to this part.<PRTPAGE P="523"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) This part does not apply to or alter approvals by the Administration made prior to November 28, 2018.</P>
            <P>(3) For FHWA and FTA, environmental documents accepted or prepared after November 28, 2018 must be developed in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(4) FRA will apply this part to actions initiated after November 28, 2018.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The project sponsor, in cooperation with the Administration, is responsible for implementing those mitigation measures stated as commitments in the environmental documents prepared pursuant to this part unless the Administration approves of their deletion or modification in writing. The FHWA will ensure that this is accomplished as a part of its stewardship and oversight responsibilities. The FRA and FTA will ensure implementation of committed mitigation measures through incorporation by reference in the grant agreement, followed by reviews of designs and construction inspections.</P>
            <P>(2) When entering into Federal-aid project agreements pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 106, FHWA must ensure that the State highway agency constructs the project in accordance with and incorporates all committed environmental impact mitigation measures listed in approved environmental review documents.</P>
            <P>(c) The following roles and responsibilities apply during the environmental review process:</P>
            <P>(1) The lead agencies are responsible for managing the environmental review process and the preparation of the appropriate environmental review documents.</P>
            <P>(2) Any State or local governmental entity applicant that is or is expected to be a direct recipient of funds under title 23, U.S. Code or chapter 53 of title 49, U.S. Code for the action, or is or is expected to be a direct recipient of financial assistance for which FRA is responsible (e.g., Subtitle V of Title 49, U.S. Code) must serve as a joint lead agency with the Administration in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139, and may prepare environmental review documents if the Administration furnishes guidance and independently evaluates the documents.</P>
            <P>(3) The Administration may invite other Federal, State, local, or federally recognized Indian Tribal governmental units to serve as joint lead agencies in accordance with the CEQ regulations. If the applicant is serving as a joint lead agency under 23 U.S.C. 139(c)(3), then the Administration and the applicant will decide jointly which other agencies to invite to serve as joint lead agencies.</P>
            <P>(4) When the applicant seeks an Administration action other than the approval of funds, the Administration will determine the role of the applicant in accordance with the CEQ regulations and 23 U.S.C. 139.</P>
            <P>(5) Regardless of its role under paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section, a public agency that has statewide jurisdiction (for example, a State highway agency or a State department of transportation) or a local unit of government acting through a statewide agency, that meets the requirements of section 102(2)(D) of NEPA, may prepare the EIS and other environmental review documents with the Administration furnishing guidance, participating in the preparation, and independently evaluating the document. All FHWA applicants qualify under this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(6) Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the role of a project sponsor that is a private institution or firm is limited to providing technical studies and commenting on environmental review documents.</P>
            <P>(7) A participating agency must provide input during the times specified in the coordination plan under 23 U.S.C. 139(g) and within the agency's special expertise or jurisdiction. Participating agencies provide comments and concurrence on the schedule within the coordination plan.</P>

            <P>(d) When entering into Federal-aid project agreements pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 106, the State highway agency must ensure that the project is constructed in accordance with and incorporates all committed environmental impact mitigation measures listed in approved environmental review documents unless the State requests and receives written FHWA approval to modify or delete such mitigation features.<PRTPAGE P="524"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) When FRA is the lead Federal agency, the project sponsor is a private entity, and there is no applicant acting as a joint-lead agency, FRA and the project sponsor may agree to use a qualified third-party contractor to prepare an EIS. Under this arrangement, a project sponsor retains a contractor to assist FRA in conducting the environmental review. FRA selects, oversees, and directs the preparation of the EIS and retains ultimate control over the contractor's work. To enter into a third-party contract, FRA, the project sponsor, and the contractor will enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that outlines at a minimum the conditions and procedures to be followed in carrying out the MOU and the responsibilities of the parties to the MOU. FRA may require use of a third-party contractor for preparation of an EA at its discretion.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 771.111</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Early coordination, public involvement, and project development.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) Early coordination with appropriate agencies and the public aids in determining the type of environmental review documents an action requires, the scope of the document, the level of analysis, and related environmental requirements. These activities contribute to reducing or eliminating delay, duplicative processes, and conflict, including by incorporating planning outcomes that have been reviewed by agencies and Indian Tribal partners in project development.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) The information and results produced by or in support of the transportation planning process may be incorporated into environmental review documents in accordance with 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508, 23 CFR part 450, 23 CFR part 450 Appendix A, or 23 U.S.C. 139(f), 168, or 169, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(ii) The planning process described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section may include mitigation actions consistent with a programmatic mitigation plan developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 169 or from a programmatic mitigation plan developed outside of that framework.</P>
            <P>(3) Applicants intending to apply for funds or request Administration action should notify the Administration at the time that a project concept is identified. When requested, the Administration will advise the applicant, insofar as possible, of the probable class of action (see § 771.115) and related environmental laws and requirements and of the need for specific studies and findings that would normally be developed during the environmental review process. A lead agency, in consultation with participating agencies, must develop an environmental checklist, as appropriate, to assist in resource and agency identification.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The Administration will identify the probable class of action as soon as sufficient information is available to identify the probable impacts of the action.</P>
            <P>(2) For projects to be evaluated with an EIS, the Administration must respond in writing to a project sponsor's formal project notification within 45 days of receipt.</P>
            <P>(c) When the FHWA, FRA, or FTA are jointly involved in the development of an action, or when the FHWA, FRA, or FTA act as a joint lead agency with another Federal agency, a mutually acceptable process will be established on a case-by-case basis. A project sponsor may request the Secretary to designate the lead Federal agency when project elements fall within the expertise of multiple U.S. DOT agencies.</P>
            <P>(d) During early coordination, the lead agencies may invite other agencies that may have an interest in the action to participate. The lead agencies must, however, invite such agencies if the action is subject to the project development procedures in 23 U.S.C. 139 within 45 days from publication of the notice of intent.<SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> Any such agencies with special expertise concerning the action may also be invited to become cooperating agencies. Any such agencies with jurisdiction by law concerning the action must be invited to become cooperating agencies.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>2</SU> The Administration has guidance on 23 U.S.C. 139 available at <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov</E> or in hard copy upon request.</P>
            </FTNT>

            <P>(e) Other States and Federal land management entities that may be significantly affected by the action or by any of the alternatives must be notified early and their views solicited by <PRTPAGE P="525"/>the applicant in cooperation with the Administration. The Administration will provide direction to the applicant on how to approach any significant unresolved issues as early as possible during the environmental review process.</P>
            <P>(f) Any action evaluated under NEPA as a categorical exclusion (CE), environmental assessment (EA), or environmental impact statement (EIS) must:</P>
            <P>(1) Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address environmental matters on a broad scope;</P>

            <P>(2) Have independent utility or independent significance, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> be usable and be a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation improvements in the area are made; and</P>
            <P>(3) Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably foreseeable transportation improvements.</P>
            <P>(g) For major transportation actions, the tiering of EISs as discussed in the CEQ regulation (40 CFR 1502.20) may be appropriate. The first tier EIS would focus on broad issues such as general location, mode choice, and areawide air quality and land use implications of the major alternatives. The second tier would address site-specific details on project impacts, costs, and mitigation measures.</P>
            <P>(h) For the Federal-aid highway program:</P>
            <P>(1) Each State must have procedures approved by the FHWA to carry out a public involvement/public hearing program pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 128 and 139 and CEQ regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) State public involvement/public hearing procedures must provide for:</P>
            <P>(i) Coordination of public involvement activities and public hearings with the entire NEPA process;</P>
            <P>(ii) Early and continuing opportunities during project development for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic, and environmental impacts, as well as impacts associated with relocation of individuals, groups, or institutions;</P>
            <P>(iii) One or more public hearings or the opportunity for hearing(s) to be held by the State highway agency at a convenient time and place for any Federal-aid project that requires significant amounts of right-of-way, substantially changes the layout or functions of connecting roadways or of the facility being improved, has a substantial adverse impact on abutting property, otherwise has a significant social, economic, environmental or other effect, or for which the FHWA determines that a public hearing is in the public interest;</P>
            <P>(iv) Reasonable notice to the public of either a public hearing or the opportunity for a public hearing. Such notice will indicate the availability of explanatory information. The notice must also provide information required to comply with public involvement requirements of other laws, executive orders, and regulations;</P>
            <P>(v) Explanation at the public hearing of the following information, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(A) The project's purpose, need, and consistency with the goals and objectives of any local urban planning,</P>
            <P>(B) The project's alternatives and major design features,</P>
            <P>(C) The social, economic, environmental, and other impacts of the project,</P>
            <P>(D) The relocation assistance program and the right-of-way acquisition process, and</P>
            <P>(E) The State highway agency's procedures for receiving both oral and written statements from the public;</P>
            <P>(vi) Submission to the FHWA of a transcript of each public hearing and a certification that a required hearing or hearing opportunity was offered. The transcript will be accompanied by copies of all written statements from the public, both submitted at the public hearing or during an announced period after the public hearing;</P>
            <P>(vii) An opportunity for public involvement in defining the purpose and need and the range of alternatives, for any action subject to the project development procedures in 23 U.S.C. 139; and</P>

            <P>(viii) Public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment on a Section 4(f) <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact finding, in accordance with 23 CFR 774.5(b)(2)(i).</P>
            <P>(i) Applicants for FRA programs or the FTA capital assistance program:</P>

            <P>(1) Achieve public participation on proposed actions through activities that engage the public, including public hearings, town meetings, and <PRTPAGE P="526"/>charrettes, and seek input from the public through scoping for the environmental review process. Project milestones may be announced to the public using electronic or paper media (e.g., newsletters, note cards, or emails) pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.6. For actions requiring EISs, an early opportunity for public involvement in defining the purpose and need for the action and the range of alternatives must be provided, and a public hearing will be held during the circulation period of the draft EIS.</P>
            <P>(2) May participate in early scoping as long as enough project information is known so the public and other agencies can participate effectively. Early scoping constitutes initiation of NEPA scoping while local planning efforts to aid in establishing the purpose and need and in evaluating alternatives and impacts are underway. Notice of early scoping must be made to the public and other agencies. If early scoping is the start of the NEPA process, the early scoping notice must include language to that effect. After development of the proposed action at the conclusion of early scoping, FRA or FTA will publish the notice of intent if it is determined at that time that the proposed action requires an EIS. The notice of intent will establish a 30-day period for comments on the purpose and need, alternatives, and the scope of the NEPA analysis.</P>
            <P>(3) Are encouraged to post and distribute materials related to the environmental review process, including, environmental documents (e.g., EAs and EISs), environmental studies (e.g., technical reports), public meeting announcements, and meeting minutes, through publicly-accessible electronic means, including project websites. Applicants should keep these materials available to the public electronically until the project is constructed and open for operations.</P>
            <P>(4) Should post all findings of no significant impact (FONSIs), combined final environmental impact statements (final EISs)/records of decision (RODs), and RODs on a project website until the project is constructed and open for operation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Classes of actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>There are three classes of actions that prescribe the level of documentation required in the NEPA process. A programmatic approach may be used for any class of action.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">EIS (Class I).</E> Actions that significantly affect the environment require an EIS (40 CFR 1508.27). The following are examples of actions that normally require an EIS:</P>
            <P>(1) A new controlled access freeway.</P>
            <P>(2) A highway project of four or more lanes on a new location.</P>
            <P>(3) Construction or extension of a fixed transit facility (e.g., rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, bus rapid transit) that will not be located primarily within an existing transportation right-of-way.</P>
            <P>(4) New construction or extension of a separate roadway for buses or high occupancy vehicles not located within an existing transportation right-of-way.</P>
            <P>(5) New construction or extension of a separate roadway for buses not located primarily within an existing transportation right-of-way.</P>
            <P>(6) New construction of major railroad lines or facilities (e.g., terminal passenger stations, freight transfer yards, or railroad equipment maintenance facilities) that will not be located within an existing transportation right-of-way.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">CE (Class II).</E> Actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant environmental effect are excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or EIS. A specific list of CEs normally not requiring NEPA documentation is set forth in § 771.117(c) for FHWA actions or pursuant to § 771.118(c) for FTA actions. When appropriately documented, additional projects may also qualify as CEs pursuant to § 771.117(d) for FHWA actions or pursuant to § 771.118(d) for FTA actions. FRA's CEs are listed in § 771.116.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">EA (Class III).</E> Actions for which the Administration has not clearly established the significance of the environmental impact. All actions that are not EISs or CEs are EAs. All actions in this class require the preparation of an EA to determine the appropriate environmental document required.</P>

            <P>(11) Construction of rail storage and maintenance facilities in areas used predominantly for industrial or transportation purposes where such construction is not inconsistent with existing zoning, and where there is no significant noise impact on the surrounding community.</P>
            <P>(12) Acquisition of land for hardship or protective purposes. Hardship and protective buying will be permitted only for a particular parcel or a limited number of parcels. These types of land acquisition qualify for a CE only where the acquisition will not limit the evaluation of alternatives, including shifts in alignment for planned construction projects, which may be required in the NEPA process. No project development on such land may proceed until the NEPA process has been completed.</P>

            <P>(i) Hardship acquisition is early acquisition of property by the applicant at the property owner's request to alleviate particular hardship to the owner, in contrast to others, because of an inability to sell his property. This is justified when the property owner can document on the basis of health, safety or financial reasons that remaining in the property poses an undue hardship compared to others.<PRTPAGE P="533"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Protective acquisition is done to prevent imminent development of a parcel that may be needed for a proposed transportation corridor or site. Documentation must clearly demonstrate that development of the land would preclude future transportation use and that such development is imminent. Advance acquisition is not permitted for the sole purpose of reducing the cost of property for a proposed project.</P>

            <P>(f) Where a pattern emerges of granting CE status for a particular type of action, the FHWA will initiate rulemaking proposing to add this type of action to the list of categorical exclusions in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(g) FHWA may enter into programmatic agreements with a State to allow a State DOT to make a NEPA CE certification or determination and approval on FHWA's behalf, for CEs specifically listed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and that meet the criteria for a CE under 40 CFR 1508.4, and are identified in the programmatic agreement. Such agreements must be subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) The agreement must set forth the State DOT's responsibilities for making CE determinations, documenting the determinations, and achieving acceptable quality control and quality assurance;</P>
            <P>(2) The agreement may not have a term of more than five years, but may be renewed;</P>
            <P>(3) The agreement must provide for FHWA's monitoring of the State DOT's compliance with the terms of the agreement and for the State DOT's execution of any needed corrective action. FHWA must take into account the State DOT's performance when considering renewal of the programmatic CE agreement; and</P>
            <P>(4) The agreement must include stipulations for amendment, termination, and public availability of the agreement once it has been executed.</P>
            <P>(h) Any action qualifying as a CE under § 771.116 or § 771.118 may be approved by FHWA when the applicable requirements of those sections have been met. FHWA may consult with FRA or FTA to ensure the CE is applicable to the proposed action.</P>

            <P>(a)(1) The applicant must prepare an EA in consultation with the Administration for each action that is not a CE and does not clearly require the preparation of an EIS, or where the Administration concludes an EA would assist in determining the need for an EIS.</P>

            <P>(2) When FTA or the applicant, as joint lead agency, select a contractor to prepare the EA, then the contractor <PRTPAGE P="537"/>must execute an FTA conflict of interest disclosure statement. The statement must be maintained in the FTA Regional Office and with the applicant. The contractor's scope of work for the preparation of the EA should not be finalized until the early coordination activities or scoping process found in paragraph (b) of this section is completed (including FTA approval, in consultation with the applicant, of the scope of the EA content).</P>
            <P>(3) When FRA or the applicant, as joint lead agency, select a contractor to prepare the EA, then the contractor must execute an FRA conflict of interest disclosure statement. In the absence of an applicant, FRA may require private project sponsors to provide a third-party contractor to prepare the EA as described in 771.109(e).</P>
            <P>(b) For actions that require an EA, the applicant, in consultation with the Administration, must, at the earliest appropriate time, begin consultation with interested agencies and others to advise them of the scope of the project and to achieve the following objectives: Determine which aspects of the proposed action have potential for social, economic, or environmental impact; identify alternatives and measures that might mitigate adverse environmental impacts; and identify other environmental review and consultation requirements that should be performed concurrently with the EA. The applicant must accomplish this through early coordination activities or through a scoping process. The applicant must summarize the public involvement process and include the results of agency coordination in the EA.</P>
            <P>(c) The Administration must approve the EA before it is made available to the public as an Administration document.</P>
            <P>(d) The applicant does not need to circulate the EA for comment, but the document must be made available for public inspection at the applicant's office and at the appropriate Administration field offices or, for FRA at Headquarters, for 30 days and in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. The applicant must send the notice of availability of the EA, which briefly describes the action and its impacts, to the affected units of Federal, Tribal, State and local government. The applicant must also send notice to the State intergovernmental review contacts established under Executive Order 12372. To minimize hardcopy requests and printing costs, the Administration encourages the use of project websites or other publicly accessible electronic means to make the EA available.</P>
            <P>(e) When a public hearing is held as part of the environmental review process for an action, the EA must be available at the public hearing and for a minimum of 15 days in advance of the public hearing. The applicant must publish a notice of the public hearing in local newspapers that announces the availability of the EA and where it may be obtained or reviewed. Any comments must be submitted in writing to the applicant or the Administration during the 30-day availability period of the EA unless the Administration determines, for good cause, that a different period is warranted. Public hearing requirements are as described in § 771.111.</P>
            <P>(f) When a public hearing is not held, the applicant must place a notice in a newspaper(s) similar to a public hearing notice and at a similar stage of development of the action, advising the public of the availability of the EA and where information concerning the action may be obtained. The notice must invite comments from all interested parties. Any comments must be submitted in writing to the applicant or the Administration during the 30-day availability period of the EA unless the Administration determines, for good cause, that a different period is warranted.</P>
            <P>(g) If no significant impacts are identified, the applicant must furnish the Administration a copy of the revised EA, as appropriate; the public hearing transcript, where applicable; copies of any comments received and responses thereto; and recommend a FONSI. The EA should also document compliance, to the extent possible, with all applicable environmental laws and executive orders, or provide reasonable assurance that their requirements can be met.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Draft environmental impact statements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A draft EIS must be prepared when the Administration determines that the action is likely to cause significant impacts on the environment. When the applicant, after consultation with any project sponsor that is not the applicant, has notified the Administration in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(e), and the decision has been made by the Administration to prepare an EIS, the Administration will issue a notice of intent (40 CFR 1508.22) for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Applicants are encouraged to announce the intent to prepare an EIS by appropriate means at the State or local level.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) After publication of the notice of intent, the lead agencies, in cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency), will begin a scoping process that may take into account any planning work already accomplished, in accordance with 23 CFR 450.212, 450.318, 23 CFR part 450 Appendix A, or any applicable provisions of the CEQ regulations at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508. The scoping process will be used to identify the purpose and need, the range of alternatives and impacts, and the significant issues to be addressed in the EIS and to achieve the other objectives of 40 CFR 1501.7. Scoping is normally achieved through public and agency involvement procedures required by § 771.111. If a scoping meeting is to be held, it should be announced in the Administration's notice of intent and by appropriate means at the State or local level.</P>
            <P>(2) The lead agencies must establish a coordination plan, including a schedule, within 90 days of notice of intent publication.</P>

            <P>(c) The draft EIS must be prepared by the lead agencies, in cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency). The draft EIS must evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the action and <PRTPAGE P="539"/>document the reasons why other alternatives, which may have been considered, were eliminated from detailed study. The range of alternatives considered for further study must be used for all Federal environmental reviews and permit processes, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law, unless the lead and participating agencies agree to modify the alternatives in order to address significant new information and circumstances or to fulfill NEPA responsibilities in a timely manner, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(f)(4)(B). The draft EIS must also summarize the studies, reviews, consultations, and coordination required by environmental laws or executive orders to the extent appropriate at this stage in the environmental process.</P>
            <P>(d) Any of the lead agencies may select a consultant to assist in the preparation of an EIS in accordance with applicable contracting procedures and with 40 CFR 1506.5(c). When FTA or the applicant, as joint lead agency, select a contractor to prepare the EIS, then the contractor must execute an FTA conflict of interest disclosure statement. The statement must be maintained in the FTA Regional Office and with the applicant. The contractor's scope of work for the preparation of the EIS will not be finalized until the early coordination activities or scoping process found in paragraph (b) of this section is completed (including FTA approval, in consultation with the applicant, of the scope of the EIS content). When FRA or the applicant, as joint lead agency, select a contractor to prepare the EIS, then the contractor must execute an FRA conflict of interest disclosure statement.</P>
            <P>(e) The draft EIS should identify the preferred alternative to the extent practicable. If the draft EIS does not identify the preferred alternative, the Administration should provide agencies and the public with an opportunity after issuance of the draft EIS to review the impacts of the preferred alternative.</P>
            <P>(f) At the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative (or portion thereof) for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives in order to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or compliance with other legal requirements, including permitting. The development of such higher level of detail must not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative that is being considered in the environmental review process.<SU>3</SU>

            <P>(g) The Administration, when satisfied that the draft EIS complies with NEPA requirements, will approve the draft EIS for circulation by signing and dating the cover sheet. The cover sheet should include a notice that after circulation of the draft EIS and consideration of the comments received, the Administration will issue a combined final EIS/ROD document unless statutory criteria or practicability considerations preclude issuance of the combined document.</P>
            <P>(h) A lead, joint lead, or a cooperating agency must be responsible for publication and distribution of the EIS. Normally, copies will be furnished free of charge. However, with Administration concurrence, the party requesting the draft EIS may be charged a fee that is not more than the actual cost of reproducing the copy or may be directed to the nearest location where the statement may be reviewed. To minimize hardcopy requests and printing costs, the Administration encourages the use of project websites or other publicly accessible electronic means to make the draft EIS available.</P>

The draft EIS must be made available to the public and transmitted to agencies for comment no later than the time the document is filed with the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.9. The draft EIS must be transmitted to:</P>

            <P>(1) Public officials, interest groups, and members of the public known to have an interest in the proposed action or the draft EIS;<PRTPAGE P="540"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Cooperating and participating agencies. The draft EIS must also be transmitted directly to appropriate State and local agencies, and to the State intergovernmental review contacts established under Executive Order 12372; and</P>
            <P>(3) States and Federal land management entities that may be significantly affected by the proposed action or any of the alternatives. These transmittals must be accompanied by a request that such State or entity advise the Administration in writing of any disagreement with the evaluation of impacts in the statement. The Administration will furnish the comments received to the applicant along with a written assessment of any disagreements for incorporation into the final EIS.</P>
            <P>(j) When a public hearing on the draft EIS is held (if required by § 771.111), the draft EIS must be available at the public hearing and for a minimum of 15 days in advance of the public hearing. The availability of the draft EIS must be mentioned, and public comments requested, in any public hearing notice and at any public hearing presentation.

            <SUBJECT>Final environmental impact statement/record of decision document.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) After circulation of a draft EIS and consideration of comments received, the lead agencies, in cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency), must combine the final EIS and ROD, to the maximum extent practicable, unless:</P>
            <P>(i) The final EIS makes substantial changes to the proposed action that are relevant to environmental or safety concerns; or</P>
            <P>(ii) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns that bear on the proposed action or the impacts of the proposed action.</P>
            <P>(2) When the combined final EIS/ROD is a single document, it must include the content of a final EIS presented in § 771.125 and present the basis for the decision as specified in 40 CFR 1505.2, summarize any mitigation measures that will be incorporated in the project, and document any required Section 4(f) approval in accordance with part 774 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) If the comments on the draft EIS are minor and confined to factual corrections or explanations that do not warrant additional agency response, an errata sheet may be attached to the draft statement pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 139(n)(1) and 40 CFR 1503.4(c), which together must then become the combined final EIS/ROD.</P>
            <P>(4) A combined final EIS/ROD will be reviewed for legal sufficiency prior to issuance by the Administration.</P>
            <P>(5) The Administration must indicate approval of the combined final EIS/ROD by signing the document. The provision on Administration's Headquarters prior concurrence in § 771.125(c) applies to the combined final EIS/ROD.</P>
            <P>(b) The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> public availability notice published by EPA (40 CFR 1506.10) will not establish a waiting period or a period of time for the return of comments on a combined final EIS/ROD. When filed with EPA, the combined final EIS/ROD must be available at the applicant's offices and at appropriate Administration offices. A copy should also be made available at institutions such as local government offices, libraries, and schools, as appropriate. To minimize hardcopy requests and printing costs, the Administration encourages the use of project websites or other publicly accessible electronic means to make the combined final EIS/ROD available.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Final environmental impact statements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) After circulation of a draft EIS and consideration of comments received, a final EIS must be prepared by the lead agencies, in cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency). The final EIS must identify the preferred alternative and evaluate all reasonable alternatives considered. It must also discuss substantive comments received on the draft EIS and responses thereto, summarize public involvement, and describe the mitigation measures that are to be incorporated into the proposed action. Mitigation measures presented as commitments in the final EIS will be incorporated into the project as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of § 771.109. The final EIS should also document compliance, to the extent possible, with all applicable environmental laws and executive orders, or provide reasonable assurance that their requirements can be met.</P>
            <P>(2) Every reasonable effort must be made to resolve interagency disagreements on actions before processing the final EIS. If significant issues remain unresolved, the final EIS must identify those issues and the consultations and other efforts made to resolve them.</P>
            <P>(b) The final EIS will be reviewed for legal sufficiency prior to Administration approval.</P>
            <P>(c) The Administration will indicate approval of the EIS for an action by signing and dating the cover page. Final EISs prepared for actions in the following categories will be submitted to the Administration's Headquarters for prior concurrence:</P>
            <P>(1) Any action for which the Administration determines that the final EIS should be reviewed at the Headquarters office. This would typically occur when the Headquarters office determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) Additional coordination with other Federal, State or local governmental agencies is needed;</P>
            <P>(ii) The social, economic, or environmental impacts of the action may need to be more fully explored;</P>
            <P>(iii) The impacts of the proposed action are unusually great; (iv) major issues remain unresolved; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The action involves national policy issues.</P>
            <P>(2) Any action to which a Federal, State or local government agency has indicated opposition on environmental grounds (which has not been resolved to the written satisfaction of the objecting agency).</P>
            <P>(d) Approval of the final EIS is not an Administration action as defined in § 771.107 and does not commit the Administration to approve any future request for financial assistance to fund the preferred alternative.</P>
            <P>(e) The initial publication of the final EIS must be in sufficient quantity to meet the request for copies that can be reasonably expected from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Normally, copies will be furnished free of charge. However, with Administration concurrence, the party requesting the final EIS may be charged a fee that is not more than the actual cost of reproducing the copy or may be directed to the nearest location where the statement may be reviewed.</P>
            <P>(f) The final EIS must be transmitted to any persons, organizations, or agencies that made substantive comments on the draft EIS or requested a copy, no later than the time the document is filed with EPA. In the case of lengthy documents, the agency may provide alternative circulation processes in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.19. The applicant must also publish a notice of availability in local newspapers and make the final EIS available through the mechanism established pursuant to DOT Order 4600.13, which implements Executive Order 12372. When filed with EPA, the final EIS must be available for public review at the applicant's offices and at appropriate Administration offices. A copy should also be made available for public review at institutions such as local government offices, libraries, and schools, as appropriate. To minimize hardcopy requests and printing costs, the Administration encourages the use of project websites or other publicly accessible electronic means to make the final EIS available.</P>
            <P>(g) The final EIS may take the form of an errata sheet pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 139(n)(1) and 40 CFR 1503.4(c).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Record of decision.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) When the final EIS is not combined with the ROD, the Administration will complete and sign a ROD no sooner than 30 days after publication of the final EIS notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or 90 days after publication of a notice for the draft EIS, whichever is later. The ROD will present the basis for the decision as specified in 40 CFR 1505.2, summarize any mitigation measures that will be incorporated in the project, and document any required Section 4(f) approval in accordance with part 774 of this chapter. To minimize hardcopy requests and printing costs, the Administration encourages the use of project websites or other publicly accessible electronic means to make the ROD available.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Administration subsequently wishes to approve an alternative that was not identified as the preferred alternative but was fully evaluated in the draft EIS, combined FEIS/ROD, or final EIS, or proposes to make substantial changes to the mitigation measures or findings discussed in the ROD, a revised or amended ROD must be subject to review by those Administration offices that reviewed the final EIS under § 771.124(a) or § 771.125(c). To the extent practicable, the approved revised or amended ROD must be provided to all persons, organizations, and agencies that received a copy of the final EIS.</P>

            <P>The Administration must determine, prior to granting any new approval related to an action or amending any previously approved aspect of an action, including mitigation commitments, whether an approved environmental document remains valid as described in this section.</P>
            <P>(a) The applicant must prepare a written evaluation of the draft EIS, in cooperation with the Administration, if an acceptable final EIS is not submitted to the Administration within three years from the date of the draft EIS circulation. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether or not a supplement to the draft EIS or a new draft EIS is needed.</P>
            <P>(b) The applicant must prepare a written evaluation of the final EIS before the Administration may grant further approvals if major steps to advance the action (e.g., authority to undertake final design, authority to acquire a significant portion of the right-of-way, or approval of the plans, specifications and estimates) have not occurred within three years after the approval of the final EIS, final EIS supplement, or the last major Administration approval or grant.</P>
            <P>(c) After the Administration issues a combined final EIS/ROD, ROD, FONSI, or CE designation, the applicant must consult with the Administration prior to requesting any major approvals or grants to establish whether or not the approved environmental document or CE designation remains valid for the requested Administration action. These consultations will be documented when determined necessary by the Administration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Supplemental environmental impact statements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A draft EIS, final EIS, or supplemental EIS may be supplemented at any time. An EIS must be supplemented whenever the Administration determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) Changes to the proposed action would result in significant environmental impacts that were not evaluated in the EIS; or</P>
            <P>(2) New information or circumstances relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts would result in significant environmental impacts not evaluated in the EIS.</P>
            <P>(b) However, a supplemental EIS will not be necessary where:</P>
            <P>(1) The changes to the proposed action, new information, or new circumstances result in a lessening of adverse environmental impacts evaluated in the EIS without causing other environmental impacts that are significant and were not evaluated in the EIS; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Administration decides to approve an alternative fully evaluated in an approved final EIS but not identified as the preferred alternative. In such a case, a revised ROD must be prepared and circulated in accordance with § 771.127(b).</P>

            <P>(c) Where the Administration is uncertain of the significance of the new <PRTPAGE P="543"/>impacts, the applicant will develop appropriate environmental studies or, if the Administration deems appropriate, an EA to assess the impacts of the changes, new information, or new circumstances. If, based upon the studies, the Administration determines that a supplemental EIS is not necessary, the Administration must so indicate in the project file.</P>

            <P>(d) A supplement is to be developed using the same process and format (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> draft EIS, final EIS, and ROD) as an original EIS, except that scoping is not required.</P>
            <P>(e) In some cases, an EA or supplemental EIS may be required to address issues of limited scope, such as the extent of proposed mitigation or the evaluation of location or design variations for a limited portion of the overall project. Where this is the case, the preparation of a supplemental document must not necessarily:</P>
            <P>(1) Prevent the granting of new approvals;</P>
            <P>(2) Require the withdrawal of previous approvals; or</P>
            <P>(3) Require the suspension of project activities, for any activity not directly affected by the supplement. If the changes in question are of such magnitude to require a reassessment of the entire action, or more than a limited portion of the overall action, the Administration must suspend any activities that would have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives, until the supplemental document is completed.</P>

            <P>(a) The combined final EIS/ROD, final EIS or FONSI should document compliance with requirements of all applicable environmental laws, executive orders, and other related requirements. If full compliance is not possible by the time the combined final EIS/ROD, final EIS or FONSI is prepared, the combined final EIS/ROD, final EIS or FONSI should reflect consultation with the appropriate agencies and provide reasonable assurance that the requirements will be met. Approval of the environmental document constitutes adoption of any Administration findings and determinations that are contained therein. The FHWA's approval of an environmental document constitutes its finding of compliance with the report requirements of 23 U.S.C. 128.</P>

            <P>(1) At a minimum, the highway agency shall consider noise abatement in the form of a noise barrier.</P>
            <P>(2) If a highway agency chooses to use absorptive treatments as a functional enhancement, the highway agency shall adopt a standard practice for using absorptive treatment that is consistent and uniformly applied statewide.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Examination and evaluation of feasible and reasonable noise abatement measures for reducing the traffic noise impacts.</E> Each highway agency, with FHWA approval, shall develop feasibility and reasonableness factors.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Feasibility</E>: (i) Achievement of at least a 5 dB(A) highway traffic noise reduction at impacted receptors. The highway agency shall define, and receive FHWA approval for, the number of receptors that must achieve this reduction for the noise abatement measure to be acoustically feasible and explain the basis for this determination; and</P>

            <P>(ii) Determination that it is possible to design and construct the noise abatement measure. Factors to consider are safety, barrier height, topography, drainage, utilities, and maintenance of the abatement measure, maintenance access to adjacent properties, and access to adjacent properties (<E T="03">i.e.</E> arterial widening projects).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasonableness</E>:—(i) <E T="03">Consideration of the viewpoints of the property owners and residents of the benefited receptors.</E> The highway agency shall solicit the viewpoints of all of the benefited receptors and obtain enough responses to document a decision on either desiring or not desiring the noise abatement measure. The highway agency shall define, and receive FHWA approval for, the number of receptors that are needed to constitute a decision and explain the basis for this determination.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cost effectiveness of the highway traffic noise abatement measures.</E> Each highway agency shall determine, and receive FHWA approval for, the allowable cost of abatement by determining a baseline cost reasonableness value. This determination may include the actual construction cost of noise abatement, cost per square foot of abatement, the maximum square footage of abatement/benefited receptor and either the cost/benefited receptor or cost/benefited receptor/dB(A) reduction. The highway agency shall re-analyze the allowable cost for abatement on a regular interval, not to exceed 5 years. A highway agency has the option of justifying, for FHWA approval, different cost allowances for a particular geographic area(s) within the State, however, the highway agancy must use the same cost reasonableness/construction cost ratio statewide.<PRTPAGE P="549"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Noise reduction design goals for highway traffic noise abatement measures.</E> When noise abatement measure(s) are being considered, a highway agency shall achieve a noise reduction design goal. The highway agency shall define, and receive FHWA approval for, the design goal of at least 7 dB(A) but not more than 10 dB(A), and shall define the number of benefited receptors that must achieve this design goal and explain the basis for this determination.</P>
            <P>(iv) The reasonableness factors listed in § 772.13(d)(5)(i), (ii) and (iii), must collectively be achieved in order for a noise abatement measure to be deemed reasonable. Failure to achieve § 772.13(d)(5)(i), (ii) or (iii), will result in the noise abatement measure being deemed not reasonable.</P>
            <P>(v) In addition to the required reasonableness factors listed in § 772.13(d)(5)(i), (ii), and (iii), a highway agency has the option to also include the following reasonableness factors: Date of development, length of time receivers have been exposed to highway traffic noise impacts, exposure to higher absolute highway traffic noise levels, changes between existing and future build conditions, percentage of mixed zoning development, and use of noise compatible planning concepts by the local government. No single optional reasonableness factor can be used to determine reasonableness.</P>
            <P>(e) Assessment of Benefited Receptors. Each highway agency shall define the threshold for the noise reduction which determines a benefited receptor as at or above the 5 dB(A), but not to exceed the highway agency's reasonableness design goal.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Abatement measure reporting</E>: Each highway agency shall maintain an inventory of all constructed noise abatement measures. The inventory shall include the following parameters: type of abatement; cost (overall cost, unit cost per/sq. ft.); average height; length; area; location (State, county, city, route); year of construction; average insertion loss/noise reduction as reported by the model in the noise analysis; NAC category(s) protected; material(s) used (precast concrete, berm, block, cast in place concrete, brick, metal, wood, fiberglass, combination, plastic (transparent, opaque, other); features (absorptive, reflective, surface texture); foundation (ground mounted, on structure); project type (Type I, Type II, and optional project types such as State funded, county funded, tollway/turnpike funded, other, unknown). The FHWA will collect this information, in accordance with OMB's Information Collection requirements.</P>
            <P>(g) Before adoption of a CE, FONSI, or ROD, the highway agency shall identify:</P>
            <P>(1) Noise abatement measures which are feasible and reasonable, and which are likely to be incorporated in the project; and</P>
            <P>(2) Noise impacts for which no noise abatement measures are feasible and reasonable.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Documentation of highway traffic noise abatement</E>: The environmental document shall identify locations where noise impacts are predicted to occur, where noise abatement is feasible and reasonable, and locations with impacts that have no feasible or reasonable noise abatement alternative. For environmental clearance, this analysis shall be completed to the extent that design information on the alterative(s) under study in the environmental document is available at the time the environmental clearance document is completed. A statement of likelihood shall be included in the environmental document since feasibility and reasonableness determinations may change due to changes in project design after approval of the environmental document. The statement of likelihood shall include the preliminary location and physical description of noise abatement measures determined feasible and reasonable in the preliminary analysis. The statement of likelihood shall also indicate that final recommendations on the construction of an abatement measure(s) is determined during the completion of the project's final design and the public involvement processes.</P>

            <P>(h) The FHWA will not approve project plans and specifications unless feasible and reasonable noise abatement measures are incorporated into the plans and specifications to reduce the noise impact on existing activities, developed lands, or undeveloped lands for which development is permitted.<PRTPAGE P="550"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) For design-build projects, the preliminary technical noise study shall document all considered and proposed noise abatement measures for inclusion in the NEPA document. Final design of design-build noise abatement measures shall be based on the preliminary noise abatement design developed in the technical noise analysis. Noise abatement measures shall be considered, developed, and constructed in accordance with this standard and in conformance with the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.5(c) and 23 CFR 636.109.</P>
            <P>(j) Third party funding is not allowed on a Federal or Federal-aid Type I or Type II project if the noise abatement measure would require the additional funding from the third party to be considered feasible and/or reasonable. Third party funding is acceptable on a Federal or Federal-aid highway Type I or Type II project to make functional enhancements, such as absorptive treatment and access doors or aesthetic enhancements, to a noise abatement measure already determined feasible and reasonable.</P>
            <P>(k) On a Type I or Type II projects, a highway agency has the option to cost average noise abatement among benefited receptors within common noise environments if no single common noise environment exceeds two times the highway agency's cost reasonableness criteria and collectively all common noise environments being averaged do not exceed the highway agency's cost reasonableness criteria.</P>

            <P>(i) A summary of State procedures currently in place to guide the development of documents, analyses, and consultations required to fulfill the environmental review responsibilities requested. For States that have comparable State environmental review procedures, the discussion should describe the differences, if any, between the State environmental review process and the Federal environmental review process, focusing on any standard <PRTPAGE P="555"/>that is mandated by State law, regulation, executive order, or policy that is not applicable to the Federal environmental review. The State must submit a copy of the procedures with the application unless these are available electronically. The State may submit the procedures electronically, either through email or by providing a hyperlink;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any changes that the State has made or will make in the management of its environmental program to provide the additional staff and training necessary for quality control and assurance, appropriate levels of analysis, adequate expertise in areas where the State is requesting responsibilities, and expertise in management of the NEPA process and reviews under other Federal environmental laws;</P>
            <P>(iii) A discussion of how the State will conduct legal reviews for the environmental documents it produces, including legal sufficiency reviews where required by law, policy, or guidance;</P>
            <P>(iv) A discussion of how the State will identify and address those projects that without assignment would have required FHWA Headquarters' prior concurrence of the final environmental impact statement under 23 CFR 771.125(c); and</P>
            <P>(v) A discussion of otherwise permissible project delivery methods the State intends to pursue, and the process it will use to decide whether pursuing those project delivery methods and being responsible for the environmental review meet the objectivity and integrity requirements of NEPA.</P>
            <P>(4) A verification of the personnel necessary to carry out the authority that the State may assume under the Program. The verification must contain the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of the staff positions, including management, that will be dedicated to fulfilling the additional functions needed to perform the assigned responsibilities;</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of any changes to the State's organizational structure that would be necessary to provide for efficient administration of the responsibilities assumed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A discussion of personnel needs that may be met by the State's use of outside consultants, including legal counsel provided by the State Attorney General or private counsel;</P>
            <P>(5) A summary of the anticipated financial resources available to meet the activities and staffing needs identified in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, and a commitment to make adequate financial resources available to meet these needs;</P>
            <P>(6) Certification and explanation by the State's Attorney General, or other State official legally empowered by State law to issue legal opinions that bind the State, that the State has legal authority to assume the responsibilities of the Secretary for the Federal environmental laws and projects requested, and that the State consents to exclusive Federal court jurisdiction with respect to the responsibilities the State is requesting to assume. Such consent must be broad enough to include future changes in relevant Federal policies and procedures or allow for its amendment to include such future changes;</P>
            <P>(7) Certification by the State's Attorney General, or other State official legally empowered by State law to issue legal opinions that bind the State, that the State has laws that are comparable to FOIA, including laws that allow for any decision regarding the public availability of a document under those laws to be reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction;</P>
            <P>(8) Evidence that the required notice and solicitation of public comment by the State relating to participation in the Program has taken place and copies of the State's responses to the comments;</P>
            <P>(9) A point of contact for questions regarding the application and a point of contact regarding the implementation of the Program (if different); and</P>
            <P>(10) The State Governor's (or in the case of District of Columbia, the Mayor's) signature approving the application. For the Secretary's responsibilities with respect to highway projects, the top ranking transportation official in the State who is charged with responsibility for highway construction may sign the application instead of the Governor.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Public transportation project responsibilities.</E> An eligible State may <PRTPAGE P="556"/>submit an application to FTA to participate in the Program for one or more public transportation projects or classes of public transportation projects. The application must provide the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section, but with respect to FTA's program and the public transportation project(s) at issue. In addition, the application must include:</P>
            <P>(1) Evidence that FHWA has assigned to the State, or the State has requested assignment of the responsibilities of, FHWA with respect to one or more highway projects within the State under NEPA; and</P>
            <P>(2) Evidence that any potential recipients of assistance under chapter 53 of title 49 U.S.C. for any public transportation project or classes of public transportation projects in the State being sought for Program assignment have received written notice of the application with adequate time to provide comments on the application.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Railroad project responsibilities.</E> An eligible State may submit an application to FRA to participate in the Program for one or more railroad projects or classes of railroad projects. The application must provide the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section, but with respect to the railroad project(s) at issue. In addition, the application must include evidence that FHWA has assigned to the State, or the State has requested assignment of, the responsibilities of FHWA with respect to one or more highway projects within the State under NEPA.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Multimodal project responsibilities.</E> The Operating Administration(s) will presume that the responsibilities sought by the State include the Secretary's environmental review responsibilities for multimodal projects' elements that would otherwise fall under the Operating Administration's authority. These responsibilities include establishing appropriate relationships with the other Operating Administration(s) involved in the multimodal project, including cooperating agency, participating agency, and lead or co-lead agency relationships under NEPA. The State must affirmatively reject multimodal environmental review responsibilities in its application if it intends to have the responsibilities remain with the Operating Administration when a multimodal project is involved. In addition, States may:</P>
            <P>(1) Request the Secretary's environmental review responsibilities with respect to the highway, railroad, and/or public transportation elements of one or more particular multimodal projects by submitting an application with the information required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section, but with respect to the multimodal project(s) at issue. The application must either request highway responsibilities for the multimodal project or include evidence that FHWA has assigned to the State, or the State has requested assignment of, the responsibilities of FHWA with respect to one or more highway projects within the State under NEPA; and</P>
            <P>(2) Request, at the same time the State applies for assignment of one of the Operating Administration's environmental review responsibilities, the general multimodal environmental review responsibilities of the other Operating Administration(s).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Electronic submissions.</E> Applications may be submitted electronically to the appropriate Operating Administration.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Joint application.</E> A State may submit joint applications for multiple Operating Administrations' responsibilities. A joint application should avoid redundancies and duplication of information to the maximum extent practicable. In its application, the State must distinguish the projects or classes of projects it seeks to assume by transportation mode. A joint application must provide all of the information required by each Operating Administration for which a State is seeking assignment. A State must submit joint applications to FHWA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Requests for additional information.</E> The appropriate Operating Administration(s) may request that the State provide additional information to address any deficiencies in the application or clarifications that may be needed prior to determining that the application is complete.</P>

Materials made available for this public review must include the State's application, a draft of the MOU, and a list of responsibilities sought by the State that the Operating Administration(s) proposes to retain. The notification may be a joint notification if two or more Operating Administrations are involved in the assignment for a project or a class of projects.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Operating Administration(s) approves the application of a State, then the Operating Administration(s) will invite the State to execute the MOU.</P>
            <P>(c) The Administrator for the appropriate Operating Administration will be responsible for approving the application and executing the MOU on behalf of the Operating Administration.</P>
            <P>(d) The State's participation in the Program is effective upon full execution of the MOU. The Operating Administration's responsibilities under NEPA and any other environmental laws may not be assigned to or assumed by the State prior to execution of the MOU with the exception of renewal situations under § 773.115(g) of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) The MOU must have a term of not more than 5 years that may be renewed pursuant to § 773.115 of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) The State must publish the MOU and approved application on its Web site and other relevant State Web sites and make it reasonably available to the public for inspection and copying.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application amendments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) After a State submits its application to the appropriate Operating Administration(s), but prior to the execution of the MOU(s), the State may amend its application at any time to request the addition or withdrawal of projects, classes of projects, or environmental review responsibilities consistent with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to submitting any such amendment, the State must coordinate with the appropriate Operating Administration(s) to determine if the amendment represents a substantial change in the application to such an extent that additional notice and opportunity for public comment is needed. The Operating Administration is responsible for making the final decision on whether notice and public comment is needed and whether to provide one opportunity (pursuant to § 773.107(b)) or two opportunities (pursuant to § 773.107(b) and § 773.111(a)) for public comment. The Operating Administration will make this determination based on the magnitude of the changes.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Operating Administration determines that notice and solicitation of public comment is needed pursuant to § 773.107(b), the State must include copies of all comments received, responses to substantive comments, and note the changes, if any, that were made in response to the comments.</P>
            <P>(b) After the execution of the MOU(s) or renewal MOU(s), a State may amend its application to the appropriate Operating Administration(s) to request additional projects, classes of projects, or more environmental review responsibilities consistent with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to requesting any such amendment, the State must coordinate with the appropriate Operating Administration(s) to determine if the amendment represents a substantial change in the application information to the extent that additional notice and opportunity for public comment is needed. The Operating Administration is responsible for making the final decision on whether notice and public comment are needed and whether to provide one opportunity (pursuant to § 773.107(b) or § 773.111(a)) or two opportunities (pursuant to § 773.107(b) and § 773.111(a)) for public comment. The Operating Administration will make this determination based on the magnitude of the changes.</P>

            <P>(2) If the Operating Administration determines that notice and solicitation of public comment is required pursuant to § 773.107(b), the State must include copies of all comments received, responses to substantive comments, and note the changes, if any, that were made in response to the comments.<PRTPAGE P="558"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The Operating Administration is responsible for making the final decision on whether to accept the amendment and whether an amendment to the MOU is required. Amendments do not change the expiration date of the initial or renewal MOU.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Renewals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A State that intends to renew its participation in the Program must notify the appropriate Operating Administration(s) at least 12 months before the expiration of the MOU.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to requesting renewal, the State must coordinate with the appropriate Operating Administration(s) to determine if significant changes have occurred or new assignment responsibilities are being sought that would warrant statewide notice and opportunity for public comment prior to the State's submission of the renewal package. The Operating Administration is responsible for making the final decision on whether the State should engage in statewide notification prior to its submittal. The Operating Administration will make this determination based on the magnitude of the change(s) in the information and/or circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) The renewal package must:</P>
            <P>(1) Describe changes to the information submitted in the initial Program application;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide up-to-date certifications required in § 773.109(a)(6) and (7) of this part for the applicable Operating Administration(s), if up-to-date certifications are needed or if the necessary State laws have termination dates that would occur before the end of a renewal period;</P>
            <P>(3) Provide evidence of the statewide public notification, if one was required under paragraph (b) of this section, and include copies of all comments received, responses to substantive comments, and note the changes, if any, that were made to the renewal package in response to the comments; and</P>
            <P>(4) Include the State Governor's (or in the case of District of Columbia, the Mayor's) signature approving the renewal package. For the Secretary's responsibilities with respect to highway projects, the top ranking transportation official in the State who is charged with responsibility for highway construction may sign the renewal package instead of the Governor.</P>
            <P>(d) A State must submit a renewal package no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the MOU.</P>
            <P>(e) The Operating Administration(s) may request that the State provide additional information to address any deficiencies in the renewal application or to provide clarifications.</P>
            <P>(f) The Operating Administration(s) must provide <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notification and solicit public comment on the renewal request and must consider comments received before approving the State's renewal application. Materials made available for this public review will include the State's original application, the renewal package, a draft of the renewal MOU, a list of responsibilities sought by the State that the Operating Administration proposes to retain, and auditing and monitoring reports developed as part of the Program. The notification may be a joint notification if two or more Operating Administrations are involved in the assignment for a project or a class of projects.</P>
            <P>(g) In determining whether to approve the State's renewal request, the Operating Administration will take into account the renewal package, comments received if an opportunity for public comments was provided in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the auditing and monitoring reports, and the State's overall performance in the Program. If the Operating Administration(s) approves the renewal request, then the Operating Administration(s) will invite the State to execute the renewal MOU. The Administrator for the appropriate Operating Administration will be responsible for approving the application and executing the renewal MOU on behalf of the Operating Administration. The renewal MOU must have a term of not more than 5 years, and the State must publish it on the State's DOT Web site and other relevant State Web site(s).</P>

            <P>(h) At the discretion of the Operating Administration, a State may retain temporarily its assigned and assumed responsibilities under a MOU after the <PRTPAGE P="559"/>expiration of the MOU, where the relevant Operating Administration(s) determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) The State made a timely submission of a complete renewal application in accordance with the provisions of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) The Operating Administration(s) determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to achieve a timely execution of the renewal; and</P>
            <P>(3) The Operating Administration(s) determines that it is in the best interest of the public to grant the continuance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Termination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Termination by the Operating Administration.</E> An Operating Administration(s) that approved the State's participation in the Program may terminate the State's participation if the Operating Administration(s) determines that the State is not adequately carrying out the responsibilities assigned to the State. Examples of situations where such a finding may be made include: persistent neglect of, or noncompliance with, any Federal laws, regulations, and policies; failure to address deficiencies identified during the audit or monitoring process; failure to secure or maintain adequate personnel and/or financial resources to carry out the responsibilities assumed; intentional noncompliance with the terms of the MOU(s); and persistent failure to adequately consult, coordinate, and/or take into account the concerns of other Operating Administrations, when applicable, and appropriate Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies with oversight, consulting, or coordination responsibilities under Federal environmental laws and regulations.</P>
            <P>(1) The Operating Administration(s) may rely on the auditing and monitoring reports as sources for a finding that the State is not adequately carrying out its responsibilities. The Operating Administration(s) may also rely on information on noncompliance obtained outside the auditing and monitoring process.</P>
            <P>(2) The Operating Administration(s) may not terminate a State's participation without providing the State with notification of the noncompliance issue that could give rise to the termination, and without affording the State an opportunity to take corrective action to address the noncompliance issue. The Operating Administration(s) must provide the State a period of no less than thirty (30) days to take the corrective actions. The Operating Administration(s) is responsible for making the final decision on whether the corrective action is satisfactory.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination by the State.</E> The State may terminate its participation at any time by notifying the Secretary no later than 90 days prior to the proposed termination date. The notice must include a draft transition plan detailing how the State will transfer the projects and responsibilities to the appropriate Operating Administration(s). Termination will not take effect until the State and the Operating Administration(s) agree, and the Operating Administration(s) approve a final transition plan. Transition plans must include:</P>
            <P>(1) A list of projects and their status in the environmental review process that the State will return to the Operating Administration(s);</P>
            <P>(2) A process for transferring files on pending projects;</P>
            <P>(3) A process for notifying the public that the State will terminate its participation in the Program and a projected date upon which this termination will take effect;</P>
            <P>(4) Points of contacts for pending projects; and</P>
            <P>(5) Any other information required by the Operating Administration(s) to ensure the smooth transition of environmental review responsibilities and prevent disruption in the environmental reviews of projects to the maximum extent possible.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination by mutual agreement.</E> The State and the Operating Administration(s) may agree to terminate assignment on a specific date before the expiration of the MOU. Termination will not take effect until the State and the Operating Administration(s) agree, and the Operating Administration(s) approve a final transition plan. Transition plans must include the information outlined in paragraphs (b)(1)-(5) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="560"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of termination of highway responsibilities.</E> Termination of the assignment of the Secretary's environmental review responsibilities with respect to highway projects will result in the termination of assignment of environmental responsibilities for railroad, public transportation, and multimodal projects.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to implement 23 U.S.C. 138 and 49 U.S.C. 303, which were originally enacted as Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 and are still commonly referred to as “Section 4(f).”</P>

            <SUBJECT>Section 4(f) approvals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Administration may not approve the use, as defined in § 774.17, of Section 4(f) property unless a determination is made under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(a) The Administration determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) There is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative, as defined in § 774.17, to the use of land from the property; and</P>
            <P>(2) The action includes all possible planning, as defined in § 774.17, to minimize harm to the property resulting from such use; or</P>

            <P>(b) The Administration determines that the use of the property, including any measure(s) to minimize harm (such as any avoidance, minimization, mitigation, or enhancement measures) committed to by the applicant, will have a <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact, as defined in § 774.17, on the property.</P>
            <P>(c) If the analysis in paragraph (a)(1) of this section concludes that there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative, then the Administration may approve, from among the remaining alternatives that use Section 4(f) property, only the alternative that:</P>
            <P>(1) Causes the least overall harm in light of the statute's preservation purpose. The least overall harm is determined by balancing the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The ability to mitigate adverse impacts to each Section 4(f) property (including any measures that result in benefits to the property);</P>
            <P>(ii) The relative severity of the remaining harm, after mitigation, to the protected activities, attributes, or features that qualify each Section 4(f) property for protection;</P>
            <P>(iii) The relative significance of each Section 4(f) property;</P>
            <P>(iv) The views of the official(s) with jurisdiction over each Section 4(f) property;</P>
            <P>(v) The degree to which each alternative meets the purpose and need for the project;</P>
            <P>(vi) After reasonable mitigation, the magnitude of any adverse impacts to resources not protected by Section 4(f); and</P>
            <P>(vii) Substantial differences in costs among the alternatives.</P>
            <P>(2) The alternative selected must include all possible planning, as defined in § 774.17, to minimize harm to Section 4(f) property.</P>
            <P>(d) Programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations are a time-saving procedural alternative to preparing individual Section 4(f) evaluations under paragraph (a) of this section for certain minor uses of Section 4(f) property. Programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations are developed by the Administration based on experience with a specific set of conditions that includes project type, degree of use and impact, and evaluation of avoidance alternatives. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> An approved programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation may be relied upon to cover a particular project only if the specific conditions in the programmatic evaluation are met</P>

            <P>(1) The determination whether a programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation applies to the use of a specific Section 4(f) property shall be documented as specified in the applicable programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation.</P>

            <P>(2) The Administration may develop additional programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations. Proposed new or revised programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations <PRTPAGE P="562"/>will be coordinated with the Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Housing and Urban Development, and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for comment prior to being finalized. New or revised programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations shall be reviewed for legal sufficiency and approved by the Headquarters Office of the Administration.</P>
            <P>(e) The coordination requirements in § 774.5 must be completed before the Administration may make Section 4(f) approvals under this section. Requirements for the documentation and timing of Section 4(f) approvals are located in §§ 774.7 and 774.9, respectively.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Coordination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Prior to making Section 4(f) approvals under § 774.3(a), the Section 4(f) evaluation shall be provided for coordination and comment to the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource and to the Department of the Interior, and as appropriate to the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Administration shall provide a minimum of 45 days for receipt of comments. If comments are not received within 15 days after the comment deadline, the Administration may assume a lack of objection and proceed with the action.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to making <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact determinations under § 774.3(b), the following coordination shall be undertaken:</P>
            <P>(1) For historic properties:</P>
            <P>(i) The consulting parties identified in accordance with 36 CFR part 800 must be consulted; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The Administration must receive written concurrence from the pertinent State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO), and from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) if participating in the consultation process, in a finding of “no adverse effect” or “no historic properties affected” in accordance with 36 CFR part 800. The Administration shall inform these officials of its intent to make a <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact determination based on their concurrence in the finding of “no adverse effect” or “no historic properties affected.”</P>
            <P>(iii) Public notice and comment, beyond that required by 36 CFR part 800, is not required.</P>
            <P>(2) For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges:</P>
            <P>(i) Public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment concerning the effects on the protected activities, features, or attributes of the property must be provided. This requirement can be satisfied in conjunction with other public involvement procedures, such as a comment period provided on a NEPA document.</P>

            <P>(ii) The Administration shall inform the official(s) with jurisdiction of its intent to make a <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact finding. Following an opportunity for public review and comment as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource must concur in writing that the project will not adversely affect the activities, features, or attributes that make the property eligible for Section 4(f) protection. This concurrence may be combined with other comments on the project provided by the official(s).</P>
            <P>(c) The application of a programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation to the use of a specific Section 4(f) property under § 774.3(d)(1) shall be coordinated as specified in the applicable programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation.</P>
            <P>(d) When Federal encumbrances on Section 4(f) property are identified, coordination with the appropriate Federal agency is required to ascertain the agency's position on the proposed impact, as well as to determine if any other Federal requirements may apply to converting the Section 4(f) land to a different function. Any such requirements must be satisfied, independent of the Section 4(f) approval.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Documentation.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A Section 4(f) evaluation prepared under § 774.3(a) shall include sufficient supporting documentation to demonstrate why there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative and shall summarize the results of all possible planning to minimize harm to the Section 4(f) property.<PRTPAGE P="563"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) A <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact determination under § 774.3(b) shall include sufficient supporting documentation to demonstrate that the impacts, after avoidance, minimization, mitigation, or enhancement measures are taken into account, are <E T="03">de minimis</E> as defined in § 774.17; and that the coordination required in § 774.5(b) has been completed.</P>
            <P>(c) If there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative the Administration may approve only the alternative that causes the least overall harm in accordance with § 774.3(c). This analysis must be documented in the Section 4(f) evaluation.</P>
            <P>(d) The Administration shall review all Section 4(f) approvals under §§ 774.3(a) and 774.3(c) for legal sufficiency.</P>
            <P>(e) A Section 4(f) approval may involve different levels of detail where the Section 4(f) involvement is addressed in a tiered EIS under § 771.111(g) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(1) When the first-tier, broad-scale EIS is prepared, the detailed information necessary to complete the Section 4(f) approval may not be available at that stage in the development of the action. In such cases, the documentation should address the potential impacts that a proposed action will have on Section 4(f) property and whether those impacts could have a bearing on the decision to be made. A preliminary Section 4(f) approval may be made at this time as to whether the impacts resulting from the use of a Section 4(f) property are <E T="03">de minimis</E> or whether there are feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives. This preliminary approval shall include all possible planning to minimize harm to the extent that the level of detail available at the first-tier EIS stage allows. It is recognized that such planning at this stage may be limited to ensuring that opportunities to minimize harm at subsequent stages in the development process have not been precluded by decisions made at the first-tier stage. This preliminary Section 4(f) approval is then incorporated into the first-tier EIS.</P>

            <P>(2) The Section 4(f) approval will be finalized in the second-tier study. If no new Section 4(f) use, other than a <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact, is identified in the second-tier study and if all possible planning to minimize harm has occurred, then the second-tier Section 4(f) approval may finalize the preliminary approval by reference to the first-tier documentation. Re-evaluation of the preliminary Section 4(f) approval is only needed to the extent that new or more detailed information available at the second-tier stage raises new Section 4(f) concerns not already considered.</P>
            <P>(3) The final Section 4(f) approval may be made in the second-tier CE, EA, final EIS, ROD or FONSI.</P>
            <P>(f) In accordance with §§ 771.105(a) and 771.133 of this chapter, the documentation supporting a Section 4(f) approval should be included in the EIS, EA, or for a project classified as a CE, in a separate document. If the Section 4(f) documentation cannot be included in the NEPA document, then it shall be presented in a separate document. The Section 4(f) documentation shall be developed by the applicant in cooperation with the Administration.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 774.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The potential use of land from a Section 4(f) property shall be evaluated as early as practicable in the development of the action when alternatives to the proposed action are under study.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for actions processed with EISs the Administration will make the Section 4(f) approval either in the final EIS or in the ROD. Where the Section 4(f) approval is documented in the final EIS, the Administration will summarize the basis for its Section 4(f) approval in the ROD. Actions requiring the use of Section 4(f) property, and proposed to be processed with a FONSI or classified as a CE, shall not proceed until notification by the Administration of Section 4(f) approval.</P>
            <P>(c) After the CE, FONSI, or ROD has been processed, a separate Section 4(f) approval will be required, except as provided in § 774.13, if:</P>
            <P>(1) A proposed modification of the alignment or design would require the use of Section 4(f) property; or</P>

            <P>(2) The Administration determines that Section 4(f) applies to the use of a property; or<PRTPAGE P="564"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) A proposed modification of the alignment, design, or measures to minimize harm (after the original Section 4(f) approval) would result in a substantial increase in the amount of Section 4(f) property used, a substantial increase in the adverse impacts to Section 4(f) property, or a substantial reduction in the measures to minimize harm.</P>
            <P>(d) A separate Section 4(f) approval required under paragraph (c) of this section will not necessarily require the preparation of a new or supplemental NEPA document. If a new or supplemental NEPA document is also required under § 771.130 of this chapter, then it should include the documentation supporting the separate Section 4(f) approval. Where a separate Section 4(f) approval is required, any activity not directly affected by the separate Section 4(f) approval can proceed during the analysis, consistent with § 771.130(f) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(e) Section 4(f) may apply to archeological sites discovered during construction, as set forth in § 774.11(f). In such cases, the Section 4(f) process will be expedited and any required evaluation of feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives will take account of the level of investment already made. The review process, including the consultation with other agencies, will be shortened as appropriate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Administration will determine the applicability of Section 4(f) in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(b) When another Federal agency is the Federal lead agency for the NEPA process, the Administration shall make any required Section 4(f) approvals unless the Federal lead agency is another U.S. DOT agency.</P>
            <P>(c) Consideration under Section 4(f) is not required when the official(s) with jurisdiction over a park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge determine that the property, considered in its entirety, is not significant. In the absence of such a determination, the Section 4(f) property will be presumed to be significant. The Administration will review a determination that a park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge is not significant to assure its reasonableness.</P>
            <P>(d) Where Federal lands or other public land holdings (e.g., State forests) are administered under statutes permitting management for multiple uses, and, in fact, are managed for multiple uses, Section 4(f) applies only to those portions of such lands which function for, or are designated in the plans of the administering agency as being for, significant park, recreation, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge purposes. The determination of which lands so function or are so designated, and the significance of those lands, shall be made by the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource. The Administration will review this determination to assure its reasonableness.</P>
            <P>(e) In determining the applicability of Section 4(f) to historic sites, the Administration, in cooperation with the applicant, will consult with the official(s) with jurisdiction to identify all properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (National Register). The Section 4(f) requirements apply to historic sites on or eligible for the National Register unless the Administration determines that an exception under § 774.13 applies.</P>
            <P>(1) The Section 4(f) requirements apply only to historic sites on or eligible for the National Register unless the Administration determines that the application of Section 4(f) is otherwise appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) The Interstate System is not considered to be a historic site subject to Section 4(f), with the exception of those individual elements of the Interstate System formally identified by FHWA for Section 4(f) protection on the basis of national or exceptional historic significance.</P>
            <P>(f) Section 4(f) applies to all archeological sites on or eligible for inclusion on the National Register, including those discovered during construction, except as set forth in § 774.13(b).</P>

            <P>(g) Section 4(f) applies to those portions of federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers that are otherwise eligible as historic sites, or that are publicly owned and function as, or are designated in a management plan as, a significant park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge. All other <PRTPAGE P="565"/>applicable requirements of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271-1287, must be satisfied, independent of the Section 4(f) approval.</P>
            <P>(h) When a property formally reserved for a future transportation facility temporarily functions for park, recreation, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge purposes in the interim, the interim activity, regardless of duration, will not subject the property to Section 4(f).</P>
            <P>(i) When a property is formally reserved for a future transportation facility before or at the same time a park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge is established, and concurrent or joint planning or development of the transportation facility and the Section 4(f) resource occurs, then any resulting impacts of the transportation facility will not be considered a use as defined in § 774.17.</P>
            <P>(1) Formal reservation of a property for a future transportation use can be demonstrated by a document of public record created prior to or contemporaneously with the establishment of the park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge. Examples of an adequate document to formally reserve a future transportation use include:</P>
            <P>(i) A map of public record that depicts a transportation facility on the property;</P>
            <P>(ii) A land use or zoning plan depicting a transportation facility on the property; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A fully executed real estate instrument that references a future transportation facility on the property.</P>
            <P>(2) Concurrent or joint planning or development can be demonstrated by a document of public record created after, contemporaneously with, or prior to the establishment of the Section 4(f) property. Examples of an adequate document to demonstrate concurrent or joint planning or development include:</P>
            <P>(i) A document of public record that describes or depicts the designation or donation of the property for both the potential transportation facility and the Section 4(f) property; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A map of public record, memorandum, planning document, report, or correspondence that describes or depicts action taken with respect to the property by two or more governmental agencies with jurisdiction for the potential transportation facility and the Section 4(f) property, in consultation with each other.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exceptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Administration has identified various exceptions to the requirement for Section 4(f) approval. These exceptions include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(a) The use of historic transportation facilities in certain circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) Common post-1945 concrete or steel bridges and culverts that are exempt from individual review under 54 U.S.C. 306108.</P>
            <P>(2) Improvement of railroad or rail transit lines that are in use or were historically used for the transportation of goods or passengers, including, but not limited to, maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation, operation, modernization, reconstruction, and replacement of railroad or rail transit line elements, except for:</P>
            <P>(i) Stations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Bridges or tunnels on railroad lines that have been abandoned, or transit lines not in use, over which regular service has never operated, and that have not been railbanked or otherwise reserved for the transportation of goods or passengers; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Historic sites unrelated to the railroad or rail transit lines.</P>
            <P>(3) Maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation, operation, modernization, reconstruction, or replacement of historic transportation facilities, if the Administration concludes, as a result of the consultation under 36 CFR 800.5, that:</P>
            <P>(i) Such work will not adversely affect the historic qualities of the facility that caused it to be on or eligible for the National Register, or this work achieves compliance with Section 106 through a program alternative under 36 CFR 800.14; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource have not objected to the Administration conclusion that the proposed work does not adversely affect the historic qualities of the facility that caused it to be on or eligible for the National Register, or <PRTPAGE P="566"/>the Administration concludes this work achieves compliance with 54 U.S.C. 306108 (Section 106) through a program alternative under 36 CFR 800.14.</P>
            <P>(b) Archeological sites that are on or eligible for the National Register when:</P>
            <P>(1) The Administration concludes that the archeological resource is important chiefly because of what can be learned by data recovery and has minimal value for preservation in place. This exception applies both to situations where data recovery is undertaken and where the Administration decides, with agreement of the official(s) with jurisdiction, not to recover the resource; and</P>
            <P>(2) The official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource have been consulted and have not objected to the Administration finding in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) Designations of park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites that are made, or determinations of significance that are changed, late in the development of a proposed action. With the exception of the treatment of archeological resources in § 774.9(e), the Administration may permit a project to proceed without consideration under Section 4(f) if the property interest in the Section 4(f) land was acquired for transportation purposes prior to the designation or change in the determination of significance and if an adequate effort was made to identify properties protected by Section 4(f) prior to acquisition. However, if it is reasonably foreseeable that a property would qualify as eligible for the National Register prior to the start of construction, then the property should be treated as a historic site for the purposes of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) Temporary occupancies of land that are so minimal as to not constitute a use within the meaning of Section 4(f). The following conditions must be satisfied:</P>
            <P>(1) Duration must be temporary, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, less than the time needed for construction of the project, and there should be no change in ownership of the land;</P>
            <P>(2) Scope of the work must be minor, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, both the nature and the magnitude of the changes to the Section 4(f) property are minimal;</P>
            <P>(3) There are no anticipated permanent adverse physical impacts, nor will there be interference with the protected activities, features, or attributes of the property, on either a temporary or permanent basis;</P>
            <P>(4) The land being used must be fully restored, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the property must be returned to a condition which is at least as good as that which existed prior to the project; and</P>
            <P>(5) There must be documented agreement of the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource regarding the above conditions.</P>
            <P>(e) Projects for the Federal lands transportation facilities described in 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(8).</P>
            <P>(f) Certain trails, paths, bikeways, and sidewalks, in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) Trail-related projects funded under the Recreational Trails Program, 23 U.S.C. 206(h)(2);</P>
            <P>(2) National Historic Trails and the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, designated under the National Trails System Act, 16 U.S.C. 1241-1251, with the exception of those trail segments that are historic sites as defined in § 774.17;</P>
            <P>(3) Trails, paths, bikeways, and sidewalks that occupy a transportation facility right-of-way without limitation to any specific location within that right-of-way, so long as the continuity of the trail, path, bikeway, or sidewalk is maintained; and</P>
            <P>(4) Trails, paths, bikeways, and sidewalks that are part of the local transportation system and which function primarily for transportation.</P>
            <P>(g) Transportation enhancement activities, transportation alternatives projects, and mitigation activities, where:</P>
            <P>(1) The use of the Section 4(f) property is solely for the purpose of preserving or enhancing an activity, feature, or attribute that qualifies the property for Section 4(f) protection; and</P>
            <P>(2) The official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource agrees in writing to paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Constructive use determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A constructive use occurs when the transportation project does not incorporate land from a Section 4(f) property, but the project's proximity impacts are so severe that the protected activities, features, or attributes that qualify the property for protection under Section 4(f) are substantially impaired. Substantial impairment occurs only when the protected activities, features, or attributes of the property are substantially diminished.</P>
            <P>(b) If the project results in a constructive use of a nearby Section 4(f) property, the Administration shall evaluate that use in accordance with § 774.3(a).</P>
            <P>(c) The Administration shall determine when there is a constructive use, but the Administration is not required to document each determination that a project would not result in a constructive use of a nearby Section 4(f) property. However, such documentation may be prepared at the discretion of the Administration.</P>
            <P>(d) When a constructive use determination is made, it will be based upon the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Identification of the current activities, features, or attributes of the property which qualify for protection under Section 4(f) and which may be sensitive to proximity impacts;</P>
            <P>(2) An analysis of the proximity impacts of the proposed project on the Section 4(f) property. If any of the proximity impacts will be mitigated, only the net impact need be considered in this analysis. The analysis should also describe and consider the impacts which could reasonably be expected if the proposed project were not implemented, since such impacts should not be attributed to the proposed project; and</P>
            <P>(3) Consultation, on the foregoing identification and analysis, with the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) property.</P>
            <P>(e) The Administration has reviewed the following situations and determined that a constructive use occurs when:</P>
            <P>(1) The projected noise level increase attributable to the project substantially interferes with the use and enjoyment of a noise-sensitive facility of a property protected by Section 4(f), such as:</P>
            <P>(i) Hearing the performances at an outdoor amphitheater;</P>
            <P>(ii) Sleeping in the sleeping area of a campground;</P>
            <P>(iii) Enjoyment of a historic site where a quiet setting is a generally recognized feature or attribute of the site's significance;</P>
            <P>(iv) Enjoyment of an urban park where serenity and quiet are significant attributes; or</P>
            <P>(v) Viewing wildlife in an area of a wildlife and waterfowl refuge intended for such viewing.</P>
            <P>(2) The proximity of the proposed project substantially impairs esthetic features or attributes of a property protected by Section 4(f), where such features or attributes are considered important contributing elements to the value of the property. Examples of substantial impairment to visual or esthetic qualities would be the location of a proposed transportation facility in such proximity that it obstructs or eliminates the primary views of an architecturally significant historical building, or substantially detracts from the setting of a Section 4(f) property which derives its value in substantial part due to its setting;</P>
            <P>(3) The project results in a restriction of access which substantially diminishes the utility of a significant publicly owned park, recreation area, or a historic site;</P>

            <P>(4) The vibration impact from construction or operation of the project substantially impairs the use of a Section 4(f) property, such as projected vibration levels that are great enough to physically damage a historic building or substantially diminish the utility of the building, unless the damage is repaired and fully restored consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the integrity of the contributing features must be returned to a condition which is substantially similar to that which existed prior to the project; or</P>

            <P>(5) The ecological intrusion of the project substantially diminishes the value of wildlife habitat in a wildlife and waterfowl refuge adjacent to the <PRTPAGE P="568"/>project, substantially interferes with the access to a wildlife and waterfowl refuge when such access is necessary for established wildlife migration or critical life cycle processes, or substantially reduces the wildlife use of a wildlife and waterfowl refuge.</P>
            <P>(f) The Administration has reviewed the following situations and determined that a constructive use does not occur when:</P>
            <P>(1) Compliance with the requirements of 36 CFR 800.5 for proximity impacts of the proposed action, on a site listed on or eligible for the National Register, results in an agreement of “no historic properties affected” or “no adverse effect;”</P>
            <P>(2) For projected noise levels:</P>
            <P>(i) The impact of projected traffic noise levels of the proposed highway project on a noise-sensitive activity do not exceed the FHWA noise abatement criteria as contained in Table 1 in part 772 of this chapter; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The projected operational noise levels of the proposed transit or railroad project do not exceed the noise impact criteria for a Section 4(f) activity in the FTA guidelines for transit noise and vibration impact assessment or the moderate impact criteria in the FRA guidelines for high-speed transportation noise and vibration impact assessment;</P>
            <P>(3) The projected noise levels exceed the relevant threshold in paragraph (f)(2) of this section because of high existing noise, but the increase in the projected noise levels if the proposed project is constructed, when compared with the projected noise levels if the project is not built, is barely perceptible (3 dBA or less);</P>
            <P>(4) There are proximity impacts to a Section 4(f) property, but a governmental agency's right-of-way acquisition or adoption of project location, or the Administration's approval of a final environmental document, established the location for the proposed transportation project before the designation, establishment, or change in the significance of the property. However, if it is reasonably foreseeable that a property would qualify as eligible for the National Register prior to the start of construction, then the property should be treated as a historic site for the purposes of this section; or</P>
            <P>(5) Overall (combined) proximity impacts caused by a proposed project do not substantially impair the activities, features, or attributes that qualify a property for protection under Section 4(f);</P>
            <P>(6) Proximity impacts will be mitigated to a condition equivalent to, or better than, that which would occur if the project were not built, as determined after consultation with the official(s) with jurisdiction;</P>
            <P>(7) Change in accessibility will not substantially diminish the utilization of the Section 4(f) property; or</P>
            <P>(8) Vibration levels from project construction activities are mitigated, through advance planning and monitoring of the activities, to levels that do not cause a substantial impairment of protected activities, features, or attributes of the Section 4(f) property.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The definitions contained in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. In addition, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Administration.</E> The FHWA, FRA, or FTA, whichever is approving the transportation program or project at issue. A reference herein to the Administration means the State when the State is functioning as the FHWA, FRA, or FTA in carrying out responsibilities delegated or assigned to the State in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 325, 326, 327, or other applicable law.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">All possible planning.</E> All possible planning means that all reasonable measures identified in the Section 4(f) evaluation to minimize harm or mitigate for adverse impacts and effects must be included in the project.</P>
            <P>(1) With regard to public parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, the measures may include (but are not limited to): design modifications or design goals; replacement of land or facilities of comparable value and function; or monetary compensation to enhance the remaining property or to mitigate the adverse impacts of the project in other ways.</P>

            <P>(2) With regard to historic sites, the measures normally serve to preserve <PRTPAGE P="569"/>the historic activities, features, or attributes of the site as agreed by the Administration and the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource in accordance with the consultation process under 36 CFR part 800.</P>
            <P>(3) In evaluating the reasonableness of measures to minimize harm under § 774.3(a)(2), the Administration will consider the preservation purpose of the statute and:</P>
            <P>(i) The views of the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) property;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether the cost of the measures is a reasonable public expenditure in light of the adverse impacts of the project on the Section 4(f) property and the benefits of the measure to the property, in accordance with § 771.105(d) of this chapter; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Any impacts or benefits of the measures to communities or environmental resources outside of the Section 4(f) property.</P>

            <P>(4) All possible planning does not require analysis of feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives, since such analysis will have already occurred in the context of searching for feasible and prudent alternatives that avoid Section 4(f) properties altogether under § 774.3(a)(1), or is not necessary in the case of a <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact determination under § 774.3(b).</P>
            <P>(5) A <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact determination under § 774.3(b) subsumes the requirement for all possible planning to minimize harm by reducing the impacts on the Section 4(f) property to a <E T="03">de minimis</E> level.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Applicant.</E> The Federal, State, or local government authority, proposing a transportation project, that the Administration works with to conduct environmental studies and prepare environmental documents. For transportation actions implemented by the Federal government on Federal lands, the Administration or the Federal land management agency may take on the responsibilities of the applicant described herein.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">CE.</E> Refers to a categorical exclusion, which is an action with no individual or cumulative significant environmental effect pursuant to 40 CFR 1508.4 and § 771.116, § 771.117, or § 771.118 of this chapter; unusual circumstances are taken into account in making categorical exclusion determinations.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">De minimis impact.</E> (1) For historic sites, <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact means that the Administration has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR part 800 that no historic property is affected by the project or that the project will have “no adverse effect” on the historic property in question.</P>

            <P>(2) For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, a <E T="03">de minimis</E> impact is one that will not adversely affect the features, attributes, or activities qualifying the property for protection under Section 4(f).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">EA.</E> Refers to an Environmental Assessment, which is a document prepared pursuant to 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 and § 771.119 of this title for a proposed project that is not categorically excluded but for which an EIS is not clearly required.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">EIS.</E> Refers to an Environmental Impact Statement, which is a document prepared pursuant to NEPA, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and §§ 771.123 and 771.125 of this chapter for a proposed project that is likely to cause significant impacts on the environment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Feasible and prudent avoidance alternative.</E> (1) A feasible and prudent avoidance alternative avoids using Section 4(f) property and does not cause other severe problems of a magnitude that substantially outweighs the importance of protecting the Section 4(f) property. In assessing the importance of protecting the Section 4(f) property, it is appropriate to consider the relative value of the resource to the preservation purpose of the statute.</P>
            <P>(2) An alternative is not feasible if it cannot be built as a matter of sound engineering judgment.</P>
            <P>(3) An alternative is not prudent if:</P>
            <P>(i) It compromises the project to a degree that it is unreasonable to proceed with the project in light of its stated purpose and need;</P>
            <P>(ii) It results in unacceptable safety or operational problems;</P>
            <P>(iii) After reasonable mitigation, it still causes:</P>
            <P>(A) Severe social, economic, or environmental impacts;</P>
            <P>(B) Severe disruption to established communities;<PRTPAGE P="570"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) Severe disproportionate impacts to minority or low income populations; or</P>
            <P>(D) Severe impacts to environmental resources protected under other Federal statutes;</P>
            <P>(iv) It results in additional construction, maintenance, or operational costs of an extraordinary magnitude;</P>
            <P>(v) It causes other unique problems or unusual factors; or</P>
            <P>(vi) It involves multiple factors in paragraphs (3)(i) through (3)(v) of this definition, that while individually minor, cumulatively cause unique problems or impacts of extraordinary magnitude.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">FONSI.</E> Refers to a Finding of No Significant Impact prepared pursuant to 40 CFR 1508.13 and § 771.121 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Historic site.</E> For purposes of this part, the term “historic site” includes any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register. The term includes properties of traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that are included in, or are eligible for inclusion in, the National Register.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Official(s) with jurisdiction.</E> (1) In the case of historic properties, the official with jurisdiction is the SHPO for the State wherein the property is located or, if the property is located on tribal land, the THPO. If the property is located on tribal land but the Indian tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO as provided for in the National Historic Preservation Act, then a representative designated by such Indian tribe shall be recognized as an official with jurisdiction in addition to the SHPO. When the ACHP is involved in a consultation concerning a property under Section 106 of the NHPA, the ACHP is also an official with jurisdiction over that resource for purposes of this part. When the Section 4(f) property is a National Historic Landmark, the National Park Service is also an official with jurisdiction over that resource for purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of public parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, the official(s) with jurisdiction are the official(s) of the agency or agencies that own or administer the property in question and who are empowered to represent the agency on matters related to the property.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of portions of Wild and Scenic Rivers to which Section 4(f) applies, the official(s) with jurisdiction are the official(s) of the Federal agency or agencies that own or administer the affected portion of the river corridor in question. For State administered, federally designated rivers (section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1273(a)(ii)), the officials with jurisdiction include both the State agency designated by the respective Governor and the Secretary of the Interior.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Railroad or rail transit line elements.</E> Railroad or rail transit line elements include the elements related to the operation of the railroad or rail transit line, such as the railbed, rails, and track; tunnels; elevated support structures and bridges; substations; signal and communication devices; maintenance facilities; and railway-highway crossings.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">ROD.</E> Refers to a record of decision prepared pursuant to 40 CFR 1505.2 and §§ 771.124 or 771.127 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 4(f) evaluation.</E> Refers to the documentation prepared to support the granting of a Section 4(f) approval under § 774.3(a), unless preceded by the word “programmatic.” A “programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation” is the documentation prepared pursuant to § 774.3(d) that authorizes subsequent project-level Section 4(f) approvals as described therein.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 4(f) Property.</E> Section 4(f) property means publicly owned land of a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance, or land of an historic site of national, State, or local significance.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Station.</E> A station is a platform and the associated building or structure such as a depot, shelter, or canopy used by intercity or commuter rail transportation passengers for the purpose of boarding and alighting a train. A station does not include tracks, railyards, or electrification, communications or signal systems, or equipment. A platform alone is not considered a station.<PRTPAGE P="571"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Use.</E> Except as set forth in §§ 774.11 and 774.13, a “use” of Section 4(f) property occurs:</P>
            <P>(1) When land is permanently incorporated into a transportation facility;</P>
            <P>(2) When there is a temporary occupancy of land that is adverse in terms of the statute's preservation purpose as determined by the criteria in § 774.13(d); or</P>
            <P>(3) When there is a constructive use of a Section 4(f) property as determined by the criteria in § 774.15.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 777.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In addition to those contained in 23 U.S.C. 101(a), the following definitions shall apply as used in this part:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Biogeochemical transformations</E> means those changes in chemical compounds and substances which naturally occur in ecosystems. Examples are the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in nature, in which these elements are incorporated from inorganic substances into organic matter and recycled on a continuing basis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Compensatory mitigation</E> means restoration, enhancement, creation, and under exceptional circumstances, preservation, of wetlands, wetland buffer areas, and other natural habitats, carried out to replace or compensate for the loss of wetlands or natural habitat area or functional capacity resulting from Federal-aid projects funded pursuant to provisions of title 23, U.S. Code. Compensatory mitigation usually occurs in advance of or concurrent with the impacts to be mitigated, but may occur after such impacts in special circumstances.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Mitigation bank</E> means a site where wetlands and/or other aquatic resources or natural habitats are restored, created, enhanced, or in exceptional circumstances, preserved, expressly for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar resources. For purposes of the Clean Water Act, Section 404 (33 U.S.C. 1344), use of a mitigation bank can only be authorized when impacts are unavoidable.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Natural habitat</E> means a complex of natural, primarily native or indigenous vegetation, not currently subject to cultivation or artificial landscaping, a primary purpose of which is to provide habitat for wildlife, either terrestrial or aquatic. For purposes of this part, habitat has the same meaning as natural habitat. This definition excludes rights-of-way that are acquired with Federal transportation funds specifically for highway purposes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Net gain of wetlands</E> means a wetland resource conservation and management principle under which, over the long term, unavoidable losses of wetlands area or functional capacity due to highway projects are offset by gains at a ratio greater than 1:1, through restoration, enhancement, preservation, or creation of wetlands or associated areas critical to the protection or conservation of wetland functions. This definition specifically excludes natural habitat, as defined in this section, other than wetlands.<PRTPAGE P="572"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">On-site, in-kind mitigation</E> means compensatory mitigation which replaces wetlands or natural habitat area or functions lost as a result of a highway project with the same or like wetland or habitat type and functions adjacent or contiguous to the site of the impact.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Practicable</E> means available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics, in light of overall project purposes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Service area of a mitigation bank</E> means that the service area of a wetland or natural habitat mitigation bank shall be consistent with that in the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use and Operation of Mitigation Banks (60 FR 58605, November 28, 1995), <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the designated area (e.g., watershed, county) wherein a bank can be expected to provide appropriate compensation for impacts to wetlands and/or other aquatic or natural habitat resources.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland or habitat enhancement</E> means activities conducted in existing wetlands or other natural habitat to achieve specific management objectives or provide conditions which previously did not exist, and which increase one or more ecosystem functions. Enhancement may involve tradeoffs between the resource structure, function, and values; a positive change in one may result in negative effects to other functions. Examples of activities which may be carried out to enhance wetlands or natural habitats include, but are not limited to, alteration of hydrologic regime, vegetation management, erosion control, fencing, integrated pest management and control, and fertilization.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland or habitat establishment period</E> means a period of time agreed to by the FHWA, State DOT, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as necessary to establish wetland or natural habitat functional capacity in a compensatory mitigation project sufficient to compensate wetlands or habitat losses due to impacts of Federal-aid highway projects. The establishment period may vary depending on the specific wetland or habitat type being developed.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland or habitat functional capacity</E> means the ability of a wetland or natural habitat to perform natural functions, such as provide wildlife habitat, support biodiversity, store surface water, or perform biogeochemical transformations, as determined by scientific functional assessment. Natural functions of wetlands include, but are not limited to, those listed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at 33 CFR 320.4(b)(2)(i) through (viii).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland or habitat preservation</E> means the protection of ecologically important wetlands, other aquatic resources, or other natural habitats in perpetuity through the implementation of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms. Preservation of wetlands for compensatory mitigation purposes may include protection of upland areas adjacent to wetlands as necessary to ensure protection and/or enhancement of the aquatic ecosystem.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland or habitat restoration</E> means the reestablishment of wetlands or natural habitats on a site where they formerly existed or exist in a substantially degraded state.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland or wetlands</E> means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetlands or habitat mitigation credit</E> means a unit of wetlands or habitat mitigation, defined either by area or a measure of functional capacity through application of scientific functional assessment. With respect to mitigation banks, this definition means the same as that in the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks.</P>

The justification for the cost of proposed mitigation measures should be considered in the same context as any other public expenditure; that is, the proposed mitigation represents a reasonable public expenditure when weighed against other social, economic, and environmental values, and the benefit realized is commensurate with the proposed expenditure. Mitigation measures shall give like consideration to traffic needs, safety, durability, and economy of maintenance of the highway.</P>
            <P>(b) It is FHWA policy to permit, consistent with the limits set forth in this part, the expenditure of title 23, U.S. Code, funds for activities required for the planning, design, construction, monitoring, and establishment of wetlands and natural habitat mitigation projects, and acquisition of land or interests therein.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Evaluation of impacts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The reasonableness of the public expenditure and extent of Federal participation with title 23, U.S. Code, funds shall be directly related to:</P>
            <P>(1) The importance of the impacted wetlands and natural habitats;</P>
            <P>(2) The extent of highway impacts on the wetlands and natural habitats, as determined through an appropriate, interdisciplinary, impact assessment; and</P>
            <P>(3) Actions necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act, Section 404, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and other relevant Federal statutes.</P>
            <P>(b) Evaluation of the importance of the impacted wetlands and natural habitats shall consider:</P>
            <P>(1) Wetland and natural habitat functional capacity;</P>
            <P>(2) Relative importance of these functions to the total wetland or natural habitat resource of the area;</P>
            <P>(3) Other factors such as uniqueness, esthetics, or cultural values; and</P>
            <P>(4) Input from the appropriate resource management agencies through interagency coordination.</P>
            <P>(c) A determination of the highway impact should focus on both the short-and long-term affects of the project on wetland or natural habitat functional capacity, consistent with 40 CFR part 1500, 40 CFR 1502.16, 33 CFR 320.4, and the FHWA's environmental compliance regulations, found at 23 CFR part 771.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Mitigation of impacts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Actions eligible for Federal funding. There are a number of actions that can be taken to minimize the impact of highway projects on wetlands or natural habitats. The following actions qualify for Federal-aid highway funding:</P>
            <P>(1) Avoidance and minimization of impacts to wetlands or natural habitats through realignment and special design, construction features, or other measures.</P>
            <P>(2) Compensatory mitigation alternatives, either inside or outside of the right-of-way. This includes, but is not limited to, such measures as on-site mitigation, when that alternative is determined to be the preferred approach by the appropriate regulatory agency; improvement of existing degraded or historic wetlands or natural habitats through restoration or enhancement on or off site; creation of new wetlands; and under exceptional circumstances, preservation of existing wetlands or natural habitats on or off site. Restoration of wetlands is generally preferable to enhancement or creation of new wetlands.</P>
            <P>(3) Improvements to existing wetlands or natural habitats. Such activities may include, but are not limited to, construction or modification of water level control structures or ditches, establishment of natural vegetation, re-contouring of a site, installation or removal of irrigation, drainage, or other water distribution systems, integrated pest management, installation of fencing, monitoring, and other measures to protect, enhance, or restore the wetland or natural habitat character of a site.</P>
            <P>(4) Mitigation banks. In accordance with all applicable Federal law (including regulations), with respect to participation in compensatory mitigation related to a project funded under title 23, U.S. Code, that has an impact on wetlands or natural habitat occurring within the service area of a mitigation bank, preference shall be given, to the maximum extent practicable, to the use of the mitigation bank, if the bank contains sufficient available credits to offset the impact and the bank is approved in accordance with the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks, or other agreement between appropriate agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) Mitigation banking alternatives eligible for participation with Federal-aid funds including such measures as the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Mitigation banks in which mitigation credits are purchased by State DOTs to mitigate impacts to wetlands or natural habitats due to projects funded under title 23, U.S. Code, including privately owned banks or those established with private funds to mitigate wetland or natural habitat losses.</P>
            <P>(2) Single purpose banks established by and for the use of a State DOT with Federal-aid participation; or multipurpose publicly owned banks, established with public, non-title 23 Federal highway funds, in which credits may be purchased by highway agencies using title 23 highway funds on a per-credit basis.</P>
            <P>(c) Contributions to statewide and regional efforts to conserve, restore, enhance and create wetlands or natural habitats. Federal-aid funds may participate in the development of statewide and regional wetlands conservation plans, including any efforts and plans authorized pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-640, 104 Stat. 4604). Contributions to these efforts may occur in advance of project construction only if such efforts are consistent with all applicable requirements of Federal law and regulations and State transportation planning processes.</P>
            <P>(d) Mitigation or restoration of historic impacts to wetlands and natural habitats caused by past highway projects funded pursuant to title 23, U.S. Code, even if there is no current federally funded highway project in the immediate vicinity. These impacts must be related to transportation projects funded under the authority of title 23, U.S. Code.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 777.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Other considerations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The development of measures proposed to mitigate impacts to wetlands or natural habitats shall include consultation with appropriate State and Federal agencies.</P>

            <P>(b) Federal-aid funds shall not participate in the replacement of wetlands <PRTPAGE P="575"/>or natural habitats absent sufficient assurances, such as, but not limited to, deed restrictions, fee ownership, permanent easement, or performance bond, that the area will be maintained as a wetland or natural habitat.</P>
            <P>(c) The acquisition of proprietary interests in replacement wetlands or natural habitats as a mitigation measure may be in fee simple, by easement, or by other appropriate legally recognized instrument, such as a banking instrument legally approved by the appropriate regulatory agency. The acquisition of mitigation credits in wetland or natural habitat mitigation banks shall be accomplished through a legally recognized instrument, such as permanent easement, deed restriction, or legally approved mitigation banking instrument, which provides for the protection and permanent continuation of the wetland or natural habitat nature of the mitigation.</P>
            <P>(d) A State DOT may acquire privately owned lands in cooperation with another public agency or third party. Such an arrangement may accomplish greater benefits than would otherwise be accomplished by the individual agency acting alone.</P>
            <P>(e) A State DOT may transfer the title to, or enter into an agreement with, an appropriate public natural resource management agency to manage lands acquired outside the right-of-way without requiring a credit to Federal funds. Any such transfer of title or agreement shall require the continued use of the lands for the purpose for which they were acquired. In the event the purpose is no longer served, the lands and interests therein shall immediately revert to the State DOT for proper disposition.</P>
            <P>(f) The reasonable costs of acquiring lands or interests therein to provide replacement lands with equivalent wetlands or natural habitat area or functional capacity associated with these areas are eligible for Federal participation.</P>
            <P>(g) The objective in mitigating impacts to wetlands in the Federal-aid highway program is to implement the policy of a net gain of wetlands on a program wide basis.</P>
            <P>(h) Certain activities to ensure the viability of compensatory mitigation wetlands or natural habitats during the period of establishment are eligible for Federal-aid participation. These include, but are not limited to, such activities as repair or adjustment of water control structures, pest control, irrigation, fencing modifications, replacement of plantings, and mitigation site monitoring. The establishment period should be specifically determined by the mitigation agreement among the mitigation planners prior to beginning any compensatory mitigation activities.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirement to use electronic toll collection technology.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any toll agency operating a toll facility pursuant to authority under a 1604 toll program shall use an electronic toll collection system as the method for collecting tolls from vehicle operators for the use of the facility unless the toll agency can demonstrate to the FHWA that some other method is either more economically efficient or will make the facility operate more safely. If a facility is collecting tolls pursuant to section 1604(b) of SAFETEA-LU, the toll agency shall only use electronic toll collection systems. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a toll agency from using cash payment methods, such as toll booths, in areas that are not located in the toll facility's lanes of travel if the location and use of such methods do not create unsafe operating conditions on the toll facility.</P>
            <P>(b) A toll agency using electronic toll collection technology must develop and implement reasonable methods to enable vehicle operators that are not enrolled in a toll collection program that is interoperable with the toll collection system of the relevant toll facility to use the facility.</P>
            <P>(c) A toll agency using electronic toll collection technology must develop, implement, and make publicly available privacy policies to safeguard the disclosure of any data that may be collected through such technology concerning any user of a toll facility operating pursuant to authority under a 1604 toll program, but is not required to submit such policies to FHWA for approval.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 950.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Interoperability requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For any toll facility operating pursuant to authority under a 1604 toll program, the toll agency shall—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify the projected users of the facility;</P>
            <P>(2) Identify the predominant toll collection systems likely utilized by the users of the facility; and</P>
            <P>(3) Identify the noncash electronic technology likely to be in use within the next five years in that area.</P>
            <P>(b) Based on the identification conducted under subsection (a), the toll agency shall receive the FHWA's concurrence that the facility's toll collection system's standards and design meet the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) In requesting the FHWA's concurrence, the toll agency shall demonstrate to the FHWA that the selected toll collection system and technology achieves the highest reasonable degree of interoperability both with technology currently in use at other existing toll facilities and with technology likely to be in use at toll facilities within the next five years in that area. The toll agency shall explain to the FHWA how the toll collection system takes into account both the use of noncash electronic technology currently deployed within an appropriate geographic area of travel (as defined by the toll agency) and the noncash electronic technology likely to be in use within the next five years in that area. FHWA, in determining whether to concur in the toll agency's proposal, will give appropriate weight to current and future interoperability with toll facilities in that area. The facility's toll collection system design shall include the communications requirements between roadside equipment and toll transponders, as well as accounting compatibility requirements in order to ensure that users of the toll facilities are properly identified and tolls are charged to the appropriate account of the user.</P>

            <P>(d) A toll agency that operates any toll facility pursuant to authority under a 1604 toll program must upgrade its toll collection system to meet any <PRTPAGE P="592"/>applicable standards and interoperability tests that have been officially adopted through rulemaking by the FHWA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Federal lands congestion management system (CMS).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of this section, congestion means the level at which transportation system performance is no longer acceptable due to traffic interference. For portions of the NPS transportation system outside the boundaries of TMAs, the NPS shall:</P>

              <P>(1) Develop criteria to determine when a CMS is to be implemented for a specific transportation system; and<PRTPAGE P="598"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Have CMS coverage for all transportation systems serving NPS facilities that meet minimum CMS needs criteria, as appropriate, funded through the FLHP.</P>
              <P>(b) The NPS shall consider the results of the CMS when selecting congestion mitigation strategies that are the most time efficient and cost effective and that add value (protection/rejuvenation of resources, improved visitor experience) to the park and adjacent communities.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the requirements provided in § 970.204, the CMS must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) For those NPS transportation systems that require a CMS, in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration shall be given to strategies that promote alternative transportation systems, reduce private automobile travel, and best integrate private automobile travel with other transportation modes.</P>
              <P>(2) For portions of the NPS transportation system within transportation management areas (TMAs), the NPS transportation planning process shall include a CMS that meets the requirements of this section. By agreement between the TMA and the NPS, the TMA's CMS coverage may include the transportation systems serving NPS facilities, as appropriate. Through this agreement(s), the NPS may meet the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If congestion exists at a NPS facility within the boundaries of a TMA, and the TMA's CMS does not provide coverage of the portions of the NPS transportation facilities experiencing congestion, the NPS shall develop a separate CMS to cover those facilities. Approaches may include the use of alternate mode studies and implementation plans as components of the CMS.</P>
              <P>(4) A CMS will:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify and document measures for congestion (e.g., level of service);</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify the causes of congestion;</P>
              <P>(iii) Include processes for evaluating the cost and effectiveness of alternative strategies;</P>

For those FWS transportation systems that require a CMS, in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration shall be given to strategies that reduce private automobile travel and improve existing transportation system efficiency. Approaches may include the use of alternate mode studies and implementation plans as components of the CMS. The FWS shall consider the results of the CMS when selecting the implementation of strategies that provide the most efficient and effective use of existing and future transportation facilities, and alleviate congestion.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements provided in § 972.204, the CMS must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) For portions of the FWS transportation system within TMAs, the FWS transportation planning process shall include a CMS that meets the requirements of this section. By agreement between the TMA and the FWS, the TMA's CMS coverage may include the transportation facilities serving the Refuge System, as appropriate. Through this agreement(s), the FWS may meet the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If congestion exists at a FWS facility within the boundaries of a TMA, and the TMA's CMS does not provide coverage of the portions of the FWS transportation facilities experiencing congestion, the FWS shall develop a separate CMS to cover those facilities.</P>
              <P>(3) For portions of the FWS transportation system outside the boundaries of TMAs, the FWS shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Develop criteria to determine when a CMS is to be implemented for a specific transportation system; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Have CMS coverage for all transportation facilities serving the Refuge System, as appropriate, funded through the FLHP that meet minimum CMS needs criteria.</P>
              <P>(4) A CMS will:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify and document measures for congestion (e.g., level of service);</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify the causes of congestion;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Management systems requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop, establish and implement nationwide pavement, bridge, and safety management systems for federally and tribally owned IRRs. The BIA may tailor the nationwide management systems to meet the agency's goals, policies, and needs, after considering the input from the tribes, and using professional engineering and planning judgment to determine the required nature and extent of systems coverage consistent with the intent and requirements of this rule.</P>
              <P>(b) The BIA and the FHWA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop an implementation plan for each of the nationwide management systems. These plans will include, but are not limited to, the following: Overall goals and policies concerning the nationwide management systems, each agency's responsibilities for developing and implementing the nationwide management systems, implementation schedule, data sources, including the need to accommodate State and local data, and cost estimate.</P>
              <P>(c) Indian tribes may develop, establish, and implement tribal management systems under a self-determination contract or self-governance annual funding agreement. The tribe may tailor the management systems to meet its goals, policies, and needs, using professional engineering and planning judgment to determine the required nature and extent of systems coverage consistent with the intent and requirements of this rule.</P>
              <P>(d) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop criteria for cases in which tribal management systems are not appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, or the tribes under a self-determination contract or self-governance annual funding agreement, may incorporate data provided by States and local governments into the nationwide or tribal management systems, as appropriate, for State and locally owned IRRs.</P>
              <P>(f) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop and implement procedures for the development, establishment, implementation and operation of nationwide management systems. If a tribe develops tribal management systems, the tribe shall develop and implement procedures for the development, establishment, implementation and operation of tribal management systems. The procedures shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of each management system;</P>
              <P>(2) A process to operate and maintain the management systems and their associated databases;</P>
              <P>(3) A process for data collection, processing, analysis and updating for each management system;</P>
              <P>(4) A process for ensuring the results of the management systems are considered in the development of IRR transportation plans and transportation improvement programs and in making project selection decisions under 23 U.S.C. 204; and</P>
              <P>(5) A process for the analysis and coordination of all management systems outputs to systematically operate, maintain, and upgrade existing transportation assets cost-effectively;</P>
              <P>(g) All management systems shall use databases with a common or coordinated reference system that can be used to geolocate all database information.</P>
              <P>(h) Existing data sources may be used by the BIA and the tribes to the maximum extent possible to meet the management system requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) A nationwide congestion management system is not required. The BIA and the FHWA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop criteria for determining when congestion management systems are required for BIA or tribal transportation facilities providing access to and within the Indian reservations. Either the tribes or the BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop, establish and implement congestion management systems for the transportation facilities that meet the criteria.</P>

              <P>(j) The BIA shall develop an appropriate means to evaluate the effectiveness of the nationwide management systems in enhancing transportation investment decisions and improving the overall efficiency of the affected transportation systems and facilities. <PRTPAGE P="613"/>This evaluation is to be conducted periodically, preferably as part of the BIA planning process to assist the FHWA in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the management systems as a component of the IRR program, and may include consultation with the tribes, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(k) The management systems shall be operated so investment decisions based on management system outputs can be accomplished at the BIA region and tribal level and can be utilized throughout the transportation planning process.</P>

              <P>Beginning with grants authorized in fiscal year 2014, to apply for any highway safety grant under 23 U.S.C. Chapter 4, a State shall submit a Highway Safety Plan meeting the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Each fiscal year, the State's Highway Safety Plan shall consist of the following components:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Highway safety planning process.</E> (1) A brief description of the data sources and processes used by the State to identify its highway safety problems, describe its highway safety performance measures and define its performance targets, develop and select evidence-based countermeasure strategies and projects to address its problems and achieve its performance targets. In describing these data sources and processes, the State shall identify the participants in the processes (e.g., highway safety committees, program stakeholders, community and constituent groups), discuss the strategies for project selection (e.g., constituent outreach, public meetings, solicitation of proposals), and list the information and data sources consulted (e.g., <E T="03">Countermeasures That Work,</E> Sixth Edition, 2011).</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the efforts to coordinate and the outcomes from the coordination of the highway safety plan, data collection, and information systems with the State strategic highway safety plan (as defined in 23 U.S.C. 148(a)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance plan.</E> A performance plan containing the following elements:</P>
              <P>(1) A list of annual quantifiable and measurable highway safety performance targets that is data-driven, consistent with the Uniform Guidelines for Highway Safety Program and based on highway safety problems identified by the State during the planning process conducted under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Performance measures developed by DOT in collaboration with the Governor's Highway Safety Association and others, beginning with the MAP-21 directed “Traffic Safety Performance Measures for States and Federal Agencies” (DOT HS 811 025), which are used as a minimum in developing the performance targets identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Beginning with grants awarded after fiscal year 2014, the performance measures common to the State's HSP and the State highway safety improvement program (fatalities, fatality rate, and serious injuries) shall be defined identically, as coordinated through the State strategic highway safety plan. At least one performance measure and performance target that is data driven shall be provided for each program area that enables the State to track progress, from a specific baseline, toward meeting the target (e.g., a target to “increase seat belt use from X percent in Year 1 to Y percent in Year 2,” using a performance measure of “percent of restrained occupants in front outboard seating positions in passenger motor vehicles”). For each performance measure, the State shall provide:</P>
              <P>(i) Documentation of current safety levels;</P>
              <P>(ii) Quantifiable annual performance targets; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Justification for each performance target that explains why the target is appropriate and data-driven.</P>
              <P>(3) Additional performance measures, not included under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For program areas where performance measures have not been jointly developed, a State shall develop its own performance measures and performance targets that are data-driven (e.g., distracted driving, bicycles). The State shall provide the same information as required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Highway safety strategies and projects.</E> A description of—</P>
              <P>(1) Each countermeasure strategy and project the State plans to implement to reach the performance targets identified in paragraph (b) of this section. At a minimum, the State shall describe one year of Section 402 and 405 countermeasure strategies and projects (which should include countermeasure strategies identified in the State strategic highway safety plan) and shall identify funds from other sources, including Federal, State, local, and private sector funds, that the State plans to use for such projects or use to achieve program area performance targets.</P>

              <P>(2) The State's process for selecting the countermeasure strategies and projects described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to allow the State to meet the highway safety performance targets described in paragraph (b) of this <PRTPAGE P="623"/>section. At a minimum, the State shall provide an assessment of the overall traffic safety impacts of the strategies chosen and proposed or approved projects to be funded.</P>
              <P>(3) The data and data analysis or other documentation supporting the effectiveness of proposed countermeasure strategies described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (e.g., the State may include information on the cost effectiveness of proposed countermeasure strategies, if such information is available).</P>
              <P>(4) The evidence-based traffic safety enforcement program to prevent traffic violations, crashes, and crash fatalities and injuries in areas most at risk for such incidents. At a minimum, the State shall provide for—</P>
              <P>(i) An analysis of crashes, crash fatalities, and injuries in areas of highest risk;</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 1200—Participation by Political Subdivisions</HD>

              <P>(a) Policy. To ensure compliance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 402(b)(1)(C) and 23 <PRTPAGE P="657"/>U.S.C. 402(h)(2), which require that at least 40 percent or 95 percent of all Federal funds apportioned under Section 402 to the State or the Secretary of Interior, respectively, will be expended by political subdivisions of the State, including Indian tribal governments, in carrying out local highway safety programs, the NHTSA Approving Official will determine if the political subdivisions had an active voice in the initiation, development and implementation of the programs for which funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 402 are expended.</P>
              <P>(b) Terms.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Local participation</E> refers to the minimum 40 percent or 95 percent (Indian Nations) that must be expended by or for the benefit of political subdivisions.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Political subdivision</E> includes Indian tribes, for purpose and application to the apportionment to the Secretary of Interior.</P>
              <P>(c) Determining local share.</P>
              <P>(1) In determining whether a State meets the local share requirement in a fiscal year, NHTSA will apply the requirement sequentially to each fiscal year's apportionments, treating all apportionments made from a single fiscal year's authorizations as a single entity for this purpose. Therefore, at least 40 percent of each State's apportionments (or at least 95 percent of the apportionment to the Secretary of Interior) from each year's authorizations must be used in the highway safety programs of its political subdivisions prior to the period when funds would normally lapse. The local participation requirement is applicable to the State's total federally funded safety program irrespective of Standard designation or Agency responsibility.</P>
              <P>(2) When Federal funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 402 are expended by a political subdivision, such expenditures are clearly part of the local share. Local highway safety-project-related expenditures and associated indirect costs, which are reimbursable to the grantee local governments, are classifiable as local share. Illustrations of such expenditures are the costs incurred by a local government in planning and administration of highway safety project-related activities, such as occupant protection, traffic records system improvements, emergency medical services, pedestrian and bicycle safety activities, police traffic services, alcohol and other drug countermeasures, motorcycle safety, and speed control.</P>
              <P>(3) When Federal funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 402 are expended by a State agency for the benefit of a political subdivision, such funds may be considered as part of the local share, provided that the political subdivision has had an active voice in the initiation, development, and implementation of the programs for which such funds are expended. A State may not arbitrarily ascribe State agency expenditures as “benefitting local government.” Where political subdivisions have had an active voice in the initiation, development, and implementation of a particular program or activity, and a political subdivision which has not had such active voice agrees in advance of implementation to accept the benefits of the program, the Federal share of the cost of such benefits may be credited toward meeting the local participation requirement. Where no political subdivisions have had an active voice in the initiation, development, and implementation of a particular program, but a political subdivision requests the benefits of the program as part of the local government's highway safety program, the Federal share of the cost of such benefits may be credited toward meeting the local participation requirement. Evidence of consent and acceptance of the work, goods or services on behalf of the local government must be established and maintained on file by the State until all funds authorized for a specific year are expended and audits completed.</P>
              <P>(4) State agency expenditures which are generally not classified as local are within such areas as vehicle inspection, vehicle registration and driver licensing. However, where these areas provide funding for services such as driver improvement tasks administered by traffic courts, or where they furnish computer support for local government requests for traffic record searches, these expenditures are classifiable as benefitting local programs.</P>
              <P>(d) Waivers. While the local participation requirement may be waived in whole or in part by the NHTSA Administrator, it is expected that each State program will generate political subdivision participation to the extent required by the Act so that requests for waivers will be minimized. Where a waiver is requested, however, it must be documented at least by a conclusive showing of the absence of legal authority over highway safety activities at the political subdivision levels of the State and must recommend the appropriate percentage participation to be applied in lieu of the local share.</P>

              <P>(a) Policy. Federal participation in P&amp;A activities shall not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of such activities, or the applicable sliding scale rate in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120. The Federal contribution for P&amp;A activities shall not exceed 13 percent of the total funds the State receives under 23 U.S.C. 402. In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120(i), the Federal share payable for projects in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be 100 percent. The Indian country, as defined by 23 U.S.C. 402(h), is exempt from these provisions. NHTSA funds <PRTPAGE P="658"/>shall be used only to finance P&amp;A activities attributable to NHTSA programs.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Direct costs</E> are those costs identified specifically with a particular planning and administration activity or project. The salary of an accountant on the State Highway Safety Agency staff is an example of a direct cost attributable to P&amp;A. The salary of a DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) enforcement officer is an example of direct cost attributable to a project.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Indirect costs</E> are those costs (1) incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective within a governmental unit and (2) not readily assignable to the project specifically benefited. For example, centralized support services such as personnel, procurement, and budgeting would be indirect costs.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Planning and administration (P&amp;A) costs</E> are those direct and indirect costs that are attributable to the management of the Highway Safety Agency. Such costs could include salaries, related personnel benefits, travel expenses, and rental costs specific to the Highway Safety Agency.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Program management costs</E> are those costs attributable to a program area (e.g., salary and travel expenses of an impaired driving program manager/coordinator of a State Highway Safety Agency).</P>
              <P>(c) Procedures. (1) P&amp;A activities and related costs shall be described in the P&amp;A module of the State's Highway Safety Plan. The State's matching share shall be determined on the basis of the total P&amp;A costs in the module. Federal participation shall not exceed 50 percent (or the applicable sliding scale) of the total P&amp;A costs. A State shall not use NHTSA funds to pay more than 50 percent of the P&amp;A costs attributable to NHTSA programs. In addition, the Federal contribution for P&amp;A activities shall not exceed 13 percent of the total funds in the State received under 23 U.S.C. 402 each fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(2) A State at its option may allocate salary and related costs of State highway safety agency employees to one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) P&amp;A;</P>
              <P>(ii) Program management of one or more program areas contained in the HSP; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Combination of P&amp;A activities and the program management activities in one or more program areas.</P>
              <P>(3) If an employee works solely performing P&amp;A activities, the total salary and related costs may be programmed to P&amp;A. If the employee works performing program management activities in one or more program areas, the total salary and related costs may be charged directly to the appropriate area(s). If an employee is working time on a combination of P&amp;A and program management activities, the total salary and related costs may be charged to P&amp;A and the appropriate program area(s) based on the actual time worked under each area(s). If the State Highway Safety Agency elects to allocate costs based on actual time spent on an activity, the State Highway Safety Agency must keep accurate time records showing the work activities for each employee. The State's recordkeeping system must be approved by the appropriate NHTSA Approving Official.</P>

              <P>A. In States where State-submitted information on seat belt use rates does not include data for Front outboard occupants in passenger motor vehicles (FOPV), an adjustment will be made based on the national ratio of seat belt use rates for FOPV to the seat belt use rate for the group of occupants and vehicles that were included in the State-submitted information. The national seat belt use rates will be derived from the most recent National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS). For each affected State, the adjustment will be made by dividing the NOPUS seat belt use rate for FOPV by the NOPUS seat belt use rate for the surveyed group, or the seat belt use rate for the closest available group to the surveyed group. The NOPUS seat belt use rate for FOPV will be derived for each affected State by weighting the NOPUS seat belt use rates for passenger cars and for passenger motor vehicles that are not passenger cars (hereafter LTVs) by the relative number of registrations of passenger cars and LTVs in each State. This method will produce a factor which will be multiplied by the State's survey-based seat belt use rate to produce an adjusted seat belt use rate reflecting the required vehicle and occupant population.</P>

              <P>A. If State-submitted seat belt use rate information is unavailable or inadequate for both calendar years 1996 and 1997, State seat belt use rates for calendars year 1996 and 1997 will be estimated based on seat belt use rates of fatally-injured occupants.

This factor will then be applied to the seat belt use rate from the known year to derive an estimate of the seat belt use rate for the unknown year.</P>

              <P>A. To determine the national average seat belt use rate in a calendar year, each State seat belt use rate for the calendar year will be weighted to reflect the percentage of total national vehicle miles traveled attributable to that State.</P>
              <P>B. If a State seat belt use rate is unavailable for a State during a calendar year (either because the State did not conduct a seat belt use survey or a survey was conducted but does not comply with the Uniform Criteria for State Observational Surveys of Seat Belt Use, 23 CFR Part 1340), NHTSA will calculate a State seat belt use rate, using the last available State seat belt use rate determined under § 1240.11 or § 1240.12 of this part, as applicable, along with information on seat belt use rates from the FARS, and an algorithm relating FARS seat belt use rates to observed seat belt use rates (see Appendix 1, note). This procedure will produce an estimated State seat belt use rate for the unknown calendar year. The estimated State seat belt use rate will then be weighted in the manner described in paragraph A of this appendix.</P>

              <P>C.

NHTSA will adjust the national medical cost figures from this report to individual State income levels to reflect local cost levels. These per-case costs will be further adjusted for inflation, using the most recent annual average Consumer Price Index for medical care, and then multiplied by the injuries and fatalities prevented in each State to derive <PRTPAGE P="678"/>the total medical care savings from increased seat belt use. The Federal portion of these costs will be derived from the best available data found in the same cost report or in other sources, as they may become available.</P>

            <P>(g)(1) If any funds are transferred under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the apportionment of a State under Section 402 for a fiscal year, the amount of obligation authority determined under paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be transferred for carrying out projects described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The obligation authority referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be transferred from the obligation authority distributed for the fiscal year to the State for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs, and the amount shall be determined by multiplying:</P>

            <P>The State's Highway Safety Plan documents a State's highway safety program that is data-driven in establishing performance targets and selecting the countermeasure strategies, planned activities and projects to meet performance targets. Each fiscal year, the State shall submit a HSP, consisting of the following components:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Highway safety planning process.</E> (1) Description of the data sources and processes used by the State to identify its highway safety problems, describe its highway safety performance measures, establish its performance targets, and develop and select evidence-based countermeasure strategies and projects to address its problems and achieve its performance targets;</P>
            <P>(2) Identification of the participants in the processes (e.g., highway safety committees, program stakeholders, community and constituent groups);</P>

            <P>(3) Description and analysis of the State's overall highway safety problems as identified through an analysis <PRTPAGE P="693"/>of data, including but not limited to fatality, injury, enforcement, and judicial data, to be used as a basis for setting performance targets, selecting countermeasure strategies, and developing projects;</P>
            <P>(4) Discussion of the methods for project selection (e.g., constituent outreach, public meetings, solicitation of proposals);</P>
            <P>(5) List of information and data sources consulted; and</P>
            <P>(6) Description of the outcomes from the coordination of the HSP, data collection, and information systems with the State SHSP.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance report.</E> A program-area-level report on the State's progress towards meeting State performance targets from the previous fiscal year's HSP.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Performance plan.</E> (1) List of quantifiable and measurable highway safety performance targets that are data-driven, consistent with the Uniform Guidelines for Highway Safety Programs and based on highway safety problems identified by the State during the planning process conducted under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) All performance measures developed by NHTSA in collaboration with the Governors Highway Safety Association (“Traffic Safety Performance Measures for States and Federal Agencies” (DOT HS 811 025)), as revised in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 402(k)(5) and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> which must be used as minimum measures in developing the performance targets identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that—</P>
            <P>(i) At least one performance measure and performance target that is data-driven shall be provided for each program area that enables the State to track progress toward meeting the quantifiable annual target;</P>
            <P>(ii) For each program area performance measure, the State shall provide—</P>
            <P>(A) Quantifiable performance targets; and</P>
            <P>(B) Justification for each performance target that explains how the target is data-driven, including a discussion of the factors that influenced the performance target selection; and</P>
            <P>(iii) State HSP performance targets are identical to the State DOT targets for common performance measures (fatality, fatality rate, and serious injuries) reported in the HSIP annual report, as coordinated through the State SHSP. These performance measures shall be based on a 5-year rolling average that is calculated by adding the number of fatalities or number of serious injuries as it pertains to the performance measure for the most recent 5 consecutive calendar years ending in the year for which the targets are established. The ARF may be used, but only if final FARS is not yet available. The sum of the fatalities or sum of serious injuries is divided by five and then rounded to the tenth decimal place for fatality or serious injury numbers and rounded to the thousandth decimal place for fatality rates.</P>
            <P>(3) Additional performance measures not included under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For program areas where performance measures have not been jointly developed (e.g., distracted driving, drug-impaired driving) for which States are using HSP funds, the State shall develop its own performance measures and performance targets that are data-driven, and shall provide the same information as required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Highway safety program area problem identification, countermeasure strategies, planned activities and funding.</E> (1) Description of each program area countermeasure strategy that will help the State complete its program and achieve specific performance targets described in paragraph (c) of this section, including, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(i) An assessment of the overall projected traffic safety impacts of the countermeasure strategies chosen and of the planned activities to be funded; and</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the linkage between program area problem identification data, performance targets, identified countermeasure strategies and allocation of funds to planned activities.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(i) A list and description of the planned activities that the State will conduct to support the countermeasure strategies within each program area to address its problems and achieve its performance targets; and</P>
            <P>(ii) For each planned activity (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> types of projects the State <E T="03">plans</E> to conduct), a description, including intended subrecipients, Federal funding source, eligible use of funds, and estimates of funding amounts, amount for match and local benefit.</P>
            <P>(3) Rationale for selecting the countermeasure strategy and funding allocation for each planned activity described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (e.g., program assessment recommendations, participation in national mobilizations, emerging issues). The State may also include information on the cost effectiveness of proposed countermeasure strategies, if such information is available.</P>
            <P>(4) For innovative countermeasure strategies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> countermeasure strategies that are not evidence-based), justification supporting the countermeasure strategy, including research, evaluation and/or substantive anecdotal evidence, that supports the potential of the proposed innovative countermeasure strategy.</P>
            <P>(5) Evidence-based traffic safety enforcement program (TSEP) to prevent traffic violations, crashes, and crash fatalities and injuries in areas most at risk for such incidents, provided that—</P>
            <P>(i) The State shall identify the planned activities that collectively constitute a data-driven TSEP and include—</P>
            <P>(A) An analysis of crashes, crash fatalities, and injuries in areas of highest risk; and</P>
            <P>(B) An explanation of the deployment of resources based on that analysis.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State shall describe how it plans to monitor the effectiveness of enforcement activities, make ongoing adjustments as warranted by data, and update the countermeasure strategies and planned activities in the HSP, as applicable, in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(6) The planned high-visibility enforcement (HVE) strategies to support national mobilizations. The State shall implement activities in support of national highway safety goals to reduce motor-vehicle-related fatalities that also reflect the primary data-related crash factors within the State, as identified by the State highway safety planning process, including participation in the national high-visibility law enforcement mobilizations in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 404. The planned high-visibility enforcement strategies to support the national mobilizations shall include not less than three mobilization campaigns in each fiscal year to reduce alcohol-impaired or drug-impaired operation of motor vehicles and increase use of seatbelts by occupants of motor vehicles.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Teen Traffic Safety Program.</E> If the State elects to include the Teen Traffic Safety Program authorized under 23 U.S.C. 402(m), a description of planned activities, including the amount and types of Federal funding requested, the State match, local benefit as applicable, appropriate eligible use of funds, and applicable performance target that the State will conduct as part of the Teen Traffic Safety Program—a Statewide program to improve traffic safety for teen drivers. Planned activities must meet the eligible use requirements of 23 U.S.C. 402(m)(2).</P>

            <P>(2) If the Administrator has apportioned funds under Section 402 to a State and subsequently determines that the State is not implementing an approved highway safety program, the Administrator shall reduce the apportionment by an amount equal to not less than 20 percent, until such time as the Administrator determines that the State is implementing an approved highway safety program. The Administrator shall consider the gravity of the State's failure to implement an approved highway safety program in determining the amount of the reduction.</P>
            <P>(i) When the Administrator determines that a State is not implementing an approved highway safety program, the Administrator shall issue to the State an advance notice, advising the State that the Administrator expects to withhold funds from apportionment or reduce the State's apportionment under Section 402. The Administrator shall state the amount of the expected withholding or reduction.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State may, within 30 days after its receipt of the advance notice, submit documentation demonstrating that it is implementing an approved highway safety program. Documentation shall be submitted to the NHTSA Administrator, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Apportionment of withheld funds.</E> (1) If the Administrator concludes that a State has begun implementing an approved highway safety program, the Administrator shall promptly apportion to the State the funds withheld from its apportionment, but not later than July 31 of the fiscal year for which the funds were withheld.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If the Administrator concludes, after reviewing all relevant documentation submitted by the State or if the State has not responded to the advance notice, that the State did not correct its failure to have or implement an approved highway safety program, the Administrator shall issue a final notice, advising the State of the funds being withheld from apportionment or of the reduction of apportionment under Section 402 by July 31 of the fiscal year for which the funds were withheld.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Administrator shall reapportion the withheld funds to the other States, in accordance with the formula specified in 23 U.S.C. 402(c), not later than the last day of the fiscal year.</P>

Chapter 4 and Section 1906 shall be subject to an assessment of risk by NHTSA. In evaluating risks of a State highway safety program, NHTSA may consider, but is not limited to considering, the following for each State:</P>
            <P>(i) Financial stability;</P>
            <P>(ii) Quality of management systems and ability to meet management standards prescribed in this part and in 2 CFR part 200;</P>

            <P>(iv) Reports and findings from audits performed under 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, or from the reports and findings of any other available audits; and</P>
            <P>(v) The State's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, and other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities.</P>
            <P>(2) If a State is determined to pose risk, NHTSA may increase monitoring activities and may impose any of the specific conditions of 2 CFR 200.207, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-compliance.</E> If at any time a State is found to be in non-compliance with the requirements of the grant programs under this part, the requirements of 2 CFR parts 200 and 1201, or <PRTPAGE P="717"/>with any other applicable law, the actions permitted under 2 CFR 200.207 and 200.338 may be applied as appropriate.</P>
