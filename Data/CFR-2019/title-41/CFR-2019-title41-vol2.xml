      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <P>GSA is currently providing various centralized services to Federal agencies in such fields as office and storage space, supplies and materials, communications, records management, transportation services, and printing and reprographics. Other centralized CASU's may be providing supporting services or activities such as health units, use of training devices and facilities, pistol ranges, and central facilities for receipt and dispatch of mail. Consolidation and sharing is frequently feasible with resulting economies in personnel, equipment, and space. Opportunities to effect economies through planned consolidation of such services occur particularly during the design stage of the construction of new Federal buildings, or the renovations to existing buildings. Opportunities may also occur as a result of needs <PRTPAGE P="28"/>assessments jointly conducted by local agencies.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Basis for determining economic feasibility.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Whenever possible, determination of the economic feasibility of a proposed centralized service shall be based upon standard data on the relationship of the size of the Federal building, the number of occupants, location, and other factors pertinent to the type of centralized service being considered.</P>
                <P>(b) In the absence of standard data on which a determination of economic feasibility can be based, or where such data must be supplemented by additional factual information, a formal feasibility study may be made by GSA or a CASU workgroup, in coordination with local agencies to be involved, prior to a final determination to proceed with the furnishing of a centralized service. Generally, a formal feasibility study will be made only if provision of the proposed centralized service would involve the pooling of staff, equipment, and space which occupying agencies otherwise would be required to use in providing the service for themselves. Examples of centralized services which may require formal studies include printing and duplicating plants and similar facilities.</P>
                <P>(c) On the basis of experience under the centralized services program, GSA will develop criteria as to cost comparisons, production needs, building population, number of agencies involved, and other appropriate factors for consideration in determining the practicability of establishing various types of centralized services.</P>

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the head of each agency affected will be advised of the Administrator's determination and of the reasons therefor. Each determination to provide a centralized service shall include a formal report containing an explanation of the advantages to be gained, a comparison of estimated annual costs between the proposed centralized operation and separate agency operations, and a statement of the date the centralized facility will be fully operational.</P>
                <P>(b) While a formal appeals procedure is not prescribed, any agency desiring to explain its inability to participate in the use of a centralized service may do so through a letter to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to the Administrator of General Services.</P>

                <P>(a) GSA will continually appraise the operation of centralized facilities to insure their continued justification in terms of economy and efficiency. Centralized services provided pursuant to the regulation may be discontinued or curtailed if no actual savings or operating improvements are realized after a minimum operating period of one year. Occupying agencies will be consulted regarding the timing of curtailment or discontinuance of any centralized services and the heads of such agencies notified at least 120 days in advance of each action.</P>

                <P>This subpart 101-5.3 is applicable to all Federal agencies which occupy space in or are prospective occupying agencies of a building or group of adjoining buildings managed by GSA.</P>
              </SECTION>

                <SECTNO>§ 101-5.302</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
                <P>It is the objective of GSA to provide or arrange for appropriate health service programs in all Government-owned and leased buildings, or groups of adjoining buildings, which it manages where the building population warrants, where other Federal medical facilities are not available, and, where the number of the occupying agencies indicating a willingness to participate in such a program on a reimbursable basis makes it financially feasible.</P>

              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 101-5.303</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Guiding principles.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following principles will control the scope of the health services to be provided in keeping with the objective:</P>
                <P>(a) Employees who work in groups of 300 or more, counting employees of all departments or agencies who are scheduled to be on duty at one time in the same building or group of buildings in the same locality will constitute the minimum number of employees required to warrant the establishment of a health service of a scope specified in § 101-5.304.</P>
                <P>(b) As an exception to paragraph (a) of this section, health services of the scope specified in § 101-5.304 may be provided for employees who work in groups of less than 300 where the employing department or agency determines that working conditions involving unusual health risks warrant such provision.</P>

                <P>(c) Treatment and medical care in performance-of-duty cases will be provided to employees as set forth in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 751 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
                <P>(d) Reimbursable costs for providing health services will be based on an operating budget which is a summary of all costs required to operate the health service. The reimbursement cost is prorated to participating agencies by means of a per capital formula computed by dividing the operating budget of the health service by the total number of employees sponsored for service. The size of the Federal population served, the compensation of the employees of the health unit, and other factors of medical economics prevalent in the area are factors which affect the local reimbursement cost. Further, in appropriate cases where more than one health unit is servicing employees housed in the same general locality, costs may be equalized by combining the operating budgets of all such units and dividing the total of the operating budgets by the number of employees sponsored. Special industrial conditions or other abnormal health or accident risk environments may increase the per capita cost.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Type of occupational health services.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The type of occupational health services made available to occupying agencies will be as follows:</P>

                <P>(a) Emergency diagnosis and first treatment of injury or illness that become necessary during working hours and that are within the competence of the professional staff and facilities of the health service unit, whether or not such injury was sustained by the employee while in the performance of duty or whether or not such illness was caused by his employment. In cases where the necessary first treatment is outside the competence of the health service staff and facilities, conveyance of the employee to a nearby physician or suitable community medical facility <PRTPAGE P="31"/>may be provided at Government expense at the request of, or on behalf of, the employee.</P>
                <P>(b) Preemployment examinations of persons selected for appointment.</P>
                <P>(c) Such inservice examinations of employees as the participating agency determines to be necessary, such as voluntary employee health maintenance examinations which agencies may request for selected employees. Such examinations may be offered on a limited formula plan to all participating agencies when the resources of the health service staff and facilities will permit. Alternatively, when agencies are required to limit the cost of an occupational health services program, the provision of inservice examinations may be provided to selected employees of individual agencies and reimbursed on an individual basis.</P>
                <P>(d) Administration, in the discretion of the responsible health service unit physician, of treatments and medications</P>
                <P>(1) Furnished by the employee and prescribed in writing by his personal physician as reasonably necessary to maintain the employee at work, and</P>
                <P>(2) Prescribed by a physician providing medical care in performance-of-duty injury or illness cases under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</P>
                <P>(e) Preventive services within the competence of the professional staff</P>
                <P>(1) To appraise and report work environment health hazards as an aid in preventing and controlling health risks;</P>
                <P>(2) To provide health education to encourage employees to maintain personal health; and</P>
                <P>(3) To provide specific disease screening examinations and immunizations.</P>
                <P>(f) In addition, employees may be referred, upon their request, to private physicians, dentists, and other community health resources.</P>

                <P>This subpart provides the regulations of the General Services Administration (GSA) under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d—2000d-7) concerning nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs in connection with which Federal financial assistance is extended under laws administered in whole or in part by GSA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The purpose of this subpart is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from GSA.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 101-6.203</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Application of subpart.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, this subpart applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered in whole or in part by GSA, including the laws listed in § 101-6.217. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to any such program after the effective date <PRTPAGE P="34"/>of this subpart pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This subpart does not apply to (1) Any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended to any such program before the effective date of this subpart, except to the extent otherwise provided by contract, (3) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (4) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 101-6.204-2(d). The fact that a statute which authorizes GSA to extend Federal financial assistance to a program or activity is not listed in § 101-6.217 shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such program is not covered. Other statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(b) The regulations issued by the following Departments pursuant to title VI of the Act shall be applicable to Federal financial assistance of the kind indicated, and those Departments shall respectively be responsible for determining and enforcing compliance therewith:</P>
                <P>(1) Department of Health, Education, and Welfare—donation or transfer of surplus property for purposes of education or public health (§ 101-6.217 (a)(2) and (b)).</P>
                <P>(2) Department of Defense—donation of surplus personal property for purposes of civil defense (§ 101-6.217(a)(2)).</P>
                <P>(3) Department of Transportation—donation of property for public airport purposes (§ 101-6.217(c)). GSA will, however, be responsible for obtaining such assurances as may be required in applications and in instruments effecting the transfer of property.</P>
                <P>(4) Department of the Interior—disposal of surplus real property, including improvements, for use as a public park, public recreational area, or historic monument (§ 101-6.217(d) (1) and (2)). GSA will, however, be responsible for obtaining such assurances as may be required in applications and in instruments effecting the transfer of property for use as a historic monument.</P>
                <P>(5) Department of Housing and Urban Development—disposal of surplus real property for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing to be occupied by families or individuals of low or moderate income (§ 101-6.217(q)).</P>
                <P>(c) Each Department named in paragraph (b) of this section shall keep GSA advised of all compliance and enforcement actions, including sanctions imposed or removed, taken by it with respect to the types of Federal financial assistance specified in paragraph (b) of this section to which the regulations of such Department apply.</P>

                <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
                <P>(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>

                <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, <PRTPAGE P="35"/>quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
                <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise, or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (d) of this § 101-6.204-2).</P>
                <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) This subpart does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the ground of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this subpart applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.</P>
                <P>(b) As used in this § 101-6.204-2 the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(c) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this § 101-6.204-2 does not limit the generality of the pro hibition in § 101-6.204-1.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including, but not limited to, recruitment or recruitment advertising; employment; layoff or termination; upgrading, demotion, or transfer; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; selection for training, including apprenticeship; and use of facilities). The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or the corresponding provisions of any Executive order which supersedes it.</P>

                <P>(2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this subpart tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits <PRTPAGE P="36"/>of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this subpart, to the extent necessary to insure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>

                <P>(a) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this subpart 101-6.2 applies, except an application to which § 101-6.205-2 applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart 101-6.2. In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible GSA official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
                <P>(b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which is acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by GSA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible GSA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Administrator may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumberance remains effective.</P>

                <P>(c) The assurance required in the case of a transfer of personal property shall <PRTPAGE P="37"/>be inserted in the instrument effecting the transfer of the property.</P>
                <P>(d) In the case of Federal financial assistance not involving a transfer of property, the assurance required shall be inserted in the agreement executed between the United States and the recipient covering the extension of Federal financial assistance.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Illustrative applications.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions of this subpart to certain programs for which Federal financial assistance is extended by GSA (in all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, <PRTPAGE P="38"/>color, or national origin, prohibited by title VI of the Act and this subpart):</P>
                <P>(a) In the programs involving the transfer of surplus property for airport, park or recreation, historic monument, wildlife conservation, or street widening purposes (§ 101-6.217(c), (d), (e), and (h)), the public generally is entitled to the use of the facility and to receive the services provided by the facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith, without segregation or any other discriminatory practices.</P>
                <P>(b) In the program involving the loan of machine tools to nonprofit institutions or training schools (§ 101-6.217(o)), discrimination by the recipient in the admission of students or trainees or in the treatment of its students or trainees in any aspect of the educational process is prohibited. In the case of an institution of higher education, the prohibition applies to the entire institution. In the case of elementary or secondary schools, the prohibition applies to all elementary and secondary schools of the recipient school district, consistent with § 101-6.205-3. In this and other illustrations the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the recipient.</P>
                <P>(c) In the programs involving the donation of personal property to public bodies or the American National Red Cross (§ 101-6.217 (f) and (j)), discrimination in the selection or treatment of individuals to receive or receiving the benefits or services of the program is prohibited.</P>

                <P>(d) In the program involving the donation of personal property to eleemosynary institutions (§ 101-6.217(<E T="03">1</E>)), the assurance will apply to applicants for admission, patients, interns, residents, student nurses, and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the institution, and will apply to the entire institution and to facilities operated in connection therewith.</P>
                <P>(e) In the programs involving the allotment of space by GSA to Federal Credit Unions, without charge for rent or services, and the provision of free space and utilities for vending stands operated by blind persons (§ 101-6.217 (i) and (k)), discrimination by segregation or otherwise in providing benefits or services is prohibited.</P>
                <P>(f) In the program involving grants to State and local agencies and to nonprofit organizations and institutions for the collecting, describing, preserving, and compiling and publishing of documentary sources significant to the history of the United States (§ 101-6.217(n)), discrimination by the recipient in the selection of students or other participants in the program, and, with respect to educational institutions, in the admission or treatment of students, is prohibited.</P>
                <P>(g) In the program involving the transfer of surplus real property for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing to families or individuals of low or moderate income (§ 101-6.217(q)), discrimination in the selection and assignment of tenants is prohibited.</P>
                <P>(h) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this subpart forbids it to accomplish directly.</P>
                <P>(i) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 101-6.209-4 to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity and the rights of beneficiaries under this subpart have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will ensure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.</P>

                <P>(j) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In <PRTPAGE P="39"/>such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.</P>

                <P>(b) For purposes of this subpart, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs.</P>
                <P>(c) Despite the existence of permissible separate or different aid, benefits, or services, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different.</P>

The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, and the plan must meet with the approval of the Director of Civil Rights, GSA. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. At a minimum, the plan shall:</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Historic Preservation Programs</E> are those that receive Federal financial assistance that has preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic properties</E> means those properties that are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Substantial impairment</E> means a permanent alteration that results in a significant loss of the integrity of finished materials, design quality or special character.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Obligation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Accessibility.</E> A recipient shall operate any program or activity involving Historic Preservation Programs so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>
                <FP>This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing historic properties or every part of an historic property accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Methods of achieving accessibility include:</FP>
                <P>(i) Making physical alterations which enable handicapped persons to have access to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;</P>
                <P>(ii) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;</P>
                <P>(iii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties;</P>
                <P>(iv) Adopting other innovative methods to achieve accessibility.</P>
                <FP>Because the primary benefit of an Historic Preservation Program is the experience of the historic property itself, in taking steps to achieve accessibility, recipients shall give priority to those means which make the historic property, or portions thereof, physically accessible to handicapped individuals.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiver of accessibility standards.</E> Where accessibility cannot be achieved without causing a substantial impairment of significant historic features, the Administrator may grant a waiver of the accessibility requirement. In determining whether accessibility can be achieved without causing a substantial impairment, the Administrator shall consider the following factors:</P>
                <P>(i) Scale of property, reflecting its ability to absorb alterations;</P>
                <P>(ii) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private purpose;</P>
                <P>(iii) Importance of the historic features of the property to the conduct of the program or activity; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Cost of alterations in comparison to the increase in accessibility.</P>
                <FP>The Administrator shall periodically review any waiver granted under this section and may withdraw it if technological advances or other changes so warrant.</FP>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Advisory Council comments.</E> Where the property is federally owned or where Federal funds may be used for <PRTPAGE P="59"/>alterations, the comments of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation shall be obtained when required by section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), and 36 CFR part 800, prior to effectuation of structural alterations.</P>

                <P>Any age distinctions contained in a rule or regulation issued by GSA are presumed to be necessary to the achievement of a statutory objective of the program or activity to which the rule or regulation applies. The GSA regulation 41 CFR 101-44.207(a) (3) through (27), describes specific Federal <PRTPAGE P="62"/>financial assistance which provides assistance to all age groups.

                <P>(b) Recipient assessment of age distinctions.</P>
                <P>(1) As part of a compliance review under § 101-8.715 or complaint investigation under § 101.8.718, GSA may require a recipient employing the equivalent of 15 or more employees to complete a written self-evaluation of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from GSA to assess the recipient's compliance with the Act.</P>
                <P>(2) If an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the GSA regulation, the recipient takes corrective action.</P>

                <P>Each recipient must:</P>
                <P>(a) Keep records in a form and containing information that GSA determines necessary to ensure that the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation.</P>
                <P>(b) Provide to GSA upon request, information and reports that GSA determines necessary to find out whether the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation.</P>
                <P>(c) Permit reasonable access by GSA to books, records, accounts, facilities, and other sources of information to the extent GSA finds it necessary to find out whether the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation. GSA adopts HHS policy regarding the kinds of data and information recipients are expected to keep (45 CFR 90.34). This policy is parallel to compliance information sections in the title VI, title IX, and section 504 implementation regulations. While recognizing the need for enough data to assess recipient compliance, GSA is committed to lessening the data gathering burden on recipients. GSA further recognizes that there is no established body of knowledge or experience to guide the assessment of age discrimination. This regulation, therefore, does not impose specific data requirements upon recipients, rather, it allows GSA to be flexible in deciding what kinds of data should be kept by recipients, based on what kinds of data prove useful as GSA gains experience with the Age Discrimination Act, and age discrimination issues become clearer.</P>
                <P>(d) In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 59-511), the reporting and record keeping provisions included in this regulation will be submitted, for approval, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). No data collection or record keeping requirement will be imposed on recipients or donees without the required OMB approval number.</P>

                <P>(a) GSA may conduct compliance reviews and use similar procedures to investigate and correct violations of the Act and this regulation. GSA may conduct the reviews even in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. The reviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violation of the Act and this regulation has occurred.</P>
                <P>(b) If a compliance review indicates a violation of the Act or this regulation, GSA attempts to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If compliance cannot be achieved, GSA arranges for enforcement as described in § 101-8.720.</P>

                <P>(a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class (defined at § 101-8.703(e)) or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with GSA alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act or this regulation based on an action occurring after July 1, 1979. A complainant must file a complaint within 80 days from the date the complainant first has knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, GSA may extend this time limit.</P>
                <P>(b) GSA considers the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient to be processed.</P>
                <P>(c) GSA attempts to facilitate the filing of complaints if possible, including taking the following measures:</P>
                <P>(1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement that identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes the action or practice complained of, and is signed by the complainant;</P>
                <P>(2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint;</P>
                <P>(3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representative) of their right to contact GSA for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.</P>
                <P>(d) GSA returns to the complainant any complaint outside the jurisdiction of this regulation, and states the reason(s) why it is outside the jurisdiction of the regulation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Mediation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) GSA promptly refers to the mediation agency designated by the Secretary, HHS, all sufficient complaints that:</P>
                <P>(1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and this regulation, unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception; and</P>
                <P>(2) Contain the information needed for further processing.</P>
                <P>(b) Both the complainant and the recipient must participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgement that an agreement is not possible. Both parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.</P>
                <P>(c) If the complainant and the recipient agree, the mediator will prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it. The mediator must send a copy of the agreement to GSA. GSA takes no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Investigation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Informal investigation.</E> GSA investigates complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement. As part of the initial investigation, GSA uses informal factfinding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and the recipient, to establish the fact and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. GSA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency. GSA puts any agreement in writing and has it signed by the parties and an authorized official designated by the Administrator or the Director, Office of Organization and Personnel. The settlement may not affect the operation of any other enforcement efforts of GSA, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints that may involve the recipient. The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Formal investigation.</E> If GSA cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it begins to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, GSA attempts to obtain voluntary compliance. If GSA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it begins enforcement as described in § 101-8.720.</P>

                <P>(1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from GSA under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this regulation. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.</P>
                <P>(2) Any other means authorized by law including, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceeding to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipients created by the Act or this regulation, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that has the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this regulation.</P>
                <P>(b) GSA limits any termination to the particular recipient and program or activity or part of such program or activity GSA finds in violation of this regulation. GSA does not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from GSA.</P>
                <P>(c) GSA takes no action under paragraph (a) until:</P>
                <P>(1) The administrator advises the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and this regulation and determines that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, and</P>
                <P>(2) 30 calendar days elapse after the Administrator sends a written report of the grounds of the action to the committees of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Administrator files a report if any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section .</P>
                <P>(d) GSA may also defer granting new Federal financial assistance from GSA to a recipient when a hearing under § 101-8.721 is initiated.</P>
                <P>(1) New Federal financial assistance from GSA includes all assistance for which GSA requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from GSA does not include assistance approved before the beginning of a hearing.</P>

                <P>(2) GSA does not begin a deferral until the recipient receives notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 101-8.721. GSA does not continue a deferral <PRTPAGE P="65"/>for more than 60 calendar days unless a hearing begins within that time or the time for beginning the hearing is extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Administrator. GSA does not continue a deferral for more than 30 calendar days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.</P>
                <P>(3) GSA limits any deferral to the particular recipient and program or activity or part of such program or activity GSA finds in violation of these regulations. GSA does not base any part of a deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not, and would not, receive Federal financial assistance from GSA.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action; and either fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible GSA official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a data has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act, and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at GSA in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the Director, Office of Civil Rights (OCR), unless he or she determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of GSA requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and GSA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both GSA and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevent evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the Officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearings. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by this part, may be reimbursed for his travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.</P>

                <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to <PRTPAGE P="66"/>examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advances on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated of Joint Hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute non-compliance with this regulation with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part, and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the responsible GSA official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 101-8.722.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Decisions and notices.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Decisions by hearing examiners.</E> After a hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Agency designated reviewing authority for final decision. A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for GSA may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by GSA official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with his or her reasons therefore. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue a decision including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority.</E> Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.</E> Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 101-8.721(a) the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing examiner for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of a hearing examiner or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each findings, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Review in certain cases by the Administrator.</E> If the Administrator has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for GSA may request the Administrator to review a decision of the Reviewing Authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Administrator determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Administrator may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. He or she may also review such a decision in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. In the absence of a review under this paragraph, a final decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) of this section shall become the final decision of GSA when <PRTPAGE P="67"/>the Administrator transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the report required under section 602 of the Act. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the Reviewing Authority or to request review under this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this regulation, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this regulation, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this regulation unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible GSA official that it will fully comply with this regulation.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Post-termination proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that is will fully comply with this part.</P>
                <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible GSA official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible GSA official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he or she shall restore such eligibility.</P>
                <P>(3) If the responsible GSA official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

                <P>(a) This § 101-25.101 prescribes general criteria governing selection of the appropriate methods of supply to be utilized in meeting the planned requirements of the Government. It is directly applicable to executive agencies, and other Federal agencies are requested to observe these criteria in conducting their supply operations.</P>

                <P>Consumable and low value items in inventory (cupboard stocks are not considered inventory) are subject to accounting and inventory record controls in accordance with applicable provisions of law and the principles and standards prescribed by the General Accounting Office, 2 GAO 12.5. Normally, however, the systems of control for such property cease at the time of issuance from a warehouse or storeroom to the consumer.</P>

                <P>(a) The guidelines set forth in this § 101-25.107 are considered minimum to assure proper use of consumable or low cost items by individuals, subsequent to issue from accountable records and termination of formal accountability. Consumable items, for the purpose of this section, are considered to include those items actually consumed in use (e.g., pads and pencils) and those items <PRTPAGE P="76"/>required in performance of duties but for which, primarily by reason of the low value involved, no formal accountability is maintained after issue, and are generally referred to as “expendable.”</P>
                <P>(b) Approval of requisitions for replenishment of cupboard storeroom stocks should be restricted to officials at a responsible supervisory level to ensure that supply requirements are justified on the basis of essentiality and quantity. Where requisitions are not required, such as in obtaining items from GSA customer supply centers, informal “shopping lists” should be approved at the same level.</P>
                <P>(c) Adequate safeguards and controls should be established to assure that issues of expendable supplies are made for official use only. In appropriate situations, this will include identification of individuals to whom expendable supplies have been issued. Experience has indicated, also, that certain items of expendables should not be displayed either at seasonal periods of the year or on a permanent basis.</P>

                <P>(d) The items listed below have from experience proven to be personally attractive and particularly susceptible to being used for other than official duties. Agencies should give special attention to these and any other consumable or low cost items when issues are excessive when compared with normal program needs.

                <P>(b) Equipment pools shall be established in Federal laboratories so that laboratory and research equipment can be shared or allocated on a temporary basis to laboratory activities and individuals whose average use does not warrant the assignment of the equipment on a permanent basis. In determining the number and location of equipment pools, consideration shall be given to economy of operation, mobility of equipment, accessibility to users, frequency of use of the equipment, and impact on research programs. Pooling operations should begin expeditiously, within 120 days, if feasible, following decisions regarding the number and location of pools. If it is determined that an equipment pool would not be practical or economical or for any other reason is not needed at a particular laboratory, a written report supporting that determination shall be submitted to the agency head or his designee. Federal laboratories which do not meet the size and staffing criteria in § 101-25.109-2(a) should also establish equipment pools whenever feasible; however, these facilities need not submit written reports regarding determinations not to establish pools.</P>
                <P>(c) Where the establishment of a physical pool would be economically unfeasible due to excessive transportation and handling costs, limited personnel resources, or limited space, pooling may be accomplished by means of equipment listings. Consideration should be given to the establishment of a laboratory advisory committee consisting of technical and management personnel to determine the types of equipment to be shared or pooled and to identify equipment that is no longer required.</P>
                <P>(1) Equipment pools may also be used to fill requests for temporary replacements while permanently assigned equipment is being repaired or to provide equipment for new laboratories pending acquisition of permanent equipment.</P>

                <P>The regulations issued by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR part 574, Tire Identification and Recordkeeping, require that tire manufacturers maintain or have maintained for them the name and address of tire purchasers, the identification number of each tire sold, and the name and address of the tire seller (or other means by which the manufacturer can identify the tire seller). In addition, distributors and dealers are required to furnish such data to manufacturers in connection with purchases made directly from them. GSA provides support to the Federal Government for tires, and therefore has prescribed the following procedures for tires purchased from or through GSA supply sources.</P>

The objective of such legislation is, among other things, the improvement of the relationship between people and their environment and the lessening of hazards affecting their health and safety.

Further, the Federal regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items supplied through the Federal supply system that are known to contain components or possess qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Each agency, therefore, shall take action as necessary to ensure that the objectives and directives of the National Environmental Policy Act, other environmental statutes, and applicable regulations are met; especially the directive that environmental concerns, effects, and values shall be given appropriate <PRTPAGE P="79"/>consideration with economic and technical issues in decisionmaking. Action should include a continuing review of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and issuances promulgated by the Federal regulatory agencies for guidance applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items that are known to contain components or to possess qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions.</P>

                <P>(b) A number of agencies, representing the majority users according to dollar volume, request GSA to make purchases and contracts exclusively for a given item or item groups of articles and services even though not “common-use” items as defined in § 101-25.203(a); and</P>
                <P>(c) GSA is best equipped to do the buying based upon the factors listed in § 101-25.202, or must of necessity act as the central purchasing office when other agencies more appropriately suited to make central purchases do not do so and are not so directed by the President; and</P>

                <P>(a) The Administrator of General Services has determined, based upon the factors listed in § 101-25.202, that a selected executive agency is best equipped to perform certain purchasing and contracting functions, and the Administrator of General Services has issued appropriate regulations designating the categories of articles or services complying with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 101-25.203 that are to be purchased exclusively by the named executive agency under authority delegated by the Administrator of General Services; and</P>
                <P>(b) The head of the designated executive agency has issued appropriate instructions, or a Federal Supply Schedule, under authority as delegated by and in the form approved by the Administrator, specifically designating the item or item groups of articles or services that are thereafter to be purchased exclusively for all executive agencies, or with specified limited exceptions, by the designated executive agency.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Furniture.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Furniture (office, household and quarters, and institutional) shall not be replaced unless the estimated cost of repair or rehabilitation (based on GSA term contracts), including any transportation expense, exceeds at least 75 percent of the cost of a new item of the same type and class (based on prices as shown in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog, applicable Federal Supply Schedules, or the lowest available market price). An exception is authorized in those unusual situations in which rehabilitation of the furniture at 75 percent or less of the cost of a new item would not extend its useful life for a period compatible with the cost of rehabilitation as determined by the agency head or his designee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Materials handling equipment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Materials handling equipment will not be replaced unless the estimated cost of necessary one-time repair or reconditioning of each piece of equipment exceeds, at lowest available cost, the applicable percentage of acquisition cost as shown in column 3 of the following table. Equipment eligible for replacement under the criteria established by this standard may be repaired provided the expected economical life is extended commensurate with the expenditure required. Prior to incurring repair costs for equipment eligible for replacement, consideration should be given to the continuing availability of repair parts.</P>
                <P>(1) Years in use shall be determined in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(i) An operating month is considered equal to 100 operating hours. For materials handling equipment in storage, one month in storage equals 50 hours of operation.</P>

                <P>(ii) The number of years in use is determined by dividing the number of operating months by 12. The fractional years in use resulting from this computation will be rounded to the nearest full year.<PRTPAGE P="84"/>

                <P>(2) In using the maximum allowable one-time repair limits in column 3 of the table, costs such as parts, labor, and transportation incident to the repairs, are to be included in computing one-time repair costs. However, operating expenses such as fuels and lubricants, replacement tires and batteries, and antifreeze will not be included in the one-time repair cost estimate.</P>
                <P>(b) Notwithstanding the limitations prescribed in § 101-25.405(a), materials handling equipment may be replaced under the following conditions provided a written justification supporting such replacement is approved by the agency head or an authorized designee. The justification shall be retained in the agency files.</P>
                <P>(1) When the cumulative repair costs on a piece of equipment appears to be excessive as indicated by repair records. However, because an item of equipment accrues repair costs equal to the acquisition cost, it is not necessarily indicative of the current condition of the equipment. For example, a substantial repair expenditure included in the cumulative cost may actually have resulted in restoring the equipment to as good as new condition. While cumulative repair costs suggest an area for investigation, they should not be used as the principal ingredient in the repair/replacement decision making process.</P>
                <P>(2) When repair parts are not available causing excessive equipment out-of-service time.</P>
                <P>(3) When the equipment lacks essential features required in a particular task which is of a continuing nature and other suitable equipment is not readily available.</P>

              <P>This part prescribes policies and procedures which govern the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services by Federal agencies from or through GSA supply sources as established by law or other competent authority. The specific subparts or sections covering the subject matter involved prescribe the extent to which the sources of supply are to be used by Government agencies. Certain civilian and military commissaries and nonappropriated fund activities are also eligible to use GSA supply sources for their own use, not for resale, unless otherwise authorized by the individual Federal agency and concurred in by GSA. Policy and procedures pertaining to purchasing of property or contracting for services from commercial sources, without recourse to established GSA supply sources, are provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1).</P>

                <P>GSA provides lines of similar items to meet particular end-use requirements under the GSA stock program, special order program (SOP) established source, and the Federal Supply Schedule program. Although these similar items may differ in terms of price, quality, and essential characteristics, they often can serve the same functional end-use procurement needs of the various ordering agencies. Therefore, in submitting requisitions or placing delivery orders for similar items obtainable from GSA sources, agencies shall utilize the source from which the lowest cost item can be obtained which will adequately serve the functional end-use purpose.</P>

                <P>Waiver requests, when required by § 101-26.102-1 (special order program established source items), § 101-26.301 (GSA stock items) or § 101-26.401-3(b) (Federal Supply Schedule items), shall be submitted to the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service (F), General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20406. Waiver requests will be approved if considered justified. Approval of a waiver request does not constitute authority for a sole source procurement. Depending on the basis for the waiver request, each request shall contain the following information:</P>
                <P>(a) Waiver requests based on determination that the GSA item is not of the requisite quality or will not serve the required functional end-use purpose of the agency requesting the waiver shall include the following information with each request:</P>
                <P>(1) A complete description of the type of item needed to satisfy the requirement. Descriptive literature such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures which show the characteristics or construction of the type of item or an explanation of the operation should be furnished whenever possible.</P>
                <P>(2) The item description and the stock number (NSN if possible) of the GSA item being compared. Inadequacies of the GSA items in performing the required functions.</P>
                <P>(3) The quantity required. (If demand is recurrent, nonrecurrent, or unpredictable, so state.)</P>
                <P>(4) The name and telephone number of the person to be contacted when questions arise concerning the request.</P>
                <P>(5) Other pertinent data, when applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) Waiver request based on determination that the GSA item can be purchased locally at a lower price shall include the following information with each request. However, the price alone of an item without other substantive consideration will not be considered sufficient justification to approve a waiver request.</P>
                <P>(1) A complete description of the type of item needed to satisfy the requirement.</P>
                <P>(2) The quantity required. (If demand is recurrent, nonrecurrent, or unpredictable, so state.)</P>
                <P>(3) The destination of item to be delivered.</P>
                <P>(4) The name and address of source.</P>
                <P>(5) A price comparison with the GSA item, including the NSN of the GSA item. Cost comparisons shall include the agency administrative cost to effect the local purchase.</P>
                <P>(6) The name and telephone number of the person to be contacted when questions arise concerning the request.</P>
                <P>(7) Other pertinent data, when applicable.</P>
                <P>(c) When the item is a Standard or optional form available from GSA stock, the provisions of § 101-26.302 apply.</P>
                <P>(d) Agencies shall not initiate action to procure similar items from non-GSA sources until a request for a waiver has been requested from and approved by GSA. The fact that action to procure a similar item has been initiated will not influence GSA action on a request for waiver.</P>

                <P>(e) Waivers are not required for items or services procured in accordance with the policy set forth in § 101-26.100-1 relating to the acquisition of the lowest cost item from GSA sources, § 101-26.401-4(f) relating to the purchase of products that are available at prices lower than the prices of identical products provided by multiple award Federal Supply Schedule contracts, or when an urgent requirement exists in <PRTPAGE P="88"/>accordance with FAR 6.302-2 (48 CFR 6.302-2).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Warranties.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Through its procurement sources and programs GSA provides for certain types of items and services which are covered by warranties. Such warranties allow ordering activities additional time after acceptance within which to assert a right to correct certain deficiencies in supplies or services furnished. The additional time period and the specific corrective actions for which the contractor is responsible are usually stated in the warranty. Items and services subject to warranties are normally identified by a warranty marking or notice. Such marking or notice will state that a warranty exists, its extent of coverage, its duration, and whom to notify concerning defects. Using activities shall take the following actions when items or services (except for automotive vehicles and components which are subject to the provisions of § 101-26.501-6) covered by warranty provisions are found to be defective during the warranty period.</P>
                <P>(a) Activities shall attempt to resolve all complaints where a warranty is involved. If the contractor replaces the item or corrects the deficiency, a Standard Form (SF) 368, Product Quality Deficiency Report, in duplicate, shall be sent to the GSA Discrepancy Reports Center (6FR), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088. The resolution of the case should be clearly stated in the text of the SF 368. This information will be maintained as a quality history file for use in future procurements.</P>
                <P>(b) If the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to replace, a defective item or an aspect of service under the warranty, an SF 368, in duplicate, along with copies of all pertinent correspondence, shall be submitted to the contracting officer in the appropriate GSA commodity center for necessary action. The address of the contracting officer is contained in the contract/purchase order, except for schedule items where the address is shown in the Federal Supply Schedule.</P>

                <P>The special buying services of GSA are performed through the GSA special order program (SOP). The SOP allows an agency to obtain items not included in either the GSA stock or Federal Supply Schedule program. All executive agencies within the United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), in order to maximize the use of the Government's centralized supply system, shall request SOP items by submitting requisitions for GSA centrally managed items to GSA. GSA will process all requisitions for SOP items, regardless of total line item value, from activities electing to purchase from GSA. If an agency determines that alternative sources are more favorable, procurement from other sources is authorized: Provided, that the dollar thresholds and criteria outlined in § 101-26.301(b)(1) through (3) are followed.</P>

                <P>When GSA performs the purchasing services for other agencies or activities as contemplated by this § 101-26.102-3, <PRTPAGE P="89"/>calculation of the delivery dates required for the items involved must be based on the procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide. These leadtimes are based on the normal time required after receipt of agency requisitions by GSA to effect delivery to destinations within the 50 States.</P>
                <P>(a) Time required to obtain any additional essential information from the requisitioning office for use in issuing a solicitation for bids or offers is not included in the leadtimes.</P>
                <P>(b) If unusually large quantities or complex items are required, leadtime adjustments should be made to reflect the specific requirement. As an example, standard furniture items can usually be delivered in less than 90 days after receipt of the requisition. However, for large quantity or complex orders requiring a definite quantity procurement, delivery times may range from 4 to 6 months. Footnotes relating to classes where this is a frequent occurrence are shown in the procurement leadtime table illustrated in the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide.</P>
                <P>(c) The procurement leadtime table illustrated in the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide does not apply to public exigency or other high priority requisitions; however, it should be used as a guide to establish realistic required delivery dates for such requisitions.</P>

These items fall into the category of “luxury items” since they do not contribute to the fulfillment of missions normally assigned to Federal agencies.</P>

                <SUBJECT>End-of-year submission of requisitions for action by GSA.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Purchase documents for supplies or services submitted to GSA at or near the close of a fiscal year shall reflect actual agency requirements and shall not be used as a means of exhausting appropriation balances.</P>
                <P>(b) Under the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP systems, the requisitions submitted to GSA are not required to reflect the applicable appropriation or fiscal year funds to be charged. The fund code entry on the requisition simply indicates to the supply source (GSA) that funds are available to pay the charge, thereby providing authority for the release of material and subsequent billing. Requisitions received by GSA in purchase authority format are normally converted to FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP documentation so that processing can be accomplished expeditiously through a uniform system based on the use of automated equipment. Accordingly, primary responsibility rests with the ordering activity for ensuring that requisitions intended to be chargeable to appropriations expiring the last day of the fiscal year are submitted in sufficient time for GSA to consummate the necessary action before the end of the fiscal year. Requisitions submitted on or before the last day of the fiscal year may be chargeable to appropriations expiring on that date provided the ordering agency is required by law or GSA regulation to use GSA supply sources. When the ordering agency is not required to use GSA sources, requisitions for GSA stock items may be recorded as obligations provided the items are intended to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which the need arises or to replace stock used in that fiscal year; requests for other than GSA stock items are to be recorded as obligations at the time GSA awards a contract for the required items. In the latter case, GSA procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, should be used as a guide for timely submission of these requisitions. The leadtimes referred to relate to the number of days between submission of a requisition and actual delivery of the items involved. While this may furnish some guidance to requisitioners, there is no direct relationship between those leadtimes and the time it takes for GSA to make an award of a contract.</P>
                <P>(c) End-of-year submission of requisitions which require GSA to award a contract not later than the last day of the fiscal year in order to obligate the appropriation or funds of the ordering agency will be annotated to indicate that GSA procurement of the requested items must be accomplished not later than the last day of the fiscal year in which the requisitions are submitted. For example, a FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP requisition should be prepared to include Document Identifier Code A0E or A05 and reflect the annotation in the “Remarks” block. With this information GSA will attempt to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year. When a requistion is received too late to permit GSA to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year, the requisitioning activity will be so notified and requested to furnish instructions regarding the action to be taken. Based on these instructions, procurement action will be taken or the requisition will be canceled and returned to the ordering activity.</P>

If the requisitioning agency has prior knowledge that a requisition will require procurement without providing for full and open competition (e.g., sole source acquisition), sufficient information shall be included with the requisition to allow GSA to justify the procurement. Specifically, the information must include the following:<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
                </P>
                <P>(a) The specific needs to be satisfied in terms of identified tasks or work processes;</P>

                <P>(c) The characteristics of the designated item that enable it to satisfy the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;</P>
                <P>(d) The identification of other items evaluated and, for each, a statement of the characteristics (or lack thereof) which preclude their satisfying the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;</P>
                <P>(e) The citation of the applicable law, if any, authorizing other than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302 (48 CFR 6.302); and</P>

                <P>Full consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual small volume requirements to enable the Government to benefit from lower prices normally obtainable through definite quantity contracts for larger volume procurements. This policy pertains to procurement from commercial sources either directly or through an intermediary agency and does not apply to GSA stock items or small volume requirements normally obtained from GSA customer supply centers. When it is practical, each agency shall establish procedures that will permit planned requirements consolidation on an agencywide basis. When it is impractical to plan requirements on an agencywide consolidated basis, the requirements consolidation effort may be limited to a bureau, to other agency segments, or to a program, if such limited consolidation will provide significant price advantages when procurement is effected on a volume basis. Requisitions for item requirements exceeding maximum order limitations in Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to GSA in accordance with the applicable instructions in the respective schedules. Special buying services desired by agencies for procurement of other consolidated item requirements shall be requested from GSA in accordance with § 101-26.102.</P>

                <P>This requisitioning and issue system is identified as the Federal Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (FEDSTRIP) and is similar to and compatible with the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP). The FEDSTRIP system provides GSA and other supply sources the means to automate the processing of requisitions. Detailed instructions required to implement FEDSTRIP are contained in the GSA Handbook, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101-26.2), which is issued and maintained by the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service, GSA.</P>

                <P>To obtain items through the FEDSTRIP system, each ordering activity is required to have an activity address code. The FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101-26.2) contains instructions to civilian agencies on requesting activity address codes. Once <PRTPAGE P="92"/>assigned, an activity address code allows an activity to order supplies under the FEDSTRIP system. Because there is a potential for abuse in the use of these codes, agencies shall establish stringent internal controls to ensure that the codes are used only by authorized personnel. It is imperative that all requests for activity address codes or deletions or address changes flow through a central contact point in the agency headquarters or regions where the need, purpose, and validity of the request can be verified. Agencies should send GSA the addresses of the contact points (mailing address: General Services Administration (FSR), Washington, DC 20406). GSA will only honor requests from the established points within the agency. GSA will periodically send a listing of current activity address codes and addresses to contact points for review.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
                <P>All executive agencies within the United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), in order to maximize the use of the Government's centralized supply system, shall requisition GSA stock items in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(a) When the requirement is for Standard and optional forms, an item produced by the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), or an item listed in the procurement list published by the Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped (NIB-NISH), the dollar thresholds and language indicated in paragraph (b) of this section are not applicable and acquisition of such items continues to be as set forth in the applicable sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Federal Property Management Regulations and other appropriate regulations. In order to identify FPI/NIB-NISH items stocked by GSA, they are marked with an asterisk in the GSA Supply Catalog NSN index,</P>
                <P>(b) GSA will process all requisitions for stock items, regardless of total line item value, from activities electing to purchase from GSA. If an agency determines that alternative sources are more favorable, the following guidelines shall apply. However, the price alone of an item without other substantive consideration will not be considered as sufficient justification to use alternative sources. (These guidelines also apply to the procurement of special order program (SOP) established source, see § 101-26.102-1.)</P>
                <P>(1) When the total value of the line item requirement is less than $100, procurement from other sources is authorized.</P>
                <P>(2) When the total value of the line item requirement is $100 or more, but less than $5,000, procurement from other sources is authorized: provided, that a written justification shall be prepared and placed in the purchase file stating that such action is judged to be in the best interest of the Government in terms of the combination of quality, timeliness, and cost that best meets the requirement. Cost comparisons shall include the agency administrative cost to effect a local purchase.</P>

                <P>(3) For total line item requirements of $5,000 and over, agencies shall submit a requisition to GSA unless a waiver has been approved by GSA. Request <PRTPAGE P="93"/>for waivers shall be submitted in accordance with § 101-26.100-2.</P>
                <P>(c) Agencies shall not divide requisitions to avoid higher threshold documentation requirements.</P>
                <P>(d) In authorizing procurements in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, agencies shall reimburse GSA for any cost arising out of breach of a GSA contract, where sufficient justification is not documented in their procurement files.</P>

                <P>(b) When an agency determines that items available from GSA stock will not serve the required functional end-use purpose of the item proposed to be procured, a request to waive the requirement to use this source shall be submitted to GSA for consideration in accordance with the provisions of § 101-26.100-2.</P>

                <P>Agencies shall obtain Standard and optional forms by requisitioning them from GSA (FSS) unless the forms have been approved by GSA (KMPS) to be stocked and distributed by the promulgating agency or to be reproduced locally. Assistance or information on the forms management program may be obtained by contacting GSA (KMPS), Washington, DC 20405. (See part 201-45, subpart 201-45.5 of this chapter.)</P>
                <P>(a) For purposes of economy, existing stocks are depleted prior to issuance of revisions unless the promulgating agency determines previous editions unusable and obsolete.</P>
                <P>(b) Forms or form assemblies which deviate from the standard and optional forms listed in the GSA Supply Catalog have restricted use and are not stocked. Agencies requiring such forms shall prepare and transmit a Standard Form 1, Printing and Binding Requisition, or Standard Form 1-C, Printing and Binding Requisition for Specialty Items, to the General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service (FCNI), Washington, DC 20406, for review and submission to GPO. Prior approval of GSA (KMPS) is required whenever the content or construction of a form is altered or modified. Requests for such exceptions may be obtained by submission of a SF 152, Requests for Clearance of a Standard or Optional Form or Exception, to GSA (KMPS), with appropriate justification.</P>
                <P>(c) Certain standard forms are serially numbered and are to be accounted for to prevent possible fraudulent use. The General Accounting Office (GAO) requires accurate accountability records to be maintained for such items by applicable agencies. GSA forwards a receipt verification card with each shipment of accountable forms. The receiving agency is responsible for verifying receipt of the serially numbered forms in the shipment by returning the card to the address preprinted on the card. See § 101-41.308 of this chapter for information governing agency control and disposition of unused U.S. Government Bills of Lading (GBL's).</P>
                <P>(d) Standard and optional forms which are excess to the needs of an agency shall be reported to GSA in the same manner as other excess personal property pursuant to part 101-43 of this chapter. Obsolete forms shall be disposed of under the provisions of part 101-45 of this chapter.</P>

Substitute items may be issued from new stock or from returned stock that is in serviceable condition (condition code A) as described in § 101-27.503-1. A notice of intent to substitute will be provided to the ordering activity only if the characteristics of the substitute item differ substantially from the characteristics of the item requisitioned. Ordering activities may prevent substitution by entering advice code 2B (do not substitute) or 2J (do not substitute or backorder) in cc 65-66 of requisitions.</P>

However, since processing cancellations is costly and interferes with normal order processing, agencies are cautioned to use discretion in requesting cancellation of low dollar value orders. Cancellation of orders may be accomplished by agencies through written, telegraphic, or telephonic communication with the GSA regional office to which the order was sent. However, telephonic communication should be used whenever feasible to forestall shipment of material and subsequent billing by GSA. If material has been shipped, GSA will advise that cancellation cannot be effected and agency requests for return for credit will be processed under the provisions of §§ 101-26.310 and 101-26.311.</P>

                <P>In accordance with the provisions of this § 101-26.310, GSA may authorize agencies to return for credit material that has been ordered in error by the agency. Material shipped in error by GSA is subject to the provisions of the GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101-26.8). Credit for material ordered in error will be based on the selling price billed the agency at the time shipment was made to the agency, with the adjustment reflected in current or future billings. Material shall not be returned until appropriate documentation is received from GSA.</P>

                <P>(a) The return of material by an agency, to correct ordering errors, may be authorized and later accepted by GSA: <E T="03">Provided,</E>

Requests should always contain a complete explanation of reason(s) for return of the material. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis when GSA is in need of the material and extenuating circumstances precluded earlier submission of the request.</P>
                <P>(3) Each item is in “like-new” condition and is identified by a stock number in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog.</P>
                <P>(4) Each item is identified with a specific purchase order or requisition number.</P>
                <P>(5) The condition of the material is acceptable on inspection by GSA. When it is not acceptable, disposition, without credit, will be made by GSA. However, when the condition is attributable to carrier negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by the amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for damages incurred.</P>
                <P>(6) The merchandise to be returned will not adversely affect the GSA nationwide inventory situation.</P>
                <P>(7) The return transportation costs are not excessive in relation to the cost of the material.</P>

                <P>(a) At the request of the ordering agency, GSA may authorize diversion or return for credit of any shipment consigned to an overseas destination which, while en route, cannot be continued onward for any reason and for which the consignee or requisitioning agency cannot provide diversion instructions:

                  <E T="03">Provided,</E> The frustration occurs at a water or air terminal and title to the material has not passed from the Government. Frustrated shipments located outside the United States are the responsibility of the consignee or ordering agency. However, GSA will assist the agency whenever possible in disposing of the material when it cannot be utilized by the overseas control area of the agency, e.g., oversea command or AID area.</FP>
                <P>(b) Requests to GSA for disposition instructions shall be directed to the GSA office which made the shipment. Data provided by the agency shall include the original requisition document number, purchase order number (if any), supplementary addresses, and present location of the frustrated shipment. In addition, the agency should furnish the Government bill of lading number or commercial bill of lading reference, and the carrier's freight or waybill number.</P>
                <P>(c) GSA may direct disposition of such material through any of the means listed below. Disposition instructions will include a determination by GSA as to the responsibility for payment of transportation costs.</P>

                <P>Except as provided for the Department of Defense (DOD) in paragraph (a) of this section, each executive agency shall submit to GSA for procurement its orders for purchase in the United States of all new passenger motor vehicles (FSC 2310), trucks or truck tractors (FSC 2320), trailers (FSC 2330) van type (with payload of not less than 5,000 nor more than 50,000 pounds), and firetrucks and firefighting trailers (FSC 4210). Specifically included are sedans, station wagons, carryalls, ambulances, buses, and trucks, including trucks with specialized mounted equipment, truck chassis with special purpose bodies, and all van-type trailers (with payload of not less than 5,000 nor more than 50,000 pounds).</P>
                <P>(a) DOD shall submit to GSA for procurement its orders for purchase in the United States for all non-tactical vehicles including, but not limited to, commercial-type passenger motor vehicles (FSC 2310), including buses, and trucks and truck tractors (FSC 2320).</P>

                <P>(b) When it is determined by the ordering activity that requirements for passenger motor vehicles and trucks indicate the need for procurement by buying activities other than GSA, a request for waiver justifying the procurement shall be submitted in writing to the General Services Administration (FCA), Washington, DC 20406. GSA will notify agencies in writing whether a waiver has been granted. Justification may be based on the urgency of need or the fact that the vehicle has unique characteristics, such as special purpose body or equipment, requiring the agency personnel to closely supervise installation of the equipment by the contractor; e.g., when a medical van is to be equipped with Government- or contractor-supplied equipment. Requests for procurement through sources other <PRTPAGE P="98"/>than GSA will be handled on an individual basis provided full justification is submitted therefore.</P>
                <P>(c) When it is determined by GSA that procurement of an individual agency requirement by GSA would offer no advantage over local purchase of the item, GSA may grant the ordering activity authority for local purchase. When such a determination is made, the order will be returned to the ordering agency with written authority for local purchase.</P>

                <P>Wherever practical, requirements for motor vehicles will be satisfied under existing standardized buying programs (Indefinite Quantity, Requirements, Federal Supply Schedule contracts).

                <P>(1) Family buys—Large annual consolidated buys for sedans, station wagons, and standard light trucks, purchased in the aggregate by group to the extent practical. These procurements are designed to obtain the best market prices available and are normally definite quantity type with maximum option potential. It is anticipated that resulting contracts will remain in place from approximately mid-November to approximately May 1 (or end of model year closeout).</P>
                <P>(2) Two (2) volume procurements each year for light trucks of the types covered by Federal standard Nos. 292 and 307, but not covered by standardized buying programs or family buys, as previously described. Requisitions to be included under these two procurements should reach the GSA Automotive Commodity Center by June 15 and December 1 respectively.</P>
                <P>(3) Up to three (3) consolidated procurements for medium and heavy trucks and buses of the types covered by Federal standard No. 794, Federal specification Nos. KKK-T-2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, and Federal specification No. KKK-B-1579.</P>

Prior approval of deviations shall be indicated on the requisitions by citing the waiver authorization number.</P>
                <P>(c) GSA Form 1781, Motor Vehicle Requisition, has been specifically designed for agency use to expedite ordering of all vehicles. Agencies are requested to use GSA Form 1781 as a single-line-item requisition for nonstandard as well as standard vehicles. When ordering standard vehicles, the appropriate standard item number for such vehicles equipped to meet specific operational needs may be selected from the applicable table in the Federal standards. Additional systems and equipment may be added by inserting in the “Option Codes” portion of the form the appropriate code for the selected items from the table of options in the standard. When ordering nonstandard vehicles or options, the instructions on the reverse of GSA Form 1781, properly completed, will satisfy the requirements regarding the submission of requisitions as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) Each requisition shall indicate the appropriation fund code to be charged and must bear the original signature of an officer authorized to obligate cited funds.</P>

                <P>(3) For buses, ambulances, and other special duty vehicles which can not be procured under the standardized buying programs or consolidated purchase programs described in §§ 101-26.501-2 and 101-26.501-3, 240 to 270 days from date of award are usually required to effect delivery. However, special purpose vehicles with unique characteristics, such as certain types of firetrucks, may require longer delivery. In such instances, every effort will be made by GSA to facilitate deliveries and keep the requisitioning agencies informed of any unauthorized delay.</P>

Participation in the centralized leasing program is mandatory on all executive agencies of the Federal Government (excluding the Department of Defense and the U.S. Postal Service) within the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC. However, agencies must obtain GSA authorization to lease in accordance with § 101-39.205 prior to using these established mandatory use contracts.

                <P>(a) Packaged petroleum products listed in Federal Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies shall be obtained by submitting requisitions prepared in accordance with the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101-26.2) to the Defense General Supply Center (DGSC), Richmond, Va. 23297, using routing identifier code S9G. The Federal Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies may be obtained, upon written request, from the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, Attn: DLSC-T, Battle Creek, Mich. 49016. Requisitions for packaged petroleum items not in this catalog and not otherwise included in Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) procurements under the provisions of § 101-26.602-1 may be submitted to DGSC. DGSC will supply the items from inventory or will refer the requisitions to DFSC for purchase and direct delivery to the requisitioner. Packaged petroleum items may be obtained from other Federal activities by agreement with the activity concerned or by local purchase when such action is authorized under the provisions of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) local purchase policy contained in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) Activities may effect local purchase of any DLA-managed, centrally procured item, commercially available, provided the purchase:</P>
                <P>(1) Is limited to immediate-use requirements generated by emergency conditions (e.g., work stoppage, etc.), or</P>
                <P>(2) Is to satisfy a routine requirement having a total line value not in excess of $25 and is determined to be the most economical method of supply.</P>
                <P>(c) DGSC may return requisitions for local purchase action citing FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP status code CW with the concurrence of the requisitioning activity when it is deemed that a local purchase action would be the most economical method of supply. A determination will be based on recognition of excessive costs (procurement, transportation/shipping, and special packaging considerations) as compared to those costs associated with local purchase action. Requisition priorities, backorder situations, procurement and required delivery dates (PDD/RDD), and requisition line item dollar values shall not be a basis or consideration for a Status Code CW reject action. Requisitions from overseas activities will not be returned to overseas activities for a local purchase action.</P>

                <P>(c) Contractual information covering these requirements will be furnished each participating agency by the Defense Fuel Supply Center after contracts are awarded. As shipments of coal are required, each activity shall direct the contractor to make delivery. Payment for deliveries shall be arranged for by the ordering activity directly with the contractor. Should estimated requirements not be needed due to changes or conversions in heating equipment or other reasons, activities shall notify the Defense Fuel Supply Center of such changes as soon as possible.</P>

A charge for each sample submitted will be assessed by the Bureau of Mines for performing such analysis, or agencies may enter into an agreement with the Bureau of Mines for services and testing on an annual flat rate basis. Agencies shall furnish the Bureau of Mines laboratory complete billing instructions at the time samples are submitted. Copies of the results of each analysis will be furnished by the Bureau of Mines to offices responsible for payment for comparison with the analytical limits guaranteed by the contractor. In the event that the sample does not meet the minimum requirements of the analytical limits specified in the contract, the using agency shall compute the amount, if any, to be deducted from the contract price.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reporting quality deficiencies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Quality deficiencies are defined as defects or nonconforming conditions which limit or prohibit the item received from fulfilling its intended purpose. Quality deficiencies include deficiencies in design, specification, material, manufacturing, and workmanship. Timely reporting of all quality deficiencies is essential to maintain an acceptable quality level for common-use items. GSA relies on agency reporting of quality deficiencies in order to act to remove the defective items from the supply system as well as to document contractor performance files for use in future procurements.</P>
                <P>(b) A product deficiency which may cause death, injury, or severe occupational illness, or directly restrict the mission capabilities of the using organization, is called a “category I” complaint. Quality complaints that do not meet the category I criteria are called “category II” complaints. Standard Form (SF) 368, Quality Deficiency Report, or a message in the format of the Standard Form 368, is used to report quality deficiencies.</P>
                <P>(c) Standard Form 368 (including SF's 368 submitted in message formats) are required for all product quality deficiencies that involve material (1) shipped to the user from a GSA distribution center (including shipments made directly to the user from GSA distribution centers as well as “indirect” shipments (shipments with intermediate stops between the GSA distribution center and the ultimate user)), (2) shipped to the user from a DOD depot or another Government activity, as directed by GSA, (3) purchased by GSA for the user and inspected by GSA, or (4) ordered from a GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract which specified source inspection by GSA.</P>
                <P>(d) Category I complaints are to be reported to GSA by telephone or telegraphic message within 72 hours of discovery. Category II complaints are to be reported within 15 days after discovery.</P>
                <P>(e) Standard Forms 368 (in triplicate) should be sent to the following address: GSA Discrepancy Reports Centers (6 FR-Q), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088. Communications routing indicator: RUEVFXE (unclassified), RULSSAA (classified), Com: (816) 926-7447, FTS: 926-7447, AUTOVON: 465-7447.</P>
                <FP>In addition, when reporting a category I product quality deficiency condition, an information copy should be sent to the following address: General Services Administration, FSS, Office of Quality and Contract Administration, Quality Assurance Division (FQA), Washington, DC 20406. Communications routing indicator: RUEVFWM (unclassified), RULSSAA (classified), COM: (703) 557-8515, FTS: 557-8515.</FP>
                <P>(f) For defective items covered by a manufacturer's commercial warranty, activities should initially attempt to resolve all complaints on these items themselves (examples of items with a commercial warranty are vehicles, major appliances such as gas and electric ranges, washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators). If the contractor replaces or corrects the deficiency, an SF 368, in triplicate, should be sent to the Discrepancy Reports Center at the above address. The resolution of the case should be clearly stated in the text of the SF 368.</P>

                <P>(g) If, however, the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to replace, either a defective item or an aspect of service under the warranty, an SF 368, along <PRTPAGE P="115"/>with copies of all pertinent correspondence, should be forwarded to the GSA office executing the contract (address will be contained in the pertinent contract/purchase order).

                <P>Each agency shall establish and maintain such control of personal property inventories as will assure that the total cost involved will be kept to the minimum consistent with program needs. For purposes of stock replenishment, inventories may be considered to be composed of active inventory which is that portion carried to satisfy average expected demand, and safety stock which is that portion carried for protection against stock depletion occurring when demand exceeds average expected demand, or when leadtime is greater than anticipated.</P>
                <P>(a) In establishing active inventory levels, consideration shall be given to the average demand of individual items, space availability, procurement costs, inventory carrying costs, purchase prices, quantity discounts, transportation costs, other pertinent costs, and statutory and budgetary limitations.</P>
                <P>(b) In establishing safety stock levels, consideration shall be given to demand and leadtime fluctuations, essentiality of items, and the additional costs required to achieve additional availability.</P>

                <P>Shelf-life items are classified as nonextendable (Type I) and extendable (Type II). Type I items have a definite storage life after which the item or material is considered to be no longer usable for its primary function and should be discarded. Type II items are those for which successive reinspection dates can be established when the items have a continued usability as determined by examination based upon criteria that have been agreed upon. Examples of Type I items are drugs and medicines with certain characteristics. Examples of Type II items are paint and ink.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reducing long supply.</SUBJECT>

                <P>Through effective interagency matching of material and requirements before the material becomes excess, <PRTPAGE P="122"/>unnecessary procurements and investment losses can be reduced. Timely action is required to reduce inventories to their normal stock levels by curtailing procurement and by utilizing and redistributing long supply. (The term <E T="03">long supply</E> means the increment of inventory of an item that exceeds the stock level criteria established for that item by the inventory manager, but excludes quantities to be declared excess.) In this connection, requirements for agency managed items should be obtained from long supply inventories offered by agencies rather than by procurement from commercial sources. Because supply requirements usually fluctuate over a period of time, a long supply quantity which is 10 percent or less of the total stock of the item is considered marginal and need not be reduced.</P>

                <P>When the long supply of an item, including quantities due in from procurement, is greater than 10 percent of the total stock of that item, the inventory manager, or other appropriate official, shall cancel or curtail any outstanding requisitions or procurements on which award has not been made for such items, and may also cancel contracts for such items (if penalty charges would not be incurred) or transfer the long supply, if economical, to other offices within the agency in accordance with agency utilization procedures. In such cases, acquisition of long supply items shall not be made from other sources such as requirements contracts.</P>

                <P>If the long supply of an item remains greater than 10 percent of the total stock of an item despite efforts to cancel or transfer the long supply as provided in § 101-27.303-1, the inventory manager shall offer the long supply to another agency or other agencies in accordance with this § 101-27.303-2. Before offering a long supply to any agency, the inventory manager shall determine whether the item to be offered is a centrally managed item or an agency managed item. A centrally managed item is an item of supply or equipment which forms part of an inventory of an agency performing a mission of storage and distribution to other Government activities; e.g., GSA and DSA. An agency managed item is a procured item that forms a part of a controlled inventory of an agency and its activities for issue internally for its own use. After determining whether the item to be offered is an agency or centrally managed item, the inventory manager shall:</P>
                <P>(a) Offer centrally managed items to the agency managing the item for return and credit in accordance with the procedures established by that agency; and</P>
                <P>(b) Offer agency managed items to other agencies which manage the same item. Reimbursement shall be arranged by the agencies effecting the inventory transfer. The responsibility of locating agencies or activities requiring these items shall rest with the agency holding the long supply. However, agencies may receive a list of Government activities using particular national stock numbers by writing to the General Services Administration (FFL), Washington, DC 20406.</P>

                <P>If a long supply continues to exceed 10 percent of the total stock of an item despite efforts to redistribute the long supply as provided in § 101-27.303-2, the inventory manager shall establish an economic retention limit for the item in accordance with the provisions of this § 101-27.304. An economic retention limit is the maximum quantity of an item that can be held in stock without incurring greater costs for carrying the stock than the costs for disposal and resulting loss of investment. The economic retention limit shall be used to determine which portion of the inventory may be economically retained and which portion should be disposed of as excess.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Establishment of economic retention limit.</SUBJECT>
                <P>An economic retention limit must be established for inventories so that the Government will not incur any more than the minimum necessary costs to provide stock of an item at the time it is required. Generally, it would be more economical to dispose of stock in excess of the limit and procure stock again at a future time when the need is more proximate rather than incur the cumulative carrying costs.</P>
                <P>(a) The agency managing a centrally managed or agency managed item shall establish an economic retention limit so that the total cumulative cost of carrying a stock of the item (including interest on the capital that is tied up in the accumulated carrying costs) will be no greater than the reacquisition cost of the stock (including the procurement or order cost). Consideration should be given to any significant net return that might be realized from present disposal of the stock. Where no information has been issued, the net return from disposal is assumed to be zero. Guidelines for setting stock retention limits are provided in the following table and explanatory remarks that follow:</P>

                <FP>At 25 percent a year, accumulated carrying costs would be equivalent to the reacquisition costs after 3<FR>1/2</FR> years. Three and one-half years is, therefore, the economic retention limit for items with a 25 percent annual carrying cost rate. Where an activity has not yet established an estimate of its carrying cost, an annual rate of 10 percent may be used as an interim rate thereby resulting in an economic retention limit of 7<FR>1/4</FR> years when the net return on disposal is zero. The elements of carrying (holding) cost are given in the GSA Handbook, The Economic Order Quantity Principle and Applications. The handbook is listed in the GSA Supply Catalog and may be ordered in the same manner as other items in the catalog.</FP>
                <P>(b) The economic retention limit at a user stocking activity can best be determined by the item manager (for centrally managed or agency managed items) on the basis of overall Government requirements and planned procurement. Since stocks in long supply at a user stocking activity are less likely to find utilization outlets, the retention limit at these activities should be relatively small. Generally the economic retention limit at a user stocking activity should be computed in the same manner as in paragraph (a) of this section and then reduced by 70 percent.</P>

                <P>By eliminating inactive items and slow-moving items which are readily available, when needed, from Government wholesale supply activities or from commercial sources, the costs to the Government in inventory investment and for maintaining the items in inventory can be eliminated. An “inactive item” is an item for which no current or future requirements are recognized by previous users and the item manager. A “slow-moving item” is an item for which there are current or future requirements, but the frequency and quantity of such requirements do not make it economical to stock them in lieu of obtaining requirements from other sources when needed. However, “standby or reserve items” are not to be eliminated from inventories. A “standby or reserve item” is an item for which a reserve stock is held so that the items will be available immediately to meet emergencies for which there is insufficient time to procure or requisition the items without endangering life or causing substantial financial loss to the Government.</P>

                <P>(a) Within 20 workdays after receipt of an offer to return material, GSA will notify the offering activity of acceptance or rejection of the offer.</P>
                <P>(1) For accepted offers, GSA will inform the offering activity of the GSA material return facility (storage activity) to which the material shall be shipped. Prior to shipment of the material authorized by GSA for return, activities shall verify the declared condition. (If the offering activity considers that the transportation costs of sending the material to the GSA material return facility are excessive in relation to the value of the material and withdraws the offers, the GSA region that was designated to receive the offered material shall be notified accordingly.)</P>

                <P>(b) Upon receipt of material authorized for return by GSA, the offering activity will be provided verification of receipt and a report of any discrepancies. When the discrepant condition is attributable to carrier negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by the amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for any damages incurred. A notice of credit will be provided the offering activity through credit entries on the monthly billing statement from the supporting GSA finance center.</P>
                <P>(c) When offers of material that have been authorized by GSA for return are withdrawn, offering activities shall report such cancellation to the GSA region that was designated to receive the offered material.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The policies and procedures established by this subpart 101-28.2 are primarily applicable to storage activities within the United States. Executive agencies shall make every effort to utilize available Government storage services of other executive agencies to avoid new construction of storage facilities, acquisition of temporary space, and unnecessary transportation of supplies, material, and equipment to distant storage points. Whenever feasible, the policies and procedures shall be used to cross-service storage and warehousing requirements in overseas storage activities. Available storage services of executive agencies shall be made available for cross-servicing the requirements of other Federal agencies when requested. Other Federal agencies are encouraged to participate in cross-servicing arrangements.</P>

                <P>(b) The provisions of this subpart 101-28.2 do not apply to ocean terminals, Government storage activities financed under industrial funds, activities concerned with the storage and handling of bulk fuels (petroleum products), and <PRTPAGE P="128"/>storage functions performed by GSA for the Federal Preparedness Agency.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Cancellation of cross-servicing arrangements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Accepted requests may be canceled by the requesting agency prior to delivery of supplies, material, and equipment to the storage activity when logistical developments make cancellation necessary or cancellation is in the best interest of the Government. The agency which accepted the request shall be informed of the cancellation in writing as soon as possible.</P>
                <P>(b) Cancellation of arrangements in facilities to be inactivated or disposed of by an operating agency may be made as provided for in the GSA/DOD agreement. Also, after supplies, material, and equipment have been received at a storage activity, cancellation may be made when unforeseen emergencies arise which justify such cancellation. Advice of these necessary cancellations shall be in writing to the agency owning the material sufficiently in advance to allow the owning agency the maximum amount of time to make other arrangements for their property.</P>
                <P>(c) When a facility in which cross-servicing is being accomplished is to be transferred from an operating agency to another agency, the operating agency shall inform the agency owning the property at least 90 days before the transfer. The agency owning the property shall negotiate with the agency gaining the facility for continued cross-servicing of the property at the facility. The agency gaining the facility shall continue the cross-servicing arrangements unless they are contrary to the best interest of the Government.</P>

                <P>Items stocked in customer supply centers are based on customer agency requirements for common use expendable items. In addition to administrative type items commonly used in Government offices, janitorial supplies, handtools, and other industrial-type items are stocked when required to meet the mission-related needs of the activities supported by the CSC.</P>

                <P>(a) Each CSC will stock administrative items normally required by Federal agencies for day-to-day operations. In addition to those items, each CSC will stock additional items as determined by the requirements of the activities within the geographic area it serves.<PRTPAGE P="130"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Regional FSS offices will canvass customer agencies periodically to identify items for which there is an official need within their support area.</P>
                <P>(c) Customer agencies may request that specific items be stocked by their support CSC. The requests must be submitted in writing to the appropriate-FSS Bureau Director and must be signed by a customer agency official at a level of responsibility (division director or higher) acceptable to the GSA Regional Administrator. All requests must indicate the expected monthly usage of the item requested. Each request will be evaluated and the submitting activity notified of the results of the evaluation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Prices of customer supply center items.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The selling price of a CSC item is an average price which is calculated automatically by the CSC computer at the time the item is ordered. Items stocked in CSCs that are obtained from GSA wholesale supply distribution facilities are input into the computer at the price in effect at the time of shipment from the facilities (this price is normally the price shown in the GSA Supply Catalog). Items stocked in CSCs that are not available from GSA wholesale supply distribution facilities but which are obtained from other Government supply sources or commercial sources are input into the computer at the invoice cost. Due to cost averaging, item prices listed in the CSC catalog may differ somewhat from the sale price for a particular transaction.</P>

FSS Bureau personnel will provide assistance to agencies in the establishment of the CSC account, brief personnel on the use of the CSC to meet local, retail supply requirements, and provide copies of the CSC catalog.</P>
                <P>(b) An appropriate level management official (division director of higher) authorized to obligate agency funds must sign the GSA Form 3525, Application for Customer Supply Services, requesting establishment of the CSC account for the activity.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of customer supply centers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Orders are received by the CSC via phone, mail, electronic mail, or in person on a walk-in basis for urgent agency requirements. All use of the CSC is based upon the customer access code assigned at the time of establishment of the activity account. The customer access code determines the ship-to point for orders placed with the CSC. The ship-to point cannot be changed, one established, except by the submission of a written request signed by an appropriate agency official.</P>
                <P>(b) All orders placed with the CSC, except emergency pickup orders, described in § 101-28.306-1(c), will be shipped to the activity placing the order via mail or small parcel carrier not later than the end of the next business day.</P>
                <P>(c) Walk-in orders for urgent requirements are accepted and filled immediately provided the individual placing the order has proper identification. Telephone orders placed in the morning may be picked up in the afternoon of the same day provided that the individual picking up the order possesses proper identification and the order ticket number provided by the CSC personnel at the time the order is placed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Limitations on use.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the use of the CSC account by the agency or other authorized activities is limited to the purchase of items for official Government use. The controls shall include written instructions that contain a statement prohibiting the use of the CSC account in acquiring items for other than Government use. When an agency makes a purchase of more than $500 per line item from a GSA customer supply center which is other than a similar lowest priced item available from a multiple-award schedule, GSA will assume that a justification has been prepared and made a part of the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>buying agency's purchase file. Availability of products, regardless of the total amount of the line item price, does not relieve an agency of the responsibility to select the lowest priced item commensurate with needs of the agency.</P>
                <P>(b) Office supplies needed by Members of Congress and the Delegate of the District of Columbia for use in their offices in the House or Senate Office Buildings should be obtained from the Senate and Houses Representatives supply rooms, as appropriate. Members of Congress, except for the Delegate of the District of Columbia, should limit their use of the CSCs to those located outside of the District of Columbia. The Delegate of the District of Columbia may obtain office supplies for the use of his or her district offices from the CSC serving the District of Columbia.</P>

                <P>(a) CSC accounts established for Federal agencies or members of the Federal judiciary are valid for an indefinite period of time unless canceled by the Commissioner, FSS, GSA, or by a GSA Regional Administrator.</P>
                <P>(b) CSC accounts established for authorized contractors or Members of Congress will contain an expiration date reflecting the termination date of the contract or term of office. New accounts will be established for reinstated contractors or reelected Members of Congress upon submission of a new application.</P>
                <P>(c) Any CSC customer may request cancellation of his/her account when no longer required or whenever there is cause to believe that the customer access code has been compromised. Agencies shall keep GSA advised of any changes in organization or accounting structures that might have an impact on their CSC accounts.</P>
                <P>(d) The Commissioner FSS, GSA, may periodically direct a nationwide purge of all CSC accounts to cancel those that are duplicates, not needed, or for which the customer access code has been compromised. Selective account cancellations may be directed by the GSA Regional Administrator in coordination with FSS Central Office. Under the procedures of a nationwide purge, CSC accounts become invalid as of a specific date established by the Commissioner, FSS, GSA, or by a Regional Administrator, and new CSC accounts are established upon receipt of new applications.</P>

                <P>Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the customer access codes assigned for their accounts are properly protected. It is by use of these access codes that orders are accepted by the CSC and these codes determine the ship-to points for all orders filled by the CSC with the exception of orders picked up at the CSC by the customer. GSA will not change the ship-to location associated with the customer access code except upon receipt of a written request to do so, signed by a duly authorized official of the customer activity.</P>

Each customer activity shall take all appropriate measures necessary to ensure that all items are properly controlled within its activity and are purchased solely for official Government use.</P>

                <P>Federal and interim Federal specifications, their associated Federal qualified products lists (QPL's), Federal and interim Federal standards and Commercial item descriptions (CID's) are referred to collectively as Federal product descriptions. They are developed by GSA or other Federal agencies under the Assigned Agency Plan described in the “Federal Standardization Handbook” issued by the Assistant Administrator for Federal Supply and Services (FSS). Product descriptions are coordinated with other Federal agencies having technical, statutory, or regulatory interest in the commodity or other subject matter covered. Generally, before they are issued, Federal product descriptions are reviewed by technical societies, individual industrial producers, and organizations representing industrial producers and consumers.</P>

                <P>(a) Federal Catalog System publications contain selected data from the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) files chosen, assembled, and formatted to meet recognized needs for information in support of assigned missions, functions, and related responsibilities. Most publications are produced in microfiche form; however, some are produced in hard copy form. The following publications are available:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Master cross-reference list.</E> A microfiche publication which contains a master list of national stock numbers (NSN's) cross-referenced to and from manufacturers' part numbers, specifications, or reference drawings. This publication is used to cross-relate reference numbers and stock numbers or to ascertain the manufacturer of an item when the reference number or the NSN is known.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Identification list (IL).</E> A microfiche publication arranged by Federal supply class and containing descriptions of items in the DLSC file. The principal uses of the IL are to obtain or verify an NSN when only the characteristics of the item are known or descriptive data when the NSN is known, and to determine interchangeable or substitutable items.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Consolidated Management Listing.</E> A microfiche publication which is a consolidated listing of NSN's and related supply management data of each integrated manager and military service. These data include Government source of supply, unit of issue, unit price, etc.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Federal item logistics data records (FILDR).</E> A microfiche publication containing complete identification data in tabular format for all descriptive-type item identifications. The data are arranged in NSN sequence within Federal supply class. An FILDR is known in hard copy form as a DD-146 card which is furnished as an output to authorized receivers of Federal catalog data who cannot use other available output media.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Federal Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies.</E> This publication (available in hard copy only) includes NSN's for which DLA is the single source of supply for civil agencies. These NSN's may not necessarily have a DOD user recorded. The publication contains descriptive and management data for items not usually listed in the GSA catalog but which might be required by civil agencies.</P>
                <P>(b) Agencies may obtain without charge copies of the DLA Federal Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies, described in paragraph (a)(6) <SU>1</SU>
                  <FTREF/> of this section by contacting the Defense Logistics Services Center, DLSC-TP, Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49016. To obtain copies of the publications described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section, agencies may submit a request in writing to the same address shown above, except that the applicable mail distribution code is DLSC-AP.

                <P>As a result of participation in the Federal catalog system, activities may receive data directly from DLSC tailored to their individual needs in support of their own supply management data system. The two basic categories of file maintenance are:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Simplified file maintenance (SFM).</E> Subscribers to this category of file maintenance are provided replacement files (magnetic tape) semiannually containing selected technical and supply management data for those items on which they are a registered user. The subscriber will also receive a monthly maintenance update and cumulative monthly basic records from DLSC <PRTPAGE P="146"/>which may be used to maintain the semiannual basic file. Recipients of this form of file maintenance have latitude in selecting those items which meet the needs of their supply system from the categories of data available from the Federal Catalog System.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Regular file maintenance (RFM).</E> This form of the file maintenance provides activities with data on a daily basis as transactions affect items upon which they are a registered user. It is used primarily by those activities which consider it essential to maintain file compatibility with the DLSC file at all times.</P>

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Item reduction study</E> means the study of a group of generally similar items which are subject to evaluation by physical and performance characteristics. This evaluation process identifies items determined to be unnecessarily similar or uneconomical for Government use and which will be considered for removal from Government supply systems. For items so identified, a replacement item shall be proposed. The result of item reduction studies will indicate items which are authorized for procurement or not authorized for procurement.</P>

                <P>(b) GSA, as the civil agency coordinating activity for item reduction studies originated by both GSA and DOD, will:</P>

                <P>(1) Distribute proposed item reduction studies, as appropriate, to all civil agencies recorded as users of the item <PRTPAGE P="151"/>in the DLSC data base. This distribution will be made by coordination letters in which a time frame for a response will be specified. GSA will interpret each nonresponse to a proposed study to mean that the activity concurs with the study. Extensions, when requested by an agency, normally will be granted by GSA.</P>
                <P>(2) Respond to questions concerning proposed item reduction studies.</P>
                <P>(3) Prepare a consolidated civil agency position paper (including comments and nonconcurrences) relative to each study upon receipt of user responses.</P>
                <P>(4) Incorporate civil agency positions into proposed item reduction studies prepared by GSA or forward a consolidated civil agency position paper to appropriate preparing activities.</P>
                <P>(5) Resolve controversies arising from proposed item reduction study recommendations.</P>
                <P>(6) Review approved item reduction studies to ensure that concurrences and nonconcurrences from all civil agencies are accurately reflected.</P>
                <P>(7) Register into the Federal catalog system, data base approved item reduction decisions concerning items within the FSC classes which are managed by GSA.</P>
                <P>(8) Implement decisions documented in approved item reduction studies within the GSA supply system.</P>
                <P>(9) Distribute approved item reduction studies to all recorded civil agency users. All civil agencies (except direct submitters of catalog data to DLSC) will also be forwarded covering letters which will request specific information relative to implementing the studies; i.e., inventory levels of items coded ISC 3. Activities not responding within the time frame specified (60 calendar days) will receive a followup notice before being automatically withdrawn as users of all items coded as not authorized for procurement.</P>

                <P>(b) Prepare and submit written comments on the proposed study to GSA within the time frame specified in the GSA coordination letter, concur with the study, or nonconcur on specific proposed standardization relationships. If comments cannot be prepared and submitted within the time frame specified, an extension shall be requested from GSA.</P>
                <P>(c) Review the approved item reduction study and notify GSA in writing if the activity is to be retained or deleted as a user of any item coded as “not authorized for procurement.” This notification will allow the preparer of the study to complete coordination of the study and update the DLSC Total Item Record (TIR).</P>
                <P>(d) Implement within the agency those item reduction decisions resulting from the study.</P>
                <P>(e) Request, as appropriate, the retention of a nonstandard item in their supply system by forwarding a letter to General Services Administration (FRIS), Washington, DC 20406. The request shall include but not be limited to the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) The specific end-use of end-item application;</P>
                <P>(2) A technical explanation comparing the physical and functional characteristics of the nonstandard item with each authorized-for-procurement item;</P>
                <P>(3) The duration of the requirement for the item or how long the end-item will be retained in the agency's supply system; and</P>
                <P>(4) Economic considerations from a technical standpoint. GSA will evaluate the request and inform the agency of its acceptance or rejection.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>GSA will conduct studies of the operation and costs of motor vehicle and motor vehicle services in selected geographical areas to determine the advisability of establishing fleet management systems.</P>
                <P>(a) Based on these studies, the Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of the affected agencies, shall develop necessary data and cost statistics for use in determining the feasibility of establishing a fleet management system in the geographical area studied.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Administrator, GSA, determines that a fleet management system shall be established, a formal determination is prepared to that effect.</P>
                <P>(c) In the event the Administrator, GSA, decides that the establishment of a fleet management system is not feasible, the head of each agency concerned will be notified.</P>
                <P>(d) In the making of determinations for the establishment of fleet management systems, the Administrator, GSA, will, to the extent consistent with the provisions of section 1(b) of Executive Order 10579, observe the policies outlined in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, for the utilization of commercial facilities.</P>
                <P>(e) Except as provided in this subpart, all Government motor vehicles subsequently acquired for official purposes by fully participating agencies which are stored, garaged, or operated within the defined mandatory use service area of a fleet management system shall also be consolidated into and operated under the control of that system.</P>
                <P>(f) Fleet management systems established under this subpart provide for furnishing motor vehicles and related services to executive agencies. So far as practicable, these services will also be furnished to any mixed-ownership corporation, the District of Columbia, or a contractor authorized under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR part 51, subpart 51.2, upon request. Such services may be furnished, as determined by the Administrator, GSA, through the use, under rental or other arrangements, of motor vehicles of private fleet operators, commercial companies, local or interstate common carriers, or Government-owned motor vehicles, or combinations thereof.</P>

                <P>(2) The number and types of vehicles required, of which passenger vehicles are limited to compact or smaller unless the agency head or designee has certified that larger vehicles are essential to the agency's mission;</P>
                <P>(3) Location where the vehicles are needed;</P>
                <P>(4) Date required, including earliest and latest acceptable dates;</P>
                <P>(5) Anticipated length of assignment;</P>
                <P>(6) Projected utilization, normally in terms of miles per month or year;</P>
                <P>(7) Certification of funding;</P>
                <P>(8) Billing address and billed office address code (BOAC);</P>
                <P>(9) Agency contact, including name, address, and telephone number;</P>
                <P>(10) Office, program, or activity requiring the vehicles;</P>
                <P>(11) A statement that the agency does or does not request authority to commercially lease, and the anticipated duration of the lease, should GSA be unable to provide the vehicles.</P>
                <P>(c) Federal agencies that meet the following conditions are considered other than fully participating:</P>
                <P>(1) Vehicles have been acquired from other sources for reasons other than the inability of the GSA IFMS to supply the required vehicles, except those designated as exempt vehicles as determined by the GSA IFMS;</P>
                <P>(2) Cost reimbursable contractors authorized to utilize GSA IFMS motor vehicles when they represent participating agencies;</P>
                <P>(3) Other authorized users of the GSA IFMS.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The objective of the General Services Administration (GSA) Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) is to provide efficient and economical motor vehicle and related services to participating agencies. To attain this objective, policies and procedures for use and care of GSA IFMS vehicles provided to an agency or activity are prescribed in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) To operate a motor vehicle furnished by the GSA IFMS, civilian employees of the Federal Government shall have a valid State, District of Columbia, or Commonwealth operator's license for the type of vehicle to be operated and some form of agency identification. Non-Government personnel, such as contractors, shall have a valid license for the type of equipment to be operated when using vehicles supplied by the GSA IFMS (this may include a Commercial Driver's License). All other vehicle operators, and Federal civilian employees that have a valid civilian operator's license, but not for the type of equipment to be operated, must have in their possession an Optional Form 346, U.S. Government Motor Vehicle Operator's Identification Card, for the type of equipment to be operated. Specific regulations covering procedures and qualifications of Government motor vehicle operators are contained in 5 CFR part 930, issued by the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
                <P>(c) To operate a motor vehicle furnished by GSA, drivers and occupants shall wear safety belts whenever the vehicle is in operation. The vehicle operator shall ensure that all vehicle occupants are wearing their safety belts prior to operating the vehicle.</P>
                <P>(d) The use of tobacco products is prohibited in GSA IFMS motor vehicles. The agency to which the vehicle is assigned is responsible for ensuring that its employees do not use tobacco products while occupying IFMS vehicles. If a user agency violates this prohibition, the agency will be charged for the cost of cleaning the affected vehicle(s) beyond normal detailing procedures to remove tobacco odor or residue or repairing damage caused as a result of tobacco use. The decision to perform such additional cleaning or repair will be made by the GSA fleet manager based upon the condition of the vehicle when assigned, the degree of tobacco residue and damage, and the cost effectiveness of such additional cleaning.</P>
                <P>(e) Reasonable diligence in the care of GSA IFMS vehicles shall be exercised by using agencies and operators at all times. Officials or employees failing to take proper care of motor vehicles issued to them may be refused further authorization to use GSA IFMS vehicles after reasonable notice has been provided by GSA to the head of the local activity concerned.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Responsibility for damages.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) GSA will charge the using agency all costs resulting from damage, including vandalism, theft, and parking lot damage, to a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle which occurs during the period that the vehicle is assigned or issued to that agency, to an employee of that agency, or to the agency's authorized contractor; however, the using agency will not be held responsible for damages to the vehicle if it is determined by GSA, after a review on a case by case basis of the documentation required by § 101-39.401, that damage to the vehicle occurred:</P>
                <P>(1) As a result of the negligent or willful act of a party other than the agency (or the employee of that agency) to which the vehicle was assigned or issued and the identity of the party can be reasonably determined;</P>
                <P>(2) As a result of mechanical failure of the vehicle, and the using agency (or its employee) is not otherwise negligent. Proof of mechanical failure must be submitted; or</P>
                <P>(3) As a result of normal wear and tear such as is expected in the operation of a similar vehicle.</P>
                <P>(b) Agencies using GSA IFMS services will be billed for the total cost of all damages resulting from neglect or abuse of assigned or issued GSA IFMS vehicles.</P>
                <P>(c) If an agency is held responsible for damages, GSA will charge to that agency all costs for removing and repairing the GSA IFMS vehicle. If the vehicle is damaged beyond economical repair, GSA will charge all costs to that agency, including fair market value of the vehicle less any salvage value. Upon request, GSA will furnish an accident report, where applicable, regarding the incident to the agency. Each agency shall be responsible for disciplining its employees who are guilty of damaging GSA IFMS vehicles through misconduct or improper operation, including inattention.</P>
                <P>(d) If an agency has information or facts that indicate that it was not responsible for an accident, the agency may furnish the data to GSA requesting that costs charged to and collected from it be credited to the agency. GSA will make the final determination of agency responsibility based upon Government findings, police accident reports, and any available witness statements.</P>
                <P>(e) When contractors or subcontractors of using agencies are in accidents involving GSA IFMS vehicles, the agency employing the contractor will usually be billed directly for all costs associated with the accident. It will be the responsibility of the using agency to collect accident costs from the contractor should the contractor be at fault.</P>
