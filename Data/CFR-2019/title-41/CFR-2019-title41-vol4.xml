      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the FTR?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The FTR is the regulation contained in 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapters 300 through 304, which implements statutory requirements and Executive branch policies for travel by Federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at Government expense.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of the FTR?</SUBJECT>
              <P>There are two principal purposes:</P>
              <P>(a) To interpret statutory and other policy requirements in a manner that balances the need to assure that official travel is conducted in a responsible manner with the need to minimize administrative costs;</P>
              <P>(b) To communicate the resulting policies in a clear manner to Federal agencies and employees.</P>

                <E T="03">Appraised value sale</E>—Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee accepts the offer from the RSC to buy the employee's home based upon the average of a specific number of appraisals conducted by designated certified appraisers.</P>

The buy-out offer from the contractor is based on a bona fide offer received by the employee from a qualified buyer after marketing by the employee. Once a bona fide offer is received by the employee, the contractor offers to buy the home from the employee at a price based on the outside sale price.</P>

                <P>Your agency must select the method most advantageous to the Government, when cost and other factors are considered. Under 5 U.S.C. 5733, travel must be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and commensurate with the nature and purpose of your duties. In addition, your agency must consider energy conservation, total cost to the Government (including costs of per diem, overtime, lost worktime, and actual transportation costs), total distance traveled, number of points visited, and number of travelers.</P>

                <P>(b) Using coach-class service, unless other than coach-class service is authorized under § 301-10.123 or § 301-10.162, and when travelling by ship, using lowest first-class accommodations, unless other than lowest first-class accommodations are authorized under § 301-10.183 of this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(c) You must always use U.S. Flag Air Carrier (or ship) service for air passenger transportation or when travelling by ship, unless your travel circumstances meet one of the exceptions in §§ 301-10.135 through 301-10.138 or § 301-10.183 of this subpart.</P>

                  <P>If you are a civilian employee of an agency as defined in § 301-1.1 of this chapter, you must always use a contract city-pair fare for scheduled air passenger transportation service unless one of the limited exceptions in § 301-10.107 exist.

                  <P>(b) The contractor's flight schedule is inconsistent with explicit policies of your Federal department or agency with regard to scheduling travel during normal working hours;</P>

                  <SUBJECT>What classes of airline accommodations are available?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Airlines are constantly updating their offerings. However, for the purposes of this regulation, the classes of available air accommodations are identified and defined as follows:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Coach-class.</E> The basic class of accommodation by airlines that is normally the lowest fare offered regardless of airline terminology used. For reference purposes only, coach-class may also be referred to by airlines as “tourist class,” “economy class,” or as “single class” when the airline offers only one class of accommodations to all travelers.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Other than coach-class.</E> Any class of accommodations above coach-class, e.g., first-class or business-class.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">First-class.</E> The highest class of accommodation offered by the airlines in terms of cost and amenities. This is generally termed “first-class” by airlines and reservation systems.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Business-class.</E> A class of accommodation offered by airlines that is higher than coach and lower than first-class, in both cost and amenities. This class of accommodation is generally referred to as “business, business elite, business first, world business, connoisseur, or envoy” depending on the airline.
                  </P>
                  <NOTE>
                    <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to § 301-10.121:</HD>

                    <P>If an airline flight has only two classes of accommodations available, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, two “cabins”, with two distinctly different seating types (such as girth and pitch) and the front cabin is termed “business-class” or higher by the airline and the tickets are fare-coded as business-class, then the front of the cabin is deemed to be other than coach-class. Alternatively, if an airline flight has only two cabins available but equips both with one type of seating, (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, seating girth and pitch are the same in both cabins), and the seats in the front of the airplane are fare coded as full-fare economy class, and only restricted economy fares are available in the back of the aircraft, then the entire aircraft is to be classified as coach-class seating. In this second situation, qualifying for other than coach-class travel is not required to purchase a non-restricted economy fare seat in the front of the aircraft as the entire aircraft is considered “coach-class.”</P>

                  <P>Government travelers are required to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business when making official travel arrangements, and therefore, should consider the least expensive class of travel that meets their needs.

                  <P>(B) An approximate duration of the special accommodation; and</P>
                  <P>(C) A recommendation as to the suitable class of transportation accommodations based on the disability.</P>
                  <P>(ii) A special need must be certified annually in writing according to your agency's procedures. However, if the special need is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required;</P>
                  <P>(iii) If you are authorized under § 301-13.3(a) of this Subchapter to have an attendant accompany you, your agency may also authorize the attendant to use other than coach-class accommodations if you require the attendant's services en route;</P>
                  <P>(3) When exceptional security circumstances require other than coach-class airline accommodations. Exceptional security circumstances are determined by your agency and should only be authorized up to the minimum other than coach-class accommodation necessary.

                  <P>(1) When use of other than coach-class is necessary to accommodate a medical disability or other special need.</P>
                  <P>(i) A disability must be certified annually in a written statement by a competent medical authority. However, if the disability is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required. Certification statements must include at a minimum:</P>

                  <P>Sometimes these programs are called “Coach Elite,” “Coach Plus,” “Preferred Coach” or some other identifier. Under these airline programs, a passenger may obtain for a fee a more desirable seat choice within the coach-class cabin. These airline upgrade or preferred seat choices are generally available for an annual fee, at an airport kiosk or gate or as a frequent flier perk. These coach upgrade options are not considered a new or higher class of accommodation since the seating is still in the coach cabin. However, the use of these upgraded/preferred coach seating options is generally a traveler's personal choice and therefore is at the traveler's personal expense. An agency travel authorization approving official or his/her designee (e.g., supervisor of the traveler) may authorize and reimburse the additional seat choice fee according to internal agency policy (see 301-70.102(k)).</P>

                  <P>(a) Your agency must determine that use of a rental vehicle is advantageous to the Government and must specifically authorize such use.</P>
                  <P>(b) When authorized to use a rental vehicle, you should consider renting a vehicle from a vendor that participates in the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) U.S. Government Car Rental Agreement to avail yourself of the Agreement's benefits, including the insurance and damage liability provisions, unless you are OCONUS and no agreement is in place for your TDY location. The advantages of renting a car through the DTMO rental car program are:</P>
                  <P>(1) Rental car agreements are pre-negotiated;</P>
                  <P>(2) The agreement includes automatic unlimited mileage and collision damage insurance; and</P>
                  <P>(3) The rates established by the car rental agreement cannot be exceeded by the vendor.</P>
                  <P>(c) Travelers must use the least expensive compact car available, unless an exception for another class of vehicle is approved. Agencies should approve these exceptions on a limited basis and must indicate on the travel authorization the reason for the exception. Your agency may authorize the use of other than a compact car if any of the following apply:</P>
                  <P>(1) When use of other than a compact car is necessary to accommodate a medical disability or other special need.</P>
                  <P>(i) A disability must be certified annually in a written statement by a competent medical authority. However, if the disability is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required. Certification statements must include at a minimum:</P>
                  <P>(A) A written statement by a competent medical authority stating that special accommodation is necessary;</P>
                  <P>(B) An approximate duration of the special accommodation; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) A special need must be certified annually in writing according to your agency's procedures. However, if the special need is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required;</P>
                  <P>(iii) If you are authorized under § 301-13.3(a) to have an attendant accompany you, your agency may authorize the use of other than a compact car if deemed necessary by your agency.</P>
                  <P>(2) When required because of agency mission, consistent with your agency's internal procedures pursuant to § 301-70.102(i).</P>
                  <P>(3) When the cost of other than a compact car is less than or equal to the cost of the least expensive compact car.</P>
                  <P>(4) When additional room is required to accommodate multiple employees authorized to travel together in the same rental vehicle.</P>
                  <P>(5) When travelers must carry a large amount of Government material incident to their official business, and a compact rental vehicle does not contain sufficient space.</P>
                  <P>(6) When necessary for safety reasons, such as during severe weather or having to travel on rough or difficult terrain.</P>
                  <P>(d) Travelers are not to be reimbursed for purchasing pre-paid refueling options for rental cars. Therefore, travelers should refuel prior to returning the rental vehicle to the drop-off location. However, if it is not possible to refuel completely prior to returning the vehicle because of safety issues or the location of closest fueling station, travelers will be reimbursed for vendor refueling charges.</P>
                  <P>(e) Travelers will not be reimbursed for fees associated with rental car loyalty points or the transfer of points charged by car companies.</P>

                <P>Yes, your agency may reimburse you for an advance room deposit, when such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room reservation, prior to the beginning of your scheduled official travel. However, if you are reimbursed the advance room deposit, but fail to perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not acceptable to your agency, resulting in forfeit of the deposit, you are indebted to the Government for that amount and must repay it in a manner prescribed by your agency.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>What is a taxable extended TDY assignment?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>A taxable extended TDY assignment is a TDY assignment that continues for so long that, under the IRC the employee is no longer considered temporarily away from home during any period of employment if such period exceeds 1 year. You are no longer temporarily away from home as of the date that you and/or your agency recognize that your assignment will exceed one year. That is, as soon as you recognize that your assignment will exceed one year, you must notify your agency of that fact, and they must change your status immediately. Similarly, as soon as your agency recognizes that your assignment will exceed one year, your agency must notify you of that fact and change your status. The effective date of this status change is the date on which it was recognized that you are no longer temporarily away from home as defined in the IRC.</P>
                  <P>(a) If you believe that your temporary duty assignment may exceed one year, you should carefully study IRS Publication 463, “Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses,” to determine whether you are or will be considered “temporarily away from home” under this provision. If you are not or will not be considered temporarily away from home under this provision, then you are on taxable extended TDY.</P>
                  <P>(b) The IRC makes an exception for certain Federal personnel involved in investigation or prosecution of a Federal crime during any period for which such employee is certified by the Attorney General (or the designee thereof) as traveling on behalf of the United States in temporary duty status to investigate or prosecute, or provide support services for the investigation or prosecution of, a Federal crime.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>What are the tax consequences of extended TDY?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) If you are on a taxable extended TDY assignment, then all allowances and reimbursements for travel expenses, plus all travel expenses that the Government pays directly on your behalf in connection with your TDY assignment, are taxable income to you. This includes all allowances, reimbursements, and direct payments to vendors from the day that you or your agency recognized that your extended TDY assignment is expected to exceed one year, as explained in § 301-11.601.</P>
                  <P>(b) Your agency will reimburse you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your taxable extended TDY assignment. This reimbursement consists of two parts:</P>
                  <P>(1) The Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA). See Part 302-17, Subpart B of this Subtitle for information on the WTA; and</P>
                  <P>(2) The “Extended TDY Tax Reimbursement Allowance” (ETTRA) (in previous editions of the FTR this was known as the “Income Tax Reimbursement Allowance”).</P>
                  <P>(c) The WTA and ETTRA for taxable extended TDY assignments cover only the TDY benefits described in FTR Chapter 301, Subchapter B. On an extended TDY assignment, you are not eligible for the other benefits that you would have received if your agency had permanently relocated you.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>What are the procedures for calculation and reimbursement of my WTA and ETTRA for taxable extended TDY?+</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) If your agency knows from the beginning of your TDY assignment that your assignment qualifies as taxable extended TDY, then your agency will withhold an amount as a WTA and pay that as withholding tax to the IRS until your extended TDY assignment ends. The WTA itself is taxable income to you, so your agency increases, or “grosses-up,” the amount of the WTA, using a formula to reimburse you for the additional taxes on the WTA.</P>
                  <P>(b) If your agency realizes during a TDY assignment that you will incur taxes (because, for example, the TDY assignment has lasted, or is going to last, longer than originally intended), then your agency will compute the WTA for all taxable benefits received since the date it was recognized that you are no longer “temporarily away from home” (see § 302-11.601 for more information on the meaning of “temporarily away from home”). Your agency will pay that amount to the IRS, and then will begin paying WTA to the IRS until your extended TDY assignment ends.</P>
                  <P>(c) For your ETTRA, your agency will use the same one-year or two-year process that it has chosen to use for the relocation income tax allowance (RITA).</P>
                  <P>(d) See part 302-17 of this subtitle for additional information on the WTA and RITA processes.</P>

                    <P>If your agency offers you the choice, the WTA is optional to you. See §§ 302-17.61 through 302-17.69.</P>

              <P>Yes, if you are an employee of an agency as defined in § 301-1.1 of this chapter, you must use the E-Gov Travel Service when your agency makes it available to you.

              <P>(a) Such use would result in an unreasonable burden on mission accomplishment (e.g., emergency travel is involved and TMS/ETS is not accessible; you are performing invitational travel; or you have special needs or require disability accommodations under part 301-13 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(b) Such use would compromise a national security interest.</P>
              <P>(c) Such use might endanger your life (e.g., you are traveling under the Federal witness protection program, or you are a threatened law enforcement/investigative officer traveling under part 301-31 of this chapter).</P>

                <P>Promotional benefits or materials you receive from a travel service provider in connection with your planning and/or scheduling an official conference or other group travel (as opposed to performing official travel yourself) are considered property of the Government, and you may only accept the benefits or materials on behalf of the Federal Government (<E T="03">see</E> § 301-74.1(d) of this chapter).</P>

              <P>Promotional materials and frequent traveler benefits may be used as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) You may use frequent traveler benefits earned on official travel to obtain travel services for a subsequent official travel assignment(s); however, you may also retain such benefits for your personal use, including upgrading to a higher class of service while on official travel.</P>

              <P>(b) If you are offered such benefits as a result of your role as a conference planner or as a planner for other group travel, you may not retain such benefits for your personal use (<E T="03">see</E> § 301-53.2 of this chapter). Rather, you may only accept such benefits on behalf of the Federal Government. Such accepted benefits may only be used for official Government business.</P>

You may not choose a travel service provider to gain frequent traveler benefits for personal use. (Also see §§ 301-10.109 and 301-10.110 of this chapter.)</P>

                <P>You must:</P>
                <P>(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government;</P>

                <SUBJECT>What factors must we consider in determining which method of transportation results in the greatest advantage to the Government?</SUBJECT>
                <P>In selecting a particular method of transportation you must consider:</P>
                <P>(a) The total cost to the Government, including per diem, overtime, lost worktime, actual transportation cost, total distance of travel, number of points visited, the number of travelers and energy conservation. As stated in 5 U.S.C. 5733, “travel of an employee shall be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.”</P>
                <P>(b) Travel by common carrier (air, rail, bus) is considered the most advantageous method to perform official travel. Other methods of transportation may be authorized as advantageous only when the use of common carrier transportation would interfere with the performance of official business or impose an undue hardship upon the traveler, or when the total cost by common carrier exceeds the cost by another method of transportation. A determination that another method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government than common carrier will not be made on the basis of personal preference or inconvenience to the traveler.</P>
                <P>(c) When travel must be performed by automobile, agencies should next consider using a Government-furnished automobile.</P>
                <P>(d) If a Government-furnished automobile is not available, agencies should then consider using the least expensive compact rental vehicle.</P>
                <P>(e) Agencies should lastly consider authorizing a POV only if the employee agrees to use a POV, because agencies cannot mandate employees to use their POV for official reasons.</P>

                <P>(a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government;</P>
                <P>(b) Who will approve any of the following:</P>

                <P>(1) Use of other than coach-class transportation accommodations for air and rail under §§ 301-10.123 and 301-<PRTPAGE P="80"/>10.162, and lowest first-class accommodations for ship under § 301-10.183 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(e) Procedures for claiming POV reimbursement;</P>

                <P>Yes. When an employee interrupts a TDY assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave of absence for travel to an alternate location to obtain medical services and returns to the TDY assignment, you may reimburse certain excess travel costs provided in this section. Specifically, you may reimburse the excess (if any) of actual costs of travel from the point of interruption to the alternate location and return to the TDY assignment, over the constructive costs of round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate location. The nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating the employee's illness or injury will not, however, be considered an alternate location.

                <P>To reduce travel charge card delinquencies by your employees, you should consider implementing one or more of the following suggestions (this list is not comprehensive; you may adopt other appropriate procedures):</P>

                <P>(a) Agency travel program coordinators must be trained and aware of their responsibilities and the delinquency management tools available under your agreement with the travel charge card contractor (internet training is available for the GSA SmartPay<SU>TM</SU> Travel Charge Card at: <E T="03">http://www.gsa.gov/traveltraining.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Ensure that managers and supervisors are provided monthly delinquency and questionable charges report.</P>
                <P>(c) Periodically, but at least once a year, verify that cardholders are still current employees.</P>
                <P>(d) For inactive accounts (cards not used within 6 months, one year, etc., reduce card limit to $1, increase dollar limit when necessary.</P>
                <P>(e) Work with the charge card contractor to block certain high-risk category codes (e.g., department stores, automobile dealerships, specialty stores), etc.</P>
                <P>(f) Review ATM cash withdrawals for reasonableness and association with official travel.</P>
                <P>(g) Implement a salary offset program. (See part 301-76 of this chapter).</P>
                <P>(h) Implement split disbursement in your travel vouchering system, so that an employee may authorize you to make certain payments directly to the charge card contractor on the employee's behalf.</P>
                <P>(i) Refer potential fraud cases to your agency IG for investigation.</P>

                <P>(j) For some helpful do's and don'ts for travel cardholders, see GSA publication (Card-F001) entitled “Helpful Hints for Travel Cardholders”.

                <P>You may authorize Federal travelers, non-Federal travelers, and any other passengers, as defined in part 300-3 of this subtitle, to travel on Government aircraft, subject to the rules in this subpart. Because the taxpayers generally should pay no more than necessary for transportation of travelers, except for required use travel, you may authorize travel on Government aircraft only when a Government aircraft is the most cost-effective mode of travel and the traveler is traveling for Governmental purposes.</P>

                <P>You may authorize travel on Government aircraft only as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) For official travel when—</P>

                <P>(1) No scheduled commercial airline service is reasonably available to fulfill your agency's travel requirement (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> able to meet the traveler's departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period, unless you demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances require a shorter period); or</P>

                <P>(2) The cost of using a Government aircraft is not more than the cost of the city-pair fare for scheduled commercial airline service or the cost of <PRTPAGE P="87"/>the lowest available full coach fare if a city-pair fare is not available to the traveler.</P>
                <P>(b) For required-use travel, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> when the traveler is authorized to use Government aircraft because of bona fide communications needs (e.g., 24-hour secure communications are required) or security reasons (e.g., highly unusual circumstances that present a clear and present danger to the traveler) or exceptional scheduling requirements (e.g., a national emergency or other compelling operational considerations). Required-use travel may include travel for official, personal, or political purposes, but must be approved in accordance with §§ 301-10.262(a) and 301-70.803(a).</P>
                <P>(c) For space available travel when—</P>
                <P>(1) The aircraft is already scheduled for use for an official purpose and carrying an official traveler(s) on the aircraft does not cause the need for a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government; or</P>
                <P>(2) The Federal traveler or the dependent of a Federal traveler is stationed by the Government in a remote location not accessible to commercial airline service; or</P>
                <P>(3) The traveler is authorized to travel space available under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute.</P>

                <P>(a) Yes, you must ensure that travel on a Government aircraft is the most cost-effective alternative that will meet the travel requirement. Your designated travel approving official must—</P>
                <P>(1) Compare the cost of all travel alternatives, as applicable, that is—</P>
                <P>(i) Travel on a scheduled commercial airline;</P>
                <P>(ii) Travel on a Federal aircraft;</P>
                <P>(iii) Travel on a Government aircraft hired as a commercial aviation service (CAS); and</P>
                <P>(iv) Travel by other available modes of transportation; and</P>
                <P>(2) Approve only the most cost-effective alternative that meets your agency's needs.</P>
                <P>(3) Consider the cost of non-productive or lost work time while in travel status and certain other costs when comparing the costs of using Government aircraft in lieu of scheduled commercial airline service and other available modes of transportation. Additional information on costs included in the cost comparison may be found in the “U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide,” available through the General Services Administration, Office of Governmentwide Policy, MTA, 1800 F Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20405.</P>

                <P>(b) The aircraft management office in the agency that owns or hires the Government aircraft must provide your designated travel-approving official with cost estimates for a Government aircraft trip (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a Federal aircraft trip cost or a CAS aircraft trip cost).</P>
                <P>(c) When an agency operates a Government aircraft to fulfill a non-travel related governmental function or for required use travel, using any space available for passengers on official travel is presumed to result in cost savings.</P>

                <P>You must authorize travel on a Government aircraft as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">For required-use travel.</E> Your agency must first establish written standards for determining the special circumstances under which it will require travelers to use Government aircraft.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">For travel by senior Federal officials.</E> Your agency's senior legal official or his/her principal deputy must authorize all travel on Government aircraft by senior Federal officials on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance and in writing, except for required use travel authorized under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted. Senior Federal officials who are crewmembers or qualified non-crewmembers on a flight in which they are also traveling (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> being transported from point-to-point) are considered travelers and must be authorized to travel on Government aircraft according to this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">For travel by non-Federal travelers.</E> If you are the sponsoring agency for a non-Federal traveler, your senior legal official or his/her deputy must authorize all travel on Government aircraft by that non-Federal traveler on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance and in writing. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">For all other travel.</E> (1) Your agency's designated travel approving official (or anyone to whom he/she delegates this authority and who is at least one organizational level above the traveler) must authorize, in advance and in writing, all other travel on Government aircraft (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by passengers, crewmembers, or qualified non-crewmembers) that is not covered in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's designated travel approving official is permitted. If your agency wishes to issue blanket travel authorizations that authorize travel on Government aircraft, such blanket authorizations must define the circumstances that must be met for using Government aircraft in compliance with this regulation and any additional agency policies. Travel on Government aircraft that does not meet the circumstances specified in the blanket travel authorization must be authorized on a trip-by-trip basis in accordance with this regulation and other applicable agency policies.</P>
                <P>(2) When authorizing space available travel (except as authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute), you must ensure that the aircraft management office in the agency that owns or hires the aircraft has certified in writing before the flight that the aircraft is scheduled to be used for a bona fide governmental function. Bona fide governmental functions may include support for official travel. The aircraft management office must also certify that carrying a traveler(s) in space available does not cause the need for a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government. The aircraft management office must retain this certification for two years. In an emergency situation, prior verbal confirmation of this information with an after-the-fact written certification is permitted.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are our responsibilities for ensuring that Government aircraft are the most cost-effective alternative for travel?</SUBJECT>
                <P>To help ensure that Government aircraft are the most cost-effective alternative for travel, your aircraft management office must calculate the cost of a trip on your aircraft, whether Federal aircraft or CAS aircraft, and submit that information to the traveler's designated travel-approving official upon request. The designated travel-approving official must use that information to compare the cost of using Government aircraft with the cost of scheduled commercial airline service and the cost of using other available modes of transportation. When you operate a Government aircraft to fulfill a non-travel related governmental function or for required use travel, using any space available for passengers on official travel is presumed to result in cost savings. For guidance on how and when to calculate the cost of a trip on Government aircraft, see the “U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide,” published by the Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), General Services Administration, 1800 F Street, N.W., Washington, DC, 20405.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What disclosure information must we give to anyone who flies on our Government aircraft?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must give each person aboard your aircraft a copy of the following disclosure statement:</P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD1">DISCLOSURE FOR PERSONS FLYING ABOARD FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AIRCRAFT</HD>
                  <P>NOTE: The disclosure contained herein is not all-inclusive. You should contact your sponsoring agency for further assistance.</P>
                  <P>Generally, an aircraft used exclusively for the U.S. Government may be considered a 'public aircraft' as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102 and 40125, unless it is transporting passengers or operating for commercial purposes. A public aircraft is not subject to many Federal aviation regulations, including requirements relating to aircraft certification, maintenance, and pilot certification. If a U.S. Government agency transports passengers on a Government aircraft, that agency must comply with all Federal aviation regulations applicable to civil aircraft. If you have questions about the status of a particular flight, you should contact the agency sponsoring the flight.</P>

                  <P>You and your family have certain rights and benefits in the unlikely event you are injured or killed while riding aboard a Government aircraft. Federal employees and some private citizens are eligible for workers' compensation benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). When FECA applies, it is the sole remedy. For more information about FECA and its coverage, consult with your agency's benefits office or contact the Branch of Technical Assistance at the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs at (202) 693-0044. (These rules also apply to travel on <PRTPAGE P="92"/>other Government-owned or operated conveyances such as cars, vans, or buses.)</P>
                  <P>State or foreign laws may provide for product liability or “third party” causes of actions for personal injury or wrongful death. If you have questions about a particular case or believe you have a claim, you should consult with an attorney.</P>
                  <P>Some insurance policies may exclude coverage for injuries or death sustained while traveling aboard a Government or military aircraft or while within a combat area. You may wish to check your policy or consult with your insurance provider before your flight. The insurance available to Federal employees through the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program does not contain an exclusion of this type.</P>
                  <P>If you are the victim of an air disaster resulting from criminal activity, Victim and Witness Specialists from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and/or the local U.S. Attorney's Office will keep you or your family informed about the status of the criminal investigation(s) and provide you or your family with information about rights and services, such as crisis intervention, counseling and emotional support. State crime victim compensation may be able to cover crime-related expenses, such as medical costs, mental health counseling, funeral and burial costs, and lost wages or loss of support. The Office for Victims of Crime (an agency of the Department of Justice) is authorized by the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 to provide emergency financial assistance to state programs, as well as the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the benefit of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">If you are a Federal employee:</E>
                  </P>
                  <P>1. If you are injured or killed on the job during the performance of duty - including while traveling aboard a Government aircraft or other government-owned or operated conveyance for business purposes, you and your family are eligible to collect workers' compensation benefits under FECA. You and your family may not file a personal injury or wrongful death suit against the United States or its employees. However, you may have cause of action against potentially liable third parties.</P>
                  <P>2. You or your qualifying family member must normally also choose between FECA disability or death benefits, and those payable under your retirement system (either the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System). You may choose the benefit that is more favorable to you.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">If you are a private citizen not employed by the Federal Government:</E>
                  </P>
                  <P>1. Even if you are not regularly employed by the Federal Government, if you are rendering personal service to the Federal Government on a voluntary basis or for nominal pay, you may be defined as a Federal employee for purposes of FECA. If that is the case, you and your family are eligible to receive workers' compensation benefits under FECA, but may not collect in a personal injury or wrongful death lawsuit against the United States or its employees. You and your family may file suit against potentially liable third parties. Before you depart, you may wish to consult with the department or agency sponsoring the flight to clarify whether you are considered a Federal employee.</P>
                  <P>2. If there is a determination that you are not a Federal employee, you and your family will not be eligible to receive workman's compensation benefits under FECA. If you are traveling for business purposes, you may be eligible for workman's compensation benefits under state law. If the accident occurs within the United States, or its territories, its airspace, or over the high seas, you and your family may claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act or Suits in Admiralty Act. If you are killed aboard a military aircraft, your family may be eligible to receive compensation under the Military Claims Act, or if you are an inhabitant of a foreign country, under the Foreign Claims Act.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Do the rules in this part apply to travel on Government aircraft by the President and Vice President or by individuals traveling in support of the President and Vice President?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Given the unique functions and needs of the presidency and the vice presidency, section 4 of Circular A-126, “Improving the Management and Use of Government Aircraft,” Revised May 1992, makes clear that Circular A-126 does not apply to aircraft while in use by or in support of the President or Vice President. Since the principal purpose of the rules in this part is to implement Circular A-126, the rules in this part also do not apply to such travel. If any questions arise regarding travel related to the President or Vice President, contact the Office of the Counsel to the President or the Office of the Counsel to the Vice President, respectively.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the policy governing the use of travel advances?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You should minimize the use of cash travel advances. However, you should not require an employee to pay travel expenses using personal funds unless the employee has elected not to use alternative resources provided by the Government, such as a Government contractor-issued charge card.</P>

                <SUBJECT>In situations where a lodging facility requires the payment of a deposit, may we reimburse an employee for an advance room deposit prior to the beginning of scheduled official travel?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Yes, you may reimburse an employee an advance room deposit, when such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room reservation, prior to the beginning of an employee's scheduled official travel. However, if the employee is reimbursed the advance room deposit, but fails to perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not acceptable to the agency, resulting in the forfeit of the deposit, the employee is indebted to the Government and must repay that amount in a timely manner as prescribed by you.</P>

                <P>When planning a conference, you must:</P>
                <P>(a) Minimize all conference costs, including administrative costs, conference attendees' travel costs, and conference attendees' time costs;</P>
                <P>(b) Maximize the use of Government-owned or Government provided conference facilities as much as possible;</P>
                <P>(c) Identify opportunities to reduce costs in selecting a particular conference location and facility (e.g., through the availability of lower rates during the off-season at a site with seasonal rates); and</P>

                <P>(e) Develop and establish internal policies to ensure these standards are met.</P>

                <P>When planning a conference, you should consider all direct and indirect conference costs paid by the Government, whether paid directly by agencies or reimbursed by agencies to travelers or others associated with the conference. Some examples of such costs are:</P>
                <P>(a) Authorized travel and per diem expenses;</P>
                <P>(b) Hire of rooms for official business;</P>

                <P>(a) Assure there is appropriate management oversight of the conference planning process;</P>

                <SUBJECT>What should cost comparisons include?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Cost comparisons should include, but not be limited to, a determination of adequacy of lodging rooms at the established per diem rates, overall convenience of the conference location, fees, availability of meeting space, equipment, and supplies, and commuting or travel distance of attendees.

                <SUBJECT>How should we select a location and a facility?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Site selection is a final decision as to where to hold your conference. The term “site” refers to both the geographical location and the specific facility(ies) selected. In determining the best site in the interest of the Government, you should exercise strict fiscal responsibility to minimize costs. The actions in § 301-74.3 must be followed. Cost comparisons must cover factors such as those listed in § 301-74.4. As part of the cost comparison, you must use the established per diem rate for the locations for which you are comparing costs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What can we do if we cannot find an appropriate conference facility at the chosen locality per diem rate?</SUBJECT>
                <P>While it is always desirable to obtain lodging facilities within the established lodging portion of the per diem rate for the chosen locality, it may not always be possible. In those instances when lodging is not available at the applicable per diem rate, travelers should construct a cost comparison of all associated costs, including round-trip ground transportation, between finding lodging at the applicable per diem rate away from the conference locality and using the actual expense method at the conference locality as prescribed in subpart D of part 301-11 of this chapter.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Chapter 301—Suggested Guidance for Conference Planning</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Terms</HD>
              <P>Conference: A meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium or event that involves attendee travel. The term “conference” also applies to training activities that are considered to be conferences under 5 CFR 410.404.</P>
              <P>Milestone schedule: Deadlines, which need to be reached in a progressive and orderly manner.</P>
              <P>Planner: The person designated to oversee the conference.</P>
              <P>Planning committee: Operational group significantly contributing to a conference's overall success and able to fully reflect the needs of both the agency and the attendees.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Getting Started</HD>
              <P>Depending on the size, type, and intended effect of the conference, start planning a minimum of one year in advance. Designate a planner and a planning committee.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Planning Committee</HD>
              <P>Functions typically include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>• Establishing a set of objectives.</P>
              <P>• Developing a theme.</P>
              <P>• Making recommendations for location, agenda, dates, and logistics, e.g., schedule, exhibits, speaker.</P>
              <P>• Making suggestions as to who should attend.</P>
              <P>• Serving as communications link between planners and participants.</P>
              <P>• Evaluation and follow-up.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Milestone Schedule</HD>
              <P>(a) Develop a milestone schedule, which is essential to conference planning, by working backward from the beginning date of the conference to include each major step. Examples include:</P>
              <P>• Planning committee meetings.</P>
              <P>• Preparation of mailing lists.</P>
              <P>• Letters of invitation.</P>
              <P>• Designation of speakers.</P>
              <P>• Confirmation letters to speakers.</P>
              <P>• Confirmation with site selection official.</P>
              <P>• Preparation of agenda.</P>
              <P>• Preparation of specification sheet.</P>
              <P>• Location and date selection.</P>
              <P>• Exhibits.</P>
              <P>• Budget.</P>
              <P>• Printing requirements.</P>
              <P>• Signage.</P>
              <P>• Conference information packages.</P>
              <P>• Scheduling photographer (if planned).</P>
              <P>• Use of agency seal and conference logo.</P>
              <P>• Handicapped requirements.</P>
              <P>• Planning of meals and refreshments, if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) Establish completion dates for each major step.</P>
              <P>(c) Update and revise the schedule as needed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Specification Sheet</HD>
              <P>A detailed specification sheet is necessary to:</P>
              <P>(a) Identify essential elements of a conference which typically include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>• Sleeping rooms and on-site food services. It is generally best to estimate on the low side for the number of sleeping rooms and meals to be prepared. Facilities, unless there is only limited available space, are usually prepared to increase the number of sleeping rooms and meals; however, they discourage—and in some cases penalize—you if the sleeping room and meal guarantees are not met.</P>
              <P>• Meeting rooms.</P>
              <P>• Exhibit facilities.</P>
              <P>• Audio-visual equipment and support services.</P>
              <P>• Miscellaneous support services.</P>
              <P>• Sleeping rooms with amenities, e.g., Internet access, data ports, conference call, and voice mail.</P>
              <P>(b) Determine costs:</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Procurement.</E> All agreements and decisions should be written and agreed to by the agency-contracting officer before being sent to the facility. Bring contracting officer into the process early.<PRTPAGE P="117"/>
              </P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Government per diem rates.</E> The Government per diem rate applies to Federal attendees. Application of it to non-Federal attendees is at the discretion of the property and conference negotiator.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Registration fee.</E> Generally, the registration fee covers all direct expenditures of agency funds for planning and organization of a conference, e.g., meeting room accommodations, meals, light refreshments (if appropriate), speaker fees, publications, and materials. Anything directly relating to the conference, except liquor, can be included in the fee. To estimate the registration fee, divide the proposed budget by the estimated number of attendees.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Budgeting</HD>

              <P>Decide how the conference expenses (other than sleeping room accommodations and individual meals) will be paid, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> by the attendee from a training or registration fee, or directly by the agency.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conference Site Selection</HD>
              <P>Minimize total costs, all factors considered.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Geographic Location</HD>
              <P>In determining where to locate the conference, consider:</P>
              <P>• Targeted audience.</P>
              <P>• Total costs, including per diem, transportation, and other.</P>
              <P>• Accessibility by car or air.</P>
              <P>• Whether recreational activities are necessary.</P>
              <P>• The expense of desired facility (significant savings can be achieved in off-season periods).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Types of Facilities</HD>
              <P>• <E T="03">Federal Government.</E> Use Government-owned or Government-provided conference facilities to the maximum extent possible.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Convention centers.</E> Excellent for very large meetings, trade shows and exhibits; usually located near a large number of hotels.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Colleges and universities.</E> Many have good meeting facilities and can offer sleeping accommodations when school is not in session.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Hotels.</E> Commercial facilities that may be used to meet all conference needs or just the room night needs.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Conference centers.</E> Dedicated meeting facilities; good for smaller meetings when numerous breakout sessions are planned.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Date Selection</HD>
              <P>For availability and economical reasons, the best months are April, May, September, October, and November. You should book the facility as early as possible to increase the chances of getting the date you want.

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Meals</HD>
              <P>• You can not generally use appropriated funds to pay for meals for employees at their official stations.</P>
              <P>• Employees on TDY travel may be served meals but cannot be reimbursed for those provided at Government expense.</P>
              <P>• You should clarify in advance the appropriate per diem reduction(s) of meal(s) allowance(s) for TDY travel.</P>
              <P>• You may pay, or reimburse an employee for meals as necessary expenses incident to an authorized training program (under the Government Employees Training Act (GETA) at 5 U.S.C. 4104(4)), if a determination has been made that essential training will be conducted during the meal.</P>
              <P>• Work closely with the hotel to plan quality menus that fit within authorized per diem rates.</P>
              <P>• Clarify and agree in advance to the number of meal guarantees.</P>
              <P>• Ensure that gratuities and service charges are added to the cost of each meal, and determine the method of billing to be used (e.g., signed guarantee, collected meal tickets, or actual quantities consumed).</P>
              <P>• Confirm menus.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Breaks and Refreshments</HD>
              <P>Breaks should last no longer than 30 minutes and take place between meeting sessions. The following should also be considered when planning for refreshments:</P>
              <P>• Keep in mind that everyone does not drink coffee or tea.</P>
              <P>• You should clarify and agree in advance that coffee and pastries, if appropriate, are purchased by the gallon and dozen.</P>
              <P>• Try to avoid a per person charge.</P>
              <P>• Negotiate the cost into the contract.</P>
              <P>• Be conservative in your estimates. There are seldom 100 percent of the conference participants attending any one function.</P>
              <P>• If coffee, soft drinks, and water are not included in the fee, are they available “at cost” to the attendee?</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Account Reconciliation</HD>
              <P>It is important to request that the hotel bill be prepared in a logical and chronological sequence, and that backup data accompany the bill. Generally, the hotel will complete its accounting of the conference within two weeks of the conclusion.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notification</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Announcement and/or Invitations</HD>
              <P>Announcement of the planned conference should be made as early as possible, even one year in advance; invitation letters, 8 weeks in advance. They should include, but are not limited to:</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conference Information Package</HD>
              <P>Each registrant should be given a conference information package. Used regularly during the conference, the conference information package should be accurate, beneficial, and reflect detailed information on a daily/hourly basis. If time allows, you may want to finalize the package and send it to the printer at least 4 weeks in advance of the starting date. The program will be widely used, so you may want to print twice as many copies of the program as you have expected attendees. The information package, for example, may contain:</P>
              <P>• A list of everything in the package.</P>
              <P>• A “welcome” letter.</P>
              <P>• A schedule.</P>

                <P>Yes, you may relocate from a place other than from where you are authorized. However, you will be required to pay all additional costs incurred for expenses above your authorized travel and transportation cost.</P>

                <P>Generally no; you may not be reimbursed for relocation expenses if you relocate to a new official station that does not meet the 50-mile distance test.</P>

                <P>(a) The distance test is met when the new official station is at least 50 miles further from the employee's current residence than the old official station is from the same residence. For example, if the old official station is 3 miles from the current residence, then the new official station must be at least 53 miles from that same residence in order to receive relocation expenses for residence transactions. The distance between the official station and residence is the shortest of the commonly traveled routes between them. The distance test does not take into consideration the location of a new residence. This follows the distance guidelines found in <E T="03">Internal Revenue Service Publication 521, Moving Expenses.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(b) The head of your agency or designee may authorize an exception to the 50-mile threshold on a case-by-case <PRTPAGE P="126"/>basis when he/she determines that it is in the best interest of the Government. However, the agency cannot waive the applicability of the IRC; that is, all reimbursed expenses would be taxable income to you, and the agency would have to reimburse those taxes.</P>
                <P>(c) Any relocation must be incidental to the transfer and not for the convenience of the employee.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Cost considerations.</E> You should consider the cost of each alternative. A long-term temporary duty travel assignment requires the payment of either per diem or actual subsistence expenses for the entire period of the assignment. This could be very costly to the agency over an extended period. A TCS will require fairly substantial relocation allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment, and less substantial payments for extended storage and property management services, when authorized, during the period of the assignment. Agencies should estimate the total cost of each alternative and authorize the one that is most advantageous for the agency, cost and other factors considered;</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Tax considerations.</E> An employee who performs a temporary duty travel assignment exceeding one year at a single location is subject to income taxation of his/her travel expense reimbursements. The Withholding Tax Allowance and the Extended TDY Tax Reimbursement Allowance allow for the reimbursement of Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred as a result of taxable extended temporary duty assignments (see §§ 301-11.601—301-11.605 of this Subtitle). An employee who is authorized and performs a TCS also will be subject to income taxation of some, but not all, of his/her TCS expenses. You will pay an offsetting Relocation Income Tax (RIT) allowance on an employee's TCS expense reimbursements; and</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Employee concerns.</E> The long-term assignment of an employee away from his/her official station and immediate family may negatively affect the employee's morale and job performance. Such negative effects may be alleviated by authorizing a TCS so the employee can transport his/her immediate family and/or household goods at Government expense to the location where he/she will perform the long-term assignment. You should consider the effects of a long-term temporary duty travel assignment on an employee when deciding whether to authorize a TCS.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the POV mileage rate for PCS travel?</SUBJECT>

                <P>For approved/authorized PCS travel by POV, the mileage reimbursement rate is the same as the moving expense mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for moving expense deductions. See IRS guidance available on the Internet at <E T="03">www.irs.gov.</E> GSA publishes the rate for mileage reimbursement in an FTR Bulletin on an intermittent basis. You may find the FTR Bulletins at <E T="03">www.gsa.gov/relo.</E>

                <P>(a) You are expected to use the POV on official business at the new official station;</P>
                <P>(b) The common carrier rates for the facilities provided between the old and new official stations, the related constructive taxi or TNC fares, or the cost of utilizing an innovative mobility technology company to and from terminals, and the per diem allowances prescribed under this part justify a higher mileage rate as advantageous to the Government as determined by your agency; or</P>

                <P>The allowance for househunting trip expenses is intended to facilitate and expedite the employee's move from your old official station to your new official station and to lower the Government's overall cost for the employee's relocation by reducing the amount of time an employee must occupy temporary quarters. The allowance for househunting trip expenses provides the employee and/or spouse a period of time to concentrate on finding a suitable permanent residence at the new official station and thereby expedites the employee's relocation.</P>

To take maximum advantage of your trip, however, it is very important that you become familiar as quickly as you can with your new official station area (e.g., housing market conditions, school locations, etc.). If you are selling your residence at your old official station, you should not begin your househunting trip until you have a current appraisal of the value of the residence so that you can more accurately determine the appropriate price range of residences to consider during your househunting trip.</P>

                <P>(a) Your agency will authorize you to travel by any transportation mode(s) (e.g., common carrier or POV) that it determines to be advantageous to the Government. Your agency will pay for your transportation expenses by the authorized mode(s). If you travel by one or more mode(s) other than the one(s) authorized by your agency, your agency will pay your transportation expenses up to the constructive cost of transportation by the authorized mode(s). For trips of less than 250 miles, your agency will authorize travel by POV, unless there are reasons for not using a POV that are acceptable to the agency (e.g., traveler is physically impaired, does not own or lease a POV, has only one POV that is used for family transportation, or the POV is not roadworthy for such a trip). POV mileage reimbursement will be in accordance with § 302-4.300 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(b) Unless the agency performs a written cost comparison that demonstrates cost savings, only common <PRTPAGE P="158"/>carrier may be authorized for trips with a distance of 250 miles or more.</P>

                <P>You must consider the following factors:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Ease of administration.</E> Payment of a per diem allowance under part 302-4 of this chapter requires you to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount, except for meals and incidental expenses. Lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement is easier to administer because you do not have to review expense amounts.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost considerations.</E> You must weigh the cost of each reimbursement option on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Treatment of employees.</E> The employee is allowed to choose between a per diem allowance under part 302-4 of this chapter and lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement when you offer the lump sum reimbursement method. You therefore should weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost considerations in determining which method to offer.</P>

You may, however, interrupt your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement in the following instances:</P>

                <SUBJECT>What am I paid under the TQSE lump sum payment method?</SUBJECT>
                <P>If your agency offers, and you select the lump sum TQSE payment, you are paid a lump sum for each day authorized up to 30 days. The maximum number of days that may be used for the TQSE lump sum calculation is 30; no extensions are allowed under the lump sum payment method.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I determine the amount of my TQSE lump sum payment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For yourself, multiply the number of days your agency authorizes TQSE by .75 times the maximum per diem rate (that is, lodging plus meals and incidental expenses) prescribed by § 301-11.6 of this subtitle for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever TQ will be occupied. Please note that for non-foreign OCONUS, the Department of Defense Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowances Committee establishes the per diem rate, and for foreign OCONUS, the Department of State establishes the per diem rates.</P>
                <P>(b) For each member of your immediate family, multiply the same number of days by .25 times the same per diem rate, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) Your lump sum payment will be the sum of the calculations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

                <P>Yes, if your lump sum TQSE payment is more than adequate to cover your actual TQSE expenses, any balance belongs to you. (E.g., if your agency authorizes and you accept a lump sum payment for 15 days of TQSE and you vacate TQ after 10 days for any reason, you would retain the remaining balance for the 5 days of TQSE not incurred).</P>

                <P>No, you are not required to file a voucher after occupying temporary quarters if you have selected the lump sum payment. The intent of the lump sum payment is to simplify the process and eliminate the need for filing a voucher. However, your agency may require that you sign a voucher or other document before they pay your lump sum TQSE to you, and your agency may at any time request proof that you actually occupied TQ, even if not <PRTPAGE P="165"/>for the full length of time on which the lump sum calculation was based. In the absence of sufficient proof of TQSE occupancy, your agency may demand repayment of the TQSE lump sum payment in accordance with § 302-6.305.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">The existence of less expensive alternatives.</E> If a less expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less overall.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">The existence of other opportunities to arrange for permanent quarters.</E> Consider whether the employee had other adequate opportunity to arrange for permanent quarters.

                <SUBJECT>What factors should we consider in determining whether to offer an employee a lump sum payment option for TQSE?</SUBJECT>
                <P>When determining whether to offer an employee the lump sum payment option for TQSE the following factors should be considered:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Ease of administration.</E> A lump sum for TQSE is paid to the employee prior to the occupancy of TQ, and the after the fact voucher process is eliminated under this method. Actual TQSE reimbursement requires an agency to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost consideration.</E> You should weigh the cost of each alternative. Actual TQSE reimbursement may extend <PRTPAGE P="166"/>up to 120 days, while the lump sum payment is limited to a maximum of 30 days.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Treatment of employee.</E> The employee is allowed to choose between actual TQSE reimbursement and the lump sum TQSE payment when you offer the lump sum payment method. You therefore should weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost considerations in determining which method to offer.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the maximum weight of HHG that may be transported or stored at Government expense?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The maximum weight allowance of HHG that may be shipped or stored at Government expense is 18,000 pounds net weight. For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000 pound allowance is added to the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance to cover packing materials for the shipment. In no case may a shipment weigh over 20,000 gross pounds (the 18,000 pounds net weight of the uncrated HHG plus the 2,000 pound allowance for packing materials). The relocating employee is responsible for reimbursing the Government for all costs incurred if the shipment is overweight. For determining the weight of crated shipments, containerized shipments, and constructive weight for other types of household good shipments, please <E T="03">see</E> the chart in § 302-7.13.</P>
                <P>(b) An agency may establish a lower net weight allowance and a lower allowance for packing materials in special circumstances, such as transferring an employee into government-furnished quarters.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May HHG be transported or stored in more than one lot?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Household goods may be transported and stored in multiple lots, however, your maximum HHG weight allowance is based upon shipping and storing all HHG as one lot.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Who pays for shipping professional books, papers, and equipment (PBP&amp;E)?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The agency may pay for shipping PBP&amp;E as a discretionary item. When authorized, shipping PBP&amp;E is considered an administrative cost to the agency. However, for ease of administration in calculating this allowance, PBP&amp;E should be included as part of the HHG shipment, if possible. That is, if the net weight of the HHG plus the PBP&amp;E is less than 18,000 pounds, the agency should ship the items together and pay for the HHG shipment in one payment.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What happens if the HHG shipment includes PBP&amp;E, and it might exceed, or did exceed, the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Separate the PBP&amp;E and have the HHG carrier estimate the weight of the PBP&amp;E before the HHG shipment is picked up. Subtract 110 percent of the estimated PBP&amp;E weight (to adjust for packing materials) from the estimated gross weight as shown on the shipping documents (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> net weight minus the PBP&amp;E minus 10 percent of the PBP&amp;E). If the result is more than the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance.</P>
                <P>(b) If you did not discover that the HHG shipment exceeded the net weight allowance in advance, and if you did not weigh or estimate the PBP&amp;E before shipping it, then weigh the PBP&amp;E before it is delivered. Determine if the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance by applying the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) If the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment does not exceed the net weight allowance, then the agency may transport and pay for shipping the PBP&amp;E plus packing materials with the household goods.</P>
                <P>(d) However, if the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment may exceed the net weight allowance, and if the employee was authorized PBP&amp;E, then the employee must pay for shipping all weight that exceeds the net weight allowance for their HHG, minus the PBP&amp;E and packing materials for both. The agency may then pay for shipping the PBP&amp;E as an administrative expense.</P>
                <P>(e) The agency may require reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&amp;E and the weight of the PBP&amp;E.</P>

However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe).</P>

This includes, but is not limited to packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, drayage, weighing, pickup/delivery, line-haul, accessorial charges, and temporary storage charges, including but not limited to handling in/out, etc. However, your reimbursement may not fully cover your total out-of-pocket expenses. In determining the distance shipped you may use the tariffs filed with GSA travel management centers or any other mileage guide authorized by your agency. If the exact mileage is not shown, the next higher mileage distance applies. If there is a minimum weight charge above the actual weight under applicable tariffs, reimbursement will be based on the minimum weight charge instead of the actual weight.</P>

                <P>Your agency is responsible for making all the necessary arrangements for transporting HHG, PBP&amp;E, and temporary storage, including but not limited to packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, etc., under the actual expense method. Your agency will issue a Bill of Lading or any other shipping document with all charges billed directly to the agency. Any cost or weight in excess of 18,000 pounds will be at your expense. If the shipment exceeds the maximum weight prescribed in § 302-7.2, the Government will pay the total charges and the employee will reimburse the Government for the cost of transportation and other charges applicable to the excess weight.</P>

                <P>(b) Authorize commuted rate or actual expense for transportation and payment for HHG, PBP&amp;E, and temporary storage;</P>
                <P>(c) Authorize PBP&amp;E to be transported as an agency administrative expense in accordance with FTR guidelines (usually the authorizing official for PBP&amp;E will be at the employee's new official station);</P>

                <P>(g) Ensure that international HHG shipments by water are made on ships registered under the laws of the United States whenever such ships are available (<E T="03">see</E> The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (10 U.S.C. 2631) and The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (46 U.S.C. 55302));</P>

                <SUBJECT>What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment and temporary storage of HHG?</SUBJECT>
                <P>There are two methods of arranging and paying for shipment of HHG and providing for temporary storage: actual expense and commuted rate. You must authorize actual expense or commuted rate, depending on which is less costly to the Government. You must then specify the selected method on the relocation travel authorization.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Actual expense method.</E> Under the actual expense method, the Government assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for the actual expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&amp;E, if <PRTPAGE P="176"/>any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used for all shipments to/from/between OCONUS, and within CONUS where deemed economical to the Government.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Commuted rate system.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Under the commuted rate system, the employee assumes total responsibility for arranging and paying for the expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&amp;E, if any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used only for shipments within CONUS, and only where it is less costly to the Government than actual expense. The employee may arrange for shipment with a commercial HHG carrier or may rent self-drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move.</P>
                <P>(2) The commuted rate is calculated based on published HHG tariffs applied to the actual weight of the goods being shipped (subject also to the weight limitation in §§ 302-7.2 through 302-7.5).</P>

                <P>(3) If a PBP&amp;E shipment causes the weight of a shipment under the commuted rate method to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, then the actual cost of shipping that excess weight attributed to the PBP&amp;E may be paid as an administrative expense of the agency. In this case, all related transportation arrangements (e.g., packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) associated with shipping this excess weight will be handled and paid for by the agency (<E T="03">see</E> § 302-7.5 for the process of determining what will paid for by the agency).</P>

                <SUBJECT>What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment of PBP&amp;E and UAB?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You should authorize the actual expense method for shipping an employee's PBP&amp;E only when the weight of the PBP&amp;E causes the employee's shipment to exceed the maximum 18,000 pounds net HHG weight limitation and in accordance with § 302-7.403. Preferably, PBP&amp;E should be identified and weighed prior to shipment, so the weight can easily be deducted from the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance. In cases where the weight of the PBP&amp;E causes the shipment to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, the PBP&amp;E shipment may be paid for as an administrative expense by you, provided you authorized PBP&amp;E.</P>
                <P>(b) You should authorize the actual expense method for shipping an employee's UAB. UAB should be identified, weighed, and shipped prior to shipment of HHG. In cases where the weight of the UAB causes the shipment to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, the cost of the excess weight is the responsibility of the employee. Under the actual expense method of shipment, you are responsible for paying the bill of lading in full and then collecting any excess cost from the employee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What guidelines must we follow when authorizing transportation of PBP&amp;E as an administrative expense?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You have the sole discretion to authorize transportation of PBP&amp;E as an administrative expense and may do so provided that:</P>
                <P>(a) The authorizing official has certified that the PBP&amp;E is necessary for performance of the employee's duties at the new duty station;</P>
                <P>(b) The authorizing official has certified that, if these items were not transported, the same or similar items would have to be obtained at Government expense for the employee's use at the new official station;</P>
                <P>(c) You have acquired evidence that transporting the PBP&amp;E would cause the employees' HHG to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance; and</P>
                <P>(d) If you have requested it, the employee has provided reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&amp;E and the weight of the PBP&amp;E for review by the authorizing official (who is usually an official at the employee's new official station).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Are separate weight certificates required when HHG are shipped under the actual expense method and PBP&amp;E are shipped as an administrative expense in the same lot?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Yes, separate weight certificates are required when the PBP&amp;E and its packing allowance pushes the shipment over the net weight allowance. Otherwise, for administrative efficiency, the HHG shipment should be billed and paid for as a single shipment. If separate weight certificates are required, then the weight of PBP&amp;E and the administrative appropriation chargeable must be listed as separate items on the bill of lading or other shipping document.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How must we arrange and pay for transportation of HHG and UAB, if we have authorized actual expense for transportation?</SUBJECT>
                <P>When arranging transportation of HHG and UAB under the actual expense method, you should:</P>
                <P>(a) Determine the constructive cost of transporting the HHG plus the UAB, as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Compute the cost of transporting the HHG (not including the UAB) in one lot, by the most economical means; be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.</P>
                <P>(2) Compute the cost of transporting the UAB.</P>
                <P>(3) If the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then compute the cost of transporting only the net weight allowance as one shipment; again, be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.</P>
                <P>(4) The constructive cost is either that described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, depending on whether the weight of the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the net weight allowance.</P>
                <P>(b) Limit the employee's HHG plus UAB transportation payment to the constructive cost as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, so long as it is equal to or less than the 18,000 pound net limit of this Chapter;</P>
                <P>(c) Make arrangements for transporting the employee's HHG and UAB under two separate bills of lading, with direct payment by the agency for both; and</P>
                <P>(d) Advise employees of this relocation entitlement limitation and its potential to result in out-of-pocket expenses to the employee. That is, advise employees that they will have to use their personal funds to pay for transporting HHG (including UAB) in excess of 18,000 pounds net weight allowance.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the policy for extended storage of HHG during assignment to isolated locations in CONUS?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Extended storage of HHG belonging to an employee transferred or a new appointee assigned to an official station at an isolated location in CONUS may be allowed only when it is clearly justified under the conditions in this part and is not primarily for the convenience, or at the request of, the employee or the new appointee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the criteria for determining whether an official station is an isolated official station for purposes of this part?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) As determined by your agency, an official station at an isolated location is a place of permanent duty assignment in CONUS at which you have no alternative except to live where you are unable to use your HHG because:</P>
                <P>(1) The type of quarters you are required to occupy at the isolated official station will not accommodate your HHG; or</P>
                <P>(2) Residence quarters which would accommodate your HHG are not available within reasonable daily commuting distance of the official station.</P>

                <P>(b) The designation of an official station as isolated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude a determination in individual instances that adequate housing is available for some employees stationed there based on housing which may be available within daily commuting distance and the size and other characteristics of each employee's immediate family. In such instances the station shall not be considered isolated with regard to you if your agency determines adequate family housing is available for you.

                <P>(a) Your agency will conduct periodic reviews to determine whether current housing conditions at your isolated official station warrant continuation of storage;</P>
                <P>(b) Eligibility for extended storage at Government expense will terminate on your last day of active duty at the isolated official station. However your HHG may remain in temporary storage for an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days, if approved by your agency.</P>
                <P>(c) When eligibility ceases, storage at Government expense may continue until the beginning of the second month after the month in which your tour at the official station OCONUS terminates, unless to avoid inequity your agency extends the period.</P>

                  <P>If there is no port or terminal at the point of origin and/or destination, your agency will pay the entire cost of transporting the POV from your point of origin to your destination. If you prefer, however, you may choose to drive your POV from your point of origin at time of assignment to the nearest embarkation port or terminal, and/or from the debarkation port or terminal nearest your destination to your post of duty at any time. If you choose to drive, you will be reimbursed your one-way mileage cost, at the rate specified in part 301-4 of this title, for driving the POV from your authorized origin to deliver it to the port of embarkation, or from the port of debarkation to the authorized destination. For the segment of travel from the port of embarkation back to your authorized origin after delivering the POV to the port or from your authorized destination to the port of debarkation to pick up the POV, you will be reimbursed your one-way transportation cost. The total cost of round-trip travel, to deliver the POV to the port at the origin or to pick up the POV at the port at your destination, may not exceed the cost of transporting the POV to or from the port involved. You may not be reimbursed a per diem allowance for round-trip travel to and from the port involved.</P>

                <P>Yes, you are required to participate in homesale counseling if you are going to use the RSC. The RSC and/or your agency must provide counseling to help you understand the process, select a broker, prepare your home for sale, identify an appropriate selling price, set realistic expectations, etc. This counseling may be in person or via an electronic medium, at your agency's discretion. Your agency should also provide you with relocation information/counseling prior to you making any decisions to relocate.</P>

                <P>You must consider the following factors in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Risk of alternative methods.</E> Under a fixed fee contract, the relocation services company bears all risks not expressly contained in the contract. Under a cost-reimbursable contract, you must assume some or all risks and, therefore, must assume some management responsibilities under the contract as well. For example, under a fixed fee homesale program you are not directly liable for losses incurred if a residence does not sell immediately, while under a cost-reimbursable homesale program you assume some or all risks of selling the residence.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost of alternative methods.</E> Under the fixed fee method of contracting, the fee includes a cost component for <PRTPAGE P="211"/>risks assumed by the relocation services company. Under the cost-reimbursable method of contracting, you are directly responsible for some or all of the costs associated with management of the contract. In deciding whether to use cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, must consider the cost of resources you would require (including personnel costs) to manage a cost-reimbursable relocation services contract.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect on the obligation of funds.</E> You must obligate funds for a relocation in the fiscal year in which the purchase order is awarded under the contract. Under the fixed fee contracting method, the amount of the relocation services fee is fixed and you have a basis for determining the amount of funds to obligate. Under the cost-reimbursable contracting method, you must obligate funds based on an estimate of the costs that will be incurred. When opting for cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, should establish a reliable method of computing fund obligation estimates.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is a “homesale program'?</SUBJECT>
                <P>A “homesale program” is a program offered by an agency through a contractual arrangement with a relocation services company. The relocation services company purchases a transferred employee's residence at fair market (appraised) value and then independently markets and sells the residence.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of a home marketing incentive payment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment is to reduce the Government's relocation costs by encouraging transferred employees to participate in their employing agency's homesale program to independently and aggressively market, and find a bona fide buyer for their residence. This significantly reduces the fees/expenses their agencies must pay to relocation services companies and effectively lowers the cost of such programs.</P>

                <P>(a) Five percent of the price the relocation services company paid when it purchased the residence from you; or<PRTPAGE P="213"/>
                </P>

                <SUBJECT>Are there tax consequences when I receive a home marketing incentive payment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Yes, the home marketing incentive payment is considered income. Consequently, you will be taxed, and your agency will withhold income and employment taxes, on the home marketing incentive payment. You will not, however, receive a withholding tax allowance (WTA) to offset the withholding on your home marketing incentive payment, nor will you receive a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance payment for substantially all of your Federal, state and local income taxes on the incentive payment.</P>

                <P>(a) Whether the program will increase the percentage of residences sold for which employees find a bona fide buyer. You should establish a benchmark for the percentage of residences for which you expect employees to find a bona fide buyer resulting in lower homesale costs to you.

                <P>“Property management services” are programs provided by private companies for a fee, which help an employee to manage his/her residence at the old official station as a rental property. These services typically include, but are not limited to, obtaining a tenant, negotiating the lease, inspecting the property regularly, managing repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms, collecting the rent, paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses from rental proceeds and/or funds of the employee, and accounting for the transactions and providing periodic reports to the employee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What special terms apply to this part?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following definitions apply to this part:</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Allowance</E> means<E T="03">:</E>
                </P>

                <P>(1) Money paid to the employee to cover future expenses, such as the miscellaneous expense <E T="03">allowance</E> (see part 302-16 of this chapter for information about the miscellaneous expense <E T="03">allowance</E>);</P>

                <P>(2) Money paid to the employee to cover past expenses, such as the relocation income tax <E T="03">allowance</E> (RITA) under the two-year tax process described in part 302-17, subpart G; or</P>

                <P>(3) A limit established by statute or regulation, such as the 18,000 pound net weight <E T="03">allowance</E> for household goods shipments (see part 302-7 of this chapter for information about the 18,000 pound net weight <E T="03">allowance</E>).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">City</E> means any unit of general local government as defined in 31 CFR 215.2(b).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Combined marginal tax rate (CMTR)</E> means a single rate determined by combining the applicable marginal tax rates for Federal, state, and local income taxes, using the formula provided in § 302-17.40. (If you incur liability for income tax in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, see § 302-17.44.)</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">County</E> means any unit of local general government as defined in 31 CFR 215.2(e).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Gross-up</E> used as a noun in this part means:</P>
                <P>(1) The process that your agency uses to estimate the additional income tax liability that you incur as a result of relocation benefits and taxes on those benefits; or</P>
                <P>(2) The result of the <E T="03">gross-up</E> process.</P>
                <NOTE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                  <P>The <E T="03">gross-up</E> allows for the fact that every reimbursement of taxes is itself taxable. Therefore, the gross-up calculates the amount an agency must reimburse an employee to cover substantially all of the income taxes incurred as the result of a relocation.</P>
                </NOTE>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Internal Revenue Code (IRC)</E> means Title 26 of the United States Code, which governs Federal income taxes.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Local income tax</E> means a tax imposed by a recognized city or county tax authority that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a <E T="03">local income <PRTPAGE P="222"/>tax</E> under the IRC, at 26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3). (See the definitions for the terms <E T="03">city</E> and <E T="03">county</E> in this section.)</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Marginal tax rate (MTR)</E> means the tax rate that applies to the last increment of taxable income after taxable relocation benefits have been added to the employee's income. For example, suppose a married employee who files jointly has a taxable income of $120,000. According to the IRS 2011 Tax Rate Schedules, taxable income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at the 25 percent tax rate; therefore, the $120,000 taxable income of the employee and spouse is in this range, so they have a 25 percent <E T="03">MTR.</E> If the employee receives $30,000 of taxable relocation benefits, the taxable income for the employee and spouse is now $150,000, which is in the next highest tax bracket. In this example, the employee and spouse now have a Federal <E T="03">MTR</E> of 28 percent once the taxable relocation benefits have been added to their income.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Reimbursement</E> means money paid to you to cover expenses that you have already paid for out of your own funds.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Relocation benefits</E> means all reimbursements and allowances that you receive, plus all direct payments that your agency makes on your behalf, in connection with your relocation.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Relocation income tax allowance (RITA)</E> means the payment to the employee to cover the difference between the withholding tax allowance (WTA), if any, and the actual tax liability incurred by the employee as a result of their taxable relocation benefits; <E T="03">RITA</E> is paid whenever the actual tax liability exceeds the WTA.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">State</E> means any one of the several states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">State income tax</E> means a tax imposed by a state tax authority that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes under the IRC, specifically 26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Withholding tax allowance (WTA)</E> means the amount paid to the Federal IRS by the agency as withholding of income taxes for any taxable relocation allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 302-17.2</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Why does relocation affect personal income taxes?</SUBJECT>
                <P>When you are relocated from one permanent duty station to another, you are reimbursed by your employing agency for certain expenses. The IRC requires that you report many of these relocation benefits, including some that your agency pays on your behalf, as taxable income. When you receive taxable benefits, you must pay income tax on the amount or value of those benefits. However, 5 U.S.C. 5724b also requires that your agency reimburse you for substantially all of the additional Federal, state, and local income taxes you incur as a result of any taxable relocation benefits. A reimbursement for taxes is also a taxable benefit on which you must pay additional taxes.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 302-17.3</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>What is the Government's objective in reimbursing the additional income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Government's objective is to reimburse transferred employees for substantially all (not exactly all—see § 302-17.4) of the additional Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation, including the taxes on the taxable relocation benefits and the taxes on the reimbursement for taxes.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 302-17.4</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Why is the reimbursement for substantially all, and not exactly all, of the additional income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Because of the complexity of the calculations, which involve not only Federal income tax but also the income tax rates of many states and localities, it is not reasonable for the Government to compute the exact impact of relocation on an affected employee's taxes. Making a good faith effort to reimburse substantially all additional income taxes is sufficient. The statute where this appears, at 5 U.S.C. 5724b does not define substantially all. This Part provides the description through its provisions.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Who is eligible for the WTA and the RITA?</SUBJECT>

                <P>The withholding tax allowance (WTA) and the relocation income tax allowance (RITA) are the two allowances through which the Government reimburses you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation. You are eligible for the WTA and the RITA if your agency is transferring you from one permanent duty station to another, in the interest of the Government, and your agency's reimbursements to you for relocation expenses result in you being liable for additional taxes.

                  <P>If your agency offers you the choice, the WTA is optional to you. See 302-17.61 through 302-17.69.</P>

                <P>You are not eligible for the WTA or the RITA if you are:</P>
                <P>(a) A new appointee;</P>

                <SUBJECT>Is there any circumstance under which the WTA and the RITA are not paid even though I would otherwise be eligible?</SUBJECT>
                <P>If you violate the 12-month service agreement under which you are relocated, your agency will not pay the WTA or the RITA to you, and you must repay any relocation benefits paid prior to the violation.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 302-17.8</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>What limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to various relocation reimbursements?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If you were moving yourself for a new job, with no help from your employer, then you probably would be able to deduct some of your relocation expenses. However, if you are eligible for WTA and RITA under this part, your Federal agency reimburses you or pays directly for many relocation expenses that otherwise would be deductible. Since you could have deducted these expenses if you had paid them yourself, the benefits you receive from your agency for these “deductible” relocation expenses are nontaxable. Therefore, you do not report them as income and you cannot take them as deductions.</P>
                <P>(b) However, many other relocation benefits are taxable income to you, the employee, because you could not have deducted them. You also may not deduct the additional taxes you incur, as a result of taxable benefits (except that you may deduct state and local income taxes on your Federal tax return). Your agency will reimburse you for most of these taxable expenses and for substantially all of the additional taxes that you incur as a result of the taxable benefits.</P>
                <P>(c) The following table summarizes the FTR allowances, limitations, and tax treatment of each reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor. See IRS Publication 521, Moving Expenses, and the cited FTR paragraphs for details.</P>

                <P>Both you and your agency must know which reimbursements and direct payments to vendors are taxable and which are nontaxable in your specific circumstances. When you submit a voucher for reimbursement, your agency must determine whether the reimbursement is taxable income at the Federal, state, and/or local level. Then, when you file your income tax returns, you must report the taxable allowances, reimbursements, and direct payments to vendors as income. Your agency is ultimately responsible for calculating and reporting withholding accurately and you are ultimately responsible for filing your taxes correctly.</P>

                <P>In most cases, your state tax return for the state you are leaving should reflect your reimbursement or allowance, if any, for househunting expenses and your reimbursement or direct payments to vendors for real estate expenses at the home you are leaving. All other taxable expenses should be shown as income on the tax return you file in the state into which you have moved. However, you and your agency must carefully study the rules in both states and include everything that each state considers to be income on each of your state tax returns.</P>

                <P>(a) Taxes on extended TDY benefits are computed using exactly the same processes described in this Part for the WTA and RITA except that:</P>
                <P>(1) The tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “withholding tax allowance” (WTA) in exactly the same fashion as the process for taxes on relocation allowances; however, in place of the term “relocation income tax allowance,” the tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “extended TDY tax reimbursement allowance” (ETTRA); and</P>
                <P>(2) All benefits are taxable under extended TDY, so the sections of this Part that discuss which benefits are taxable and which are not have no relevance to ETTRA.</P>

                <P>The purpose of the WTA is to protect you from having to use part of your relocation expense reimbursements to pay Federal income tax withholding; it does not cover state taxes, local taxes, Medicare taxes, or Social Security taxes (see § 302-17.22(c) and (d)).

                <P>The WTA covers certain allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to vendors, to the extent that each of them is taxable income. It does not cover any allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor <PRTPAGE P="226"/>that is nontaxable; that is, your agency will not give you a WTA for anything that is not considered taxable income to you (see Table 1 in § 302-17.8 for a summary of tax treatment). In particular, the WTA covers:</P>
                <P>(a) En route meals and incidental expenses—Reimbursements for meals and incidental expenses while en route are taxable and, therefore, are covered by the WTA.</P>
                <P>(b) One Househunting trip—Travel (including per diem and transportation) expenses for you (and your spouse) for one round trip to the new official station to seek permanent residence quarters. Househunting is covered regardless of whether it is reimbursed under the actual expense or lump sum method. (See part 302-5 of this chapter.)</P>
                <P>(c) Temporary quarters—Subsistence expenses for you and your immediate family during occupancy of temporary quarters. Temporary quarters are covered regardless of whether it is reimbursed under the actual expense or lump sum method. (See part 302-6 of this chapter.)</P>
                <P>(d) Extended storage expenses—Extended storage for a temporary change of station in CONUS or assignment to an isolated duty station in CONUS, but only if these expenses are allowed by part 302-8 of this chapter and your agency's policy.</P>
                <P>(e) Real estate expenses—Expenses for the sale of the residence at your old official station and purchase of a home at your new official station. This can also include expenses for settling an unexpired lease (“breaking” a lease) at your old official station. (See part 302-11 of this chapter. If you do not hold full title to the home you are selling or buying, see § 302-11.7 of this chapter.)</P>
                <P>(f) Expenses paid by a relocation company to the extent such payments constitute taxable income to the employee. The extent to which such payments constitute taxable income varies according to the individual circumstances of your relocation, and by the state and locality in which you reside. (See IRS Publication 521, Moving Expenses, and appropriate state and local tax authorities for additional information.)</P>
                <P>(g) Property Management Services—Payment for the services of a property manager for renting rather than selling a residence at your old official station. (See part 302-15 of this chapter.)</P>

                <SUBJECT>What relocation expenses does the WTA not cover?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The WTA does not cover the following relocation expenses:</P>
                <P>(a) Any reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor that should not be reported as taxable income when you file your Federal tax return; this includes but is not limited to en route lodging and transportation, HHG transportation, and transportation of POVs.</P>
                <P>(b) Reimbursed expenses for extended storage of household goods during an OCONUS assignment, if reimbursement is permitted under your agency's policy.</P>
                <P>(c) State and local withholding tax obligations. To the extent that your state or local tax authority requires periodic (such as quarterly) tax payments, you are responsible to pay these from your own funds. Your agency reimburses you for substantially all of these payments through the RITA process, but your agency does not provide a WTA for them. If required to by state or local law, your agency may withhold these from your reimbursement.</P>
                <P>(d) Additional taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act including Social Security tax, if applicable, and Medicare tax. Current law does not allow Federal agencies to reimburse transferees for these employment taxes on relocation benefits. However, your agency will deduct for these taxes from your reimbursements for taxable items.</P>

                <P>(e) Any reimbursement amount that exceeds the actual expense paid or incurred. For example, if your reimbursement for the movement of household goods is based on the commuted rate schedule but your actual relocation expenses are less than that, your tax liability for the difference is not covered by the WTA or RITA.<PRTPAGE P="227"/>
                </P>
                <P>(f) Home marketing incentive payment. In accordance with FTR part 302-14, your agency may not provide you either a WTA or RITA for this incentive.</P>
                <P>(g) Any recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive payment that you receive. Any withholding of taxes for such payments is outside the scope of this regulation. Rather, it is covered by regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management, Treasury's Financial Management Service, and the IRS.</P>
                <P>(h) Any allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to vendors not related to your relocation; for example, a reimbursement for office supplies would not be covered by the WTA, even if it occurred during your relocation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the procedures for my WTA?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Your agency prepares a relocation travel authorization, which includes an estimate of the WTA and RITA, to obligate funds for your relocation.</P>
                <P>(b) Your agency pays certain allowances to you. Your agency also pays vendors directly for other relocation expenses.</P>
                <P>(c) Your agency instructs you as to whether to submit one voucher after you have completed your relocation or to submit vouchers at various points as your relocation progresses plus another when your relocation is completed.</P>
                <P>(d) You submit your voucher(s) for reimbursement of certain relocation expenses.</P>
                <P>(e) Your agency determines the extent to which each allowance, each item on your voucher(s), and each direct payment to a vendor is nontaxable or is taxable income to you under the IRC.</P>
                <P>(f) For the taxable items, your agency calculates your WTA and any reimbursement(s) due to you in accordance with § 302-17.24. Your agency sets aside the amount of your WTA and pays the IRS as a withholding tax in accordance with IRS requirements.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does my agency compute my WTA?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Your agency computes your WTA by applying the grossed-up withholding formula below each time your agency incurs a covered, taxable relocation expense, regardless of whether it is a reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor.</P>

                <P>(b) The law currently provides for a withholding rate of 25 percent for “supplemental wages” that are identified separately from regular wages (This rate has not always been 25 percent and may change in the future; GSA will revise the FTR to reflect any changes as quickly as possible, but users of this part should see IRS Publication 15, Employer's Tax Guide, for the most current rate). Taxable payments for relocation expenses are “supplemental wages,” as defined in IRS Publication 15. However, you owe taxes on the WTA itself because, like most other relocation allowances, it is taxable income. To reimburse you for the taxes on the WTA itself, your agency computes the WTA by multiplying the reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor by 0.3333 instead of 0.25. That is:

                <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of the RITA?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The purpose of the RITA is to reimburse you for any taxes that you owe that were not adequately reimbursed by the WTA. As discussed in § 302-17.24, the WTA calculation is based on the 25 percent income tax withholding rate applicable to supplemental wages. This <PRTPAGE P="228"/>may be higher or lower than your actual tax rate. The RITA, on the other hand, is based on your marginal tax rate, determined by your actual taxable income and filing status, which allows your agency to reimburse you for <E T="03">substantially all</E> of your Federal income taxes. The RITA also reimburses you for any additional state and local taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation, because they are not reimbursed in the WTA process.</P>
                <P>(b) The WTA may be optional to you. See § 302-17.61 for a discussion of criteria for choosing whether or not to accept the WTA. See §§ 302-17.62 through 302-17.69 for procedures if you choose not to accept the WTA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May I ask my agency to recalculate my RITA?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Yes, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA provided you filed your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” and amended it, if necessary, in a timely manner. If, once you have completed all Federal, state, and local tax returns, you believe that your RITA should have been significantly different from the RITA that your agency calculated, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA. This is true for either the one-year or two-year process. With any request for recalculation, you must submit a statement explaining why you believe your RITA was incorrect.</P>

                <P>(b) Please note that your agency may require that you also submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” (if, for example, you inadvertently did not report some of your income in your original Statement), your actual tax returns, or both, as attachments to your request for recalculation.

                <SUBJECT>How does my agency calculate my CMTR?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The CMTR is a key element that greatly enhances the accuracy of the calculation of your RITA. Your agency uses the information on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” as amended, to determine your CMTR, as follows (see subparts F and G of this part for information about the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”).</P>
                <P>(b) The CMTR is, in essence, a combination of your Federal, state, and local tax rates. However, the CMTR cannot be calculated by merely adding the Federal, state, and local marginal tax rates together because of the deductibility of state and local income taxes from income on your Federal income tax return. The formula prescribed below for calculating the CMTR, therefore, is designed to adjust the state and local tax rates to compensate for their deductibility from income for Federal tax purposes.</P>
                <P>(c) The formula for calculating the CMTR is:

                <P>(d) Your agency finds the Federal marginal tax rate by comparing your taxable income, as shown in your “Statement of Income and Filing Status,” to the Federal tax tables in the current year's Form 1040-ES instructions (see §§ 302-17.50—302-17.53 and §§ 302-17.63—302-17.65 for additional information on the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”).</P>
                <P>(e) Your agency finds the state and local marginal tax rates that apply to you (if any) by comparing your taxable income to the most current state and/or local tax tables provided by the states and localities. Every Federal payroll office and every provider of tax calculation software has these tables readily available, and the tables are also available on the Web sites of the various state and local taxing authorities.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What local marginal tax rate(s) does my agency use?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If you incur local tax liability, you provide the applicable marginal tax rate(s) on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”. Your agency validates the applicable local marginal tax rate(s) and uses it (them) in the CMTR formula.</P>
                <P>(b) If you incur local income tax liability in more than one locality, then your agency should follow the rules described for state income taxes in § 302-17.42 to calculate the local marginal tax rate that will be used in the CMTR formula and to compute your RITA, and you should follow the rules in § 302-17.42 to determine your actions.</P>
                <P>(c) If a locality in which you incur income tax liability publishes its tax rates in terms of a percentage of your Federal or state taxes, then your agency must convert that tax rate to a percentage of your income to use it in computing your CMTR. This is accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal or state tax rate by the applicable local tax rate. For example, if the state marginal tax rate is 6 percent and the local tax rate is 50 percent of state income tax liability, the local marginal tax rate stated as a percentage of taxable income would be 3 percent.</P>

                <P>(b) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is <E T="03">higher</E> than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, and if all of the states involved either have no income tax or <E T="03">allow</E> an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the rate for Puerto Rico in place of the Federal marginal tax rate in the formula in § 302-17.40(c).<PRTPAGE P="231"/>

                <P>If you don't file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” and/or amend it when necessary, your agency will switch to the 2-year process, and because the WTA is an advance of your income tax expenses, you will be liable to repay the full amount of the WTA that your agency has paid to the IRS.

                <SUBJECT>How does my agency calculate my RITA under the one-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Your agency provides allowances to you, reimburses you for vouchers that you submit, and pays certain relocation vendors directly, all during the calendar year as described in subpart B of this part. Some of these reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable income to you, the employee, as described in subpart A of this part. Your agency computes a WTA and reports the WTA to the IRS as taxes withheld for you for each of these taxable reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors. The WTA may be optional to you. However, if your agency is using a one-year RITA process, there is no advantage to you in choosing not to receive the WTA, because your agency will adjust the WTA payment to the IRS. See § 302-17.55(a)(1).</P>
                <P>(b) Your agency establishes a cutoff date (for example, December 1), after which it will not issue reimbursements or allowances to you or make direct payments to relocation vendors for the rest of the calendar year.</P>
                <P>(c) If the information on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” changes after you have submitted the initial version, you must submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” no later than your agency's cutoff date.</P>
                <P>(d) During the period between the cutoff date and the end of the calendar year, your agency calculates your RITA.</P>
                <P>(e) Your RITA is itself taxable income to you. To account for taxes on the RITA, your agency will gross-up your RITA by using a gross-up formula that multiplies the grossed-up CMTR by the total of all covered taxable relocation benefits, and then subtracts your grossed-up WTA from that total. That is:</P>

                <SUBJECT>What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA under the one-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA computed and reported during the year, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:</P>
                <P>(1) If the calculation above results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as WTA), then your agency will send an adjustment to the IRS using Form 941. In this case, your agency does not make a RITA payment to you because you do not need additional funds to pay your taxes. That is, everything you need to pay substantially all of your taxes was included in the adjusted WTA, and that is the amount that will appear on your Form W-2.</P>
                <P>(2) If the calculation above results in a positive value (that is if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money for your income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of the calendar year and report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year.</P>

                <P>(b) Shortly after the end of the calendar year, your agency will provide one or two W-2 Forms to you. At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W-2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA (if any), along with your payroll wages, or you may receive one W-2 for <PRTPAGE P="234"/>your payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What do I do, under the one-year process, once my agency has provided my W-2(s)?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You must use all W-2(s) that you have received to file your tax returns. On those returns, you must include all taxable relocation expenses shown on your W-2(s) as income, including your WTA and RITA (if any). Please note that you must also include all WTA as withholding, in addition to the standard withholding from your payroll wages.</P>
                <P>(b) If you finished your relocation within one calendar year, and your agency paid all of your relocation reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors in the same calendar year, before the cutoff date, then your tax returns for that calendar year are the end of your relocation tax process. If, on the other hand, your agency reimburses you for relocation expenses, or pays allowances or relocation vendors on your behalf, during a second (and possibly a third) calendar year, then you and your agency repeat the process above for each of those years.</P>

                <P>(a) Year 1 is the calendar year in which the agency reimburses you for a specific expense, provides an allowance, or pays a vendor directly. If your reimbursements, allowances, and/or direct payments to vendors occur in more than one calendar year, you will have more than one Year 1.</P>
                <P>(b) Year 2 is the calendar year in which you submit your RITA claim and your agency pays your RITA to you.</P>
                <P>(c) In most cases:</P>
                <P>(1) For every Year 1 you will have a corresponding Year 2;</P>
                <P>(2) Every Year 2 immediately follows a Year 1; and</P>
                <P>(3) Year 2 is the year in which you file a tax return reflecting your remaining tax liability for taxable reimbursement(s), allowance(s), and/or direct payments to vendors in each Year 1.</P>
                <P>(d) The table below offers a graphic explanation of Year 1 and Year 2, assuming that you begin your relocation in 2012 and incurred additional approved expenses in 2013.</P>

                <P>(b) WTA is paid at a rate of 25 percent. When deciding whether or not to receive the WTA, you should consider the following:</P>

                <P>(1) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be 25 percent or higher for the calendar year for which you received the majority of your relocation reimbursements, you may want to elect to receive the WTA, because your initial reimbursements will be higher, as shown in the following Example 3 to part 302-17).

                <SUBJECT>When should I file my “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” and RITA claim under the two-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>For the two-year process, you should file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in Year 2, along with your RITA claim, after you file your income tax return. If your agency pays any taxable expenses covered by the WTA (if any) in more than one year, then you will have to file a new “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” each year. Your agency establishes the deadline each year for filing of your Statement.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What happens if I do not file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The WTA is an advance on your income tax expenses, thus if you don't file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner, your agency will require you to repay the entire amount of the withholding and WTA (if any) that the agency has paid on your behalf.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I claim my RITA under the two-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To claim your RITA under the two-year process, you must submit a voucher and attach the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” as discussed in §§ 302-17.63-302-17.65.</P>
                <P>(b) Your voucher must claim a specific amount. However, your agency will calculate your actual RITA after you submit your RITA voucher and your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status;” the amount you claim on your voucher does not enter into that calculation. You should perform the RITA calculation for yourself, as a check on your agency's calculation, but you are not required to put the “right answer” on the voucher you submit to claim your RITA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does my agency calculate my RITA under the two-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Your agency calculates your RITA after receipt of your RITA voucher.</P>
                <P>(b) Your RITA is itself taxable income to you. To account for taxes on the RITA, your agency will gross-up your RITA by applying the CMTR to the final amount rather than the reimbursed amount.</P>

                <P>(c) Thus, your agency calculates your RITA by multiplying the Combined Marginal Tax Rate (CMTR) (using the state and local tax tables most current at the time of the RITA calculation) by the total of all covered taxable relocation benefits during the applicable <PRTPAGE P="237"/>Year 1, and then subtracting your WTA(s), if any, from the same Year 1 from that total. That is:</P>

                <SUBJECT>What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA under the two-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA(s) paid during Year 1, if any, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:</P>
                <P>(1) If the RITA calculation in § 302-17.67 results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as income taxes), then your agency will report this result to you and will send you a bill for the difference, to repay the excess amount that it sent to the IRS on your behalf as withheld income taxes. The IRS will credit you for the full amount of withheld taxes, including the excess amount, when you file your income tax return for Year 1; therefore, you must repay the excess amount to your agency within 90 days, or within a time period set by your agency. If you are required to repay an amount in Year 2 that was included as wages on your W-2 in Year 1, you may be entitled to a miscellaneous itemized deduction on your Federal income tax return in Year 2. For more information, see IRS Publication 535, “Business Expenses.” If your agency chooses to offer you the choice, then you may want to decline the WTA to avoid this so-called “negative RITA” situation.</P>
                <P>(2) If the RITA calculation in § 302-17.67 results in a positive value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money as income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of Year 2 and will report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year. Also, after your agency has paid your RITA to you, it will provide a W-2 that shows your RITA as taxable income to you.</P>
                <P>(b) At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W-2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA (if any), and RITA (if any), along with your regular payroll wages, or you may receive one W-2 for your regular payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I pay taxes on my RITA under the two-year process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>When income taxes are due for Year 2, you must report your RITA, if any, as taxable income on your Federal, state, and local tax returns.</P>
                <P>(a) If your relocation process results in only one Year 2, or if the previous year was your last Year 1, your RITA is the only amount that you report as income resulting from your relocation for that Year 2.</P>

                <P>(b) If, on the other hand, your relocation process results in more than one Year 2 (if, for example, you incurred relocation expenses during more than one calendar year), then, except for your last Year 2, you will need to report reimbursements, allowances, direct payments to vendors, and WTA(s), if any, for succeeding Year 1's at the <PRTPAGE P="238"/>same time that you report each Year 2's RITA.</P>
                <P>(c) See the table in § 302-17.60 for a graphic explanation of Year 1 and Year 2.</P>

                <P>Yes. You may use the services of relocation companies to manage all aspects of relocation, including the RITA computation. Agencies that relocate few employees or do not have the resources to manage the complexity of relocation may find that the use of relocation companies is a practical alternative. As another alternative, agencies with infrequent requirements for relocation or with inadequate internal resources may establish an interagency agreement with one or more other agencies to pool resources to provide this service.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are our responsibilities with regard to taxes on relocation expenses?</SUBJECT>
                <P>To ensure that all provisions of this Part are fulfilled, you must:</P>
                <P>(a) Prepare a relocation travel authorization that includes an estimate of the WTA and RITA, to obligate the funds that will be needed.</P>
                <P>(b) Determine, in light of the specific circumstances of each employee relocation, which reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable, and which are nontaxable.</P>
                <P>(c) Decide whether or not you will allow individual employees and/or categories of employees to choose not to receive the WTA.</P>
                <P>(d) Calculate the WTA, and credit the amount of the WTA to the employee at the time of reimbursement.</P>
                <P>(e) Prepare the employee's W-2 Form(s) and ensure that it (they) reflect(s) the WTA.</P>
                <P>(f) Provide each employee an itemized list of relocation expenses after the end of each calendar year in which you provided an allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor.</P>
                <P>(g) Establish processes for identifying the relevant Federal, state, and local marginal tax rates and for keeping that information current.</P>
                <P>(h) Establish processes for identifying states that treat a reimbursement or direct payment to a vendor as taxable even though it is nontaxable under the Federal IRC, and for keeping that information current.</P>
                <P>(i) Calculate the employee's CMTR(s).</P>
                <P>(j) Decide whether you will use the one-year or two-year RITA process and whether you will use different processes (that is, one-year or two-year) for different groups of employees within your agency.</P>
                <P>(k) Make sure the RITA calculation is done correctly and in a timely manner, whether your policies call for the calculation to be done by you or by a third party.</P>
                <P>(l) Make sure that payment of the RITA occurs in a timely manner (this is especially critical for the one-year process).</P>
                <P>(m) Develop criteria for accepting and rejecting requests for recalculation of RITA.</P>
                <P>(n) Establish a process for recalculating the RITA when the employee's request for recalculation is accepted.</P>
                <P>(o) Consult with IRS for clarification of any confusion stemming from taxes on relocation expenses.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What happens if an employee fails to file and/or amend a “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” prior to the required date?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If a relocating employee does not file and/or amend a “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” prior to the required date, and you are using a one-year RITA process, you are to switch to a two-year RITA process and send a written warning to the employee reminding them of the requirement and informing them that if they do not submit the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” you may declare the entire amount of the WTA forfeited.</P>

                <P>(b) If the relocating employee does not file and/or amend a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to the required date, and you are using a two-year RITA process, you are to send <PRTPAGE P="239"/>the employee a written warning informing them they have 60 days to file or amend their “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” or you will declare the WTA that you have already paid on his/her behalf forfeited and due as a debt to the Government.</P>
                <P>(c) If the relocating employee chose not to receive the WTA and fails to file a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to your required date, you are to send the employee a written warning that they have 60 days to file. If the employee still fails to file, you may close your case file and refuse any later claims for RITA related to this specific relocation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the advantages of choosing a 1-year or a 2-year RITA process?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The one-year process is simpler. It reimburses the employee more quickly, and it eases the administrative burden required to calculate the RITA. Most importantly, the one-year process eliminates the possibility of charging employees for excess payments to the IRS, the so-called “negative RITA.”</P>
                <P>(b) The two-year process provides a somewhat more accurate calculation of the additional taxes the employee incurs because it is based on the employee's actual Year One taxable income and filing status rather than the taxable income and filing status from the year before.</P>

              <P>The following definitions apply to this chapter:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Employee</E> means an appointed officer or employee of an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, including a special Government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, or an expert or consultant appointed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 3109.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Meeting(s) or similar functions (meeting)</E> means a conference, seminar, speaking engagement, symposium, training course, or similar event that takes place away from the employee's official station. “Meeting” as defined in this chapter does not include a meeting or other event required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory functions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a function that is essential to an agency's mission) such as investigations, inspections, audits, site visits, negotiations or litigation. “Meeting” also does not include promotional vendor training or other meetings held for the primary purpose of marketing the non-Federal sources products or services, or long term TDY or training travel. A meeting need not be widely attended for purposes of this definition and includes but is not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) An event where the employee will participate as a speaker or panel participant focusing on his/her official duties or on the policies, programs or operations of the agency.</P>
              <P>(2) A conference, convention, seminar, symposium or similar event where the primary purpose is to receive training other than promotional vendor training, or to present or exchange substantive information of mutual interest to a number of parties.</P>
              <P>(3) An event where the employee will receive an award or honorary degree, which is in recognition of meritorious public service that is related to the employee's official duties, and which may be accepted by the employee consistent with the applicable standards of conduct regulations.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Non-Federal source</E> means any person or entity other than the Government of the United States. The term includes any individual, private or commercial entity, nonprofit organization or association, international or multinational organization (irrespective of whether an agency holds membership in the organization or association), or foreign, State or local government (including the government of the District of Columbia).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Payment</E> means a monetary payment from a non-Federal source to a Federal agency for travel, subsistence, related expenses by check or other monetary <PRTPAGE P="254"/>instrument payable to the Federal agency (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> electronic fund transfer (EFT), money order, charge card, etc.) or payment in kind.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Payment in kind</E> means transportation, food, lodging, or other travel-related services provided by a non-Federal source instead of monetary payments to the Federal agency for these services. Payment in kind also includes waiver of any fees that a non-Federal source normally collects from meeting attendees (e.g., registration fees).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Travel, subsistence, and related expenses (travel expenses)</E> means the same types of expenses payable under chapter 301 of this title, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) for transportation, food, lodging or other travel-related services for official travel (e.g., baggage expenses, services of guides, drivers, interpreters, communication services, hire of conference rooms, lodging taxes, laundry/dry cleaning, taxi or TNC fares, or the cost of utilizing an innovative mobility technology company, etc). These expenses also include conference or training fees (in whole or in part), as well as benefits that cannot be paid under the applicable travel regulations, but which are incident to the meeting, provided in kind, and made available by the meeting sponsor(s) to all attendees. For example, this definition as applied to this chapter would allow an employee or spouse to attend a sporting event hosted by the sponsor(s) in connection with the meeting that is available to all participants. However, it would not allow the employee to accept tickets to a professional sporting event, concert or similar event, for use at a later date even if such tickets were given to all other participants.

                <P>Generally yes. Subsistence expenses are usually limited to the maximum subsistence allowances (per diem or actual expense) prescribed in chapter 301 of this title for travel in CONUS, by the Secretary of Defense for travel in non-foreign areas and by the Secretary of State for travel in foreign areas. However, acceptance of payment for, and when applicable, reimbursement by an agency to an employee and the accompanying spouse of such employee are not subject to the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates when traveling in CONUS or in non-foreign areas under the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(a) The non-Federal source pays the full amount of the subsistence expense, as authorized by your agency; and</P>
                <P>(b) The subsistence expense paid by the non-Federal source is comparable in value to that offered to or purchased by other meeting attendees; and</P>
                <P>(c) Your agency has approved acceptance of payment from the non-Federal source prior to your travel; if your agency has not approved any acceptance from the non-Federal source, you may not exceed the maximum allowances. See § 304-3.13.</P>

                <P>(a) Under 5 U.S.C. 4111 for acceptance of contributions, awards, and other payments from tax-exempt entities for non-Government sponsored training or meetings (see regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR part 410).</P>
                <P>(b) Under 5 U.S.C. 7342 for travel taking place entirely outside the United States which is paid by a foreign government, where acceptance is permitted by your agency and any regulations which may be prescribed by your agency.</P>
                <P>(c) Under 5 U.S.C. 7324(b) when payment is for travel to be performed for a partisan rather than an official purpose in accordance with the Hatch Act (5 U.S.C. 7321-7326); or</P>
                <P>(d) Pursuant to the applicable standards of ethical conduct regulations concerning personal acceptance of gifts. For example, under 5 CFR 2635.204(e), which authorizes executive branch employees to accept gifts based on outside business employment relationships. (Note: You may also be able to accept attendance at (but not other travel expenses to) a widely attended gathering under 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(2) when the gathering is not a meeting, as defined in this part, and you are not attending in your official capacity.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this part?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this part is to establish Governmentwide policy and guidance for acceptance by a Federal agency of payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source for employees to attend meetings under 31 U.S.C. 1353. It prescribes how such payments may be accepted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Under what other authority may we accept payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source?</SUBJECT>
              <P>You may accept payment for travel expenses to events other than meetings from a non-Federal source pursuant to an agency gift statute or similar statutory authority. However, this part 304 is the only authority you may use to accept (or authorize your employee to accept on your behalf) payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source to attend a meeting. For example, you could not pay the travel expenses for an employee to attend a meeting and then authorize the employee to use the widely attended gathering exception in 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(2) to accept free attendance at that same meeting. You would only be able to accept payment for the employee's attendance at that meeting under this part 304.</P>

                <P>Employees may also be able to accept payment for travel expenses from non-Federal sources in their individual capacities under the authorities referenced in § 304-3.19.</P>

              <P>(6) Monetary value and character of the travel benefits offered by the non-Federal source.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency official may find that, while acceptance from the non-Federal source is permissible, it is in the interest of the agency to qualify acceptance of the offered payment by, for example, authorizing attendance at only a portion of the event or limiting the type or character of benefits that may be accepted.</P>

                <P>(a) For conference, training, or similar fees waived or paid by a non-Federal source, you must report the amount charged other participants.</P>
                <P>(b) For transportation or lodging, you must report the cost that the non-Federal source paid or usually would have been charged for such event.</P>
                <P>(c) For meals or other benefits that are not provided as part of the transportation, lodging, or a conference, training or similar fee, you must report the cost to the non-Federal source or provide a reasonable approximation of the market value of the benefit.</P>
                <P>(d) For chartered, corporate or other private aircraft—</P>
                <P>(1) When common carrier is available, you must report the first-class rate that would have been charged by a commercial air carrier at the time the event took place.</P>
                <P>(2) When a common carrier is not available, you must report the cost of chartering a similar aircraft using a commercially available service.</P>

                <P>(e) Lodging where no commercial rate is available: You must report the maximum lodging rate established by GSA for CONUS, Department of Defense for non-foreign areas and the Secretary of State for foreign areas.
