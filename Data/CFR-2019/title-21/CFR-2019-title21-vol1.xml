      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Section 403(i) of the act provides for the establishment by regulation of exemptions from the required declaration of ingredients where such declaration is impracticable, or results in deception or unfair competition. Section 502(b) of the act provides for the establishment by regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages from the required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section 602(b) of the act provides for the establishment by regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages from the required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section 5(b) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act provides for the establishment by regulation of exemptions from certain required declarations of net quantity of contents, identity of commodity, identity and location of manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and from declaration of net quantity of servings represented, based on a finding that full compliance with such required declarations is impracticable or not necessary for the adequate protection of consumers, and a further finding that the nature, form, or quantity of the packaged consumer commodity or other good and sufficient reasons justify such exemptions. The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on petition of an interested person, may propose a variation or exemption based upon any of the foregoing statutory provisions, including proposed findings if section 5(b) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act applies, pursuant to parts 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of this chapter.</P>

                  <E T="03">Facility</E> means any establishment, structure, or structures under one ownership at one general physical location, or, in the case of a mobile facility, traveling to multiple locations, that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States. Transport vehicles are not facilities if they hold food only in the usual course of business as carriers. A facility may consist of one or more contiguous structures, and a single building may house more than one distinct facility if the facilities are under separate ownership. The private residence of an individual is not a facility. Nonbottled water drinking water collection and distribution establishments and their structures are not facilities.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Domestic facility</E> means any facility located in any State or Territory of <PRTPAGE P="26"/>the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.</P>

                <P>(1) Primary production farm. A primary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term “farm” includes operations that, in addition to these activities:</P>
                <P>(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;</P>

                <P>(ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this definition; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:</P>
                <P>(A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or</P>
                <P>(B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is slicing);</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or</P>
                <P>(2) Secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Food</E> has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:</P>
                <P>(1) Except for purposes of this subpart, it does not include:</P>
                <P>(i) Food contact substances as defined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or</P>

                  <E T="03">Harvesting</E> applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, <PRTPAGE P="27"/>Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> foliage, husks, roots or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.</P>
                <P>

Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Manufacturing/processing</E> means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Mixed-type facility</E> means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Nonprofit food establishment</E> means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States.

To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Packaging</E> (when used as a verb) means placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Packing</E> means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Restaurant</E> means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. “Restaurant” does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.</P>

                  <E T="03">Retail food establishment</E> means an establishment that sells food products directly to consumers as its primary function. The term “retail food establishment” includes facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food if the establishment's primary function is to sell from that establishment food, including food that it manufactures, processes, packs, or holds, directly to consumers. A retail food establishment's primary function is to sell food directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales of food products directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value of sales of food products to all other buyers. The term “consumers” does not include businesses. A “retail food establishment” includes grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine locations. A “retail food establishment” also includes certain farm-operated businesses selling food directly to consumers as their primary function.</P>
                <P>(1) Sale of food directly to consumers from an establishment located on a farm includes sales by that establishment directly to consumers:</P>
                <P>(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers' market (a location where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers);</P>
                <P>(ii) Through a community supported agriculture program. Community supported agriculture (CSA) program means a program under which a farmer or group of farmers grows food for a group of shareholders (or subscribers) who pledge to buy a portion of the farmer's crop(s) for that season. This includes CSA programs in which a group of farmers consolidate their crops at a central location for distribution to shareholders or subscribers; and</P>
                <P>(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer sales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and Internet order, including online farmers markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs.</P>

                <P>(3) For the purposes of this definition, “farm-operated business” means a business that is managed by one or more farms and conducts manufacturing/processing not on the farm(s).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Trade name</E> means the name or names under which the facility conducts business, or additional names by which the facility is known. A trade name is associated with a facility, and a brand name is associated with a product.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">U.S. agent</E> means a person (as defined in section 201(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(e))) residing or maintaining a place of business in the United States whom a foreign facility designates as its agent for purposes of this subpart. A U.S. agent may not be in the form of a mailbox, answering machine or service, <PRTPAGE P="29"/>or other place where an individual acting as the foreign facility's agent is not physically present.</P>
                <P>(1) The U.S. agent acts as a communications link between FDA and the foreign facility for both emergency and routine communications. The U.S. agent will be the person FDA contacts when an emergency occurs, unless the registration specifies another emergency contact.</P>
                <P>(2) FDA will treat representations by the U.S. agent as those of the foreign facility, and will consider information or documents provided to the U.S. agent the equivalent of providing the information or documents to the foreign facility. FDA will consider the U.S. agent the equivalent of the registrant for purposes of sharing information and communications. The U.S. agent of a foreign facility may view the information submitted in the foreign facility's registration.</P>
                <P>(3) Having a single U.S. agent for the purposes of this subpart does not preclude facilities from having multiple agents (such as foreign suppliers) for other business purposes. A firm's commercial business in the United States need not be conducted through the U.S. agent designated for purposes of this subpart.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">You or registrant</E> means the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.</P>

For updates not submitted by the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility, the update must provide the email address of the individual who authorized submission of the update, unless FDA has granted a waiver under § 1.245.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cancellation due to ownership changes.</E> If the reason for the update is that the facility has a new owner, the former owner must cancel the facility's registration as specified in § 1.235 within 60 calendar days of the change and the new owner must submit a new registration for the facility as specified in § 1.231.

FDA will not provide you with an electronic confirmation of your registration update until FDA verifies the accuracy of your facility's UFI and verifies that the facility-specific address associated with the UFI is the same address associated with your registration. For foreign facilities, when updating information about your U.S. agent, FDA will verify that the person identified as the U.S. agent for your foreign facility has agreed to serve as your U.S. agent.

                <SUBJECT>What other registration requirements apply?</SUBJECT>
                <P>In addition to the requirements of this subpart, you must comply with the registration regulations found in part 108 of this chapter, related to emergency permit control, and any other Federal, State, or local registration requirements that apply to your facility.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1.241</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>What are the consequences of failing to register, update, renew, or cancel your registration?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331) prohibits the doing of certain acts or causing such acts to be done. Under section 302 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 332), the United States can bring a civil action in Federal court to enjoin a person who commits a prohibited act. Under section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333), the United States can bring a criminal action in Federal court to prosecute a person who is responsible for the commission of a prohibited act. Under section 306 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek debarment of any person who has been <PRTPAGE P="36"/>convicted of a felony relating to importation of food into the United States. Failure of an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a domestic or foreign facility to register its facility, renew the registration of its facility, update required elements of its facility's registration, or cancel its registration in accordance with the requirements of this subpart is a prohibited act under section 301(dd) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
                <P>(b) FDA will consider a registration for a food facility to be expired if the registration is not renewed, as required by § 1.230(b). Thus, if you previously submitted a registration to FDA, but do not submit a registration renewal to FDA during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, FDA will consider the registration for the facility to be expired. FDA will consider a food facility with an expired registration to have failed to register in accordance with section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
                <P>(c) FDA will cancel a registration if FDA independently verifies that the facility is no longer in business or has changed owners, and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility fails to cancel the registration, or if FDA determines that the registration is for a facility that does not exist, is not required to register, or where the information about the facility's address was not updated in a timely manner in accordance with § 1.234(a) or the registration was submitted by a person not authorized to submit the registration under § 1.225. Also, FDA will cancel a registration if the facility's registration has expired because the facility has failed to renew its registration in accordance with § 1.230(b). If FDA cancels a facility's registration, FDA will send a confirmation of the cancellation using contact information submitted by the facility in the registration database.</P>
                <P>(d) If an article of food is imported or offered for import into the United States and a foreign facility that manufactured/processed, packed, or held that article of food has not registered in accordance with this subpart, the disposition of the article of food shall be governed by the procedures set out in subpart I of this part.</P>

In addition, any information derived from such list or registration documents that would disclose the identity or location of a specific registered person, is not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act).</P>

                <P>Under §§ 1.231(a)(2) and (b), 1.234(d), and 1.235(d), beginning January 4, 2020, you must submit your registration, registration renewal, updates, and cancellations to FDA electronically unless FDA has granted a waiver from such requirement. Under § 1.232(a)(6), you must provide the email address of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility unless FDA has granted a waiver from such requirement. In addition, under §§ 1.230(b) and (c), 1.232(a)(10), 1.234(a), and 1.235(b)(5), registration renewals, abbreviated registration renewals, registrations, updates, and cancellations not submitted by the owner, operator, or agent in charge must include the email address for the individual who authorized the submission, unless FDA has granted a waiver. To request a waiver from these requirements, you must submit a written request to FDA that explains why it is not reasonable for you to submit your registration, registration renewal, <PRTPAGE P="37"/>update, or cancellation to FDA electronically or to provide the email address of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility. You must submit your request to: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5001 Campus Dr. (HFS-681), College Park, MD 20740.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What happens to food that is imported or offered for import without adequate prior notice?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For each article of food that is imported or offered for import into the United States, except for food arriving by international mail or food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual, the consequences are:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Inadequate prior notice</E>—(i) <E T="03">No prior notice.</E> If an article of food arrives at the port of arrival and no prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(m)(1)). If an article of food is refused for lack of prior notice, unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry <PRTPAGE P="45"/>for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Inaccurate prior notice.</E> If prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but upon review of the notice or examination of the article of food, the notice is determined to be inaccurate, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If the article of food is refused due to inaccurate prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Untimely prior notice.</E> If prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but the full time that applies under § 1.279 for prior notice has not elapsed when the article of food arrives, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, unless FDA has already reviewed the prior notice, determined its response to the prior notice, and advised CBP of that response. If the article of food is refused due to untimely prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Status and movement of refused food.</E> (i) An article of food that has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).</P>
                <P>(ii) Refused food must be moved under appropriate custodial bond unless immediately exported under CBP supervision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified of the location where the food is held at that port before the food is moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before the food is moved there. The refused food shall not be entered and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Segregation of refused foods.</E> If an article of food that is refused is part of a shipment that contains articles of food that have not been placed under hold or other merchandise not subject to this subpart, the refused article of food may be segregated from the rest of the shipment. This segregation must take place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segregation. If FDA or CBP determines that supervision is necessary, segregation must not take place without supervision.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Costs.</E> Neither FDA nor CBP are liable for transportation, storage, or other expenses resulting from refusal.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Export after refusal.</E> An article of food that has been refused under paragraph (a) of this section may be exported with CBP concurrence and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or administratively detained by FDA or CBP under other authority. If an article of food that has been refused admission under paragraph (a) of this section is exported, the prior notice should be cancelled within 5-business days of exportation.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">No post-refusal submission or request for review.</E> If an article of food is refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and no prior notice is submitted or resubmitted, no request for FDA review is submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, or export has not occurred in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the article of food shall be dealt with as set forth in CBP regulations relating to general order merchandise (19 CFR part 127), except that, unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be sold for export or destroyed.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual.</E> If food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual arriving in the United States is not for personal use and does not have adequate prior notice or the individual cannot provide FDA or CBP with a copy of the prior notice (PN) confirmation, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If before leaving the port, the individual does not arrange to have the <PRTPAGE P="46"/>food held at the port or exported, FDA or CBP may destroy the article of food.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Post-Refusal prior notice submissions.</E> (1) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (no prior notice) and the food is not exported, prior notice must be submitted in accordance with §§ 1.280 and 1.281(c).</P>
                <P>(2) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (inaccurate prior notice) and the food is not exported, the prior notice should be canceled in accordance with § 1.282 and you must resubmit prior notice in accordance with §§ 1.280 and 1.281(c).</P>
                <P>(3) Once the prior notice has been submitted or resubmitted and confirmed by FDA for review, FDA will endeavor to review and respond to the prior notice submission within the timeframes set out in § 1.279.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">FDA review after refusal.</E> (1) If an article of food has been refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, a request may be submitted asking FDA to review whether the article is subject to the requirements of this subpart under § 1.277, or whether the information submitted in a prior notice is complete and accurate. A request for review may not be used to submit prior notice or to resubmit an inaccurate prior notice.</P>
                <P>(2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. A request must identify which one the requester is.</P>

                <P>(3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>—see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one request for review may be submitted for each refused article.</P>
                <P>(4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the refusal. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving the request.</P>
                <P>(5) If FDA determines that the article is not subject to the requirements of this subpart under § 1.277 or that the prior notice submission is complete and accurate, it will notify the requester, the transmitter, and CBP that the food is no longer subject to refusal under section 801(m)(1) of the act.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">International mail.</E> If an article of food arrives by international mail with inadequate prior notice or the PN confirmation number is not affixed as required, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If FDA refuses the article under section 801(m)(1) of the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked “No Prior Notice—FDA Refused.” If the article is refused and there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender or, if there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Prohibitions on delivery and transfer.</E> (1) Notwithstanding section 801(b) of the act, an article of food refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the article of food is no longer refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act.</P>
                <P>(2) During the time an article of food that has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act is held, the article may not be transferred by any person from the port or other designated secure facility until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the article of food no longer is refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. After this notification by FDA to CBP and transmitter, entry may be made in accordance with law and regulation.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Relationship to other admissibility decisions.</E> A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act is different <PRTPAGE P="47"/>than, and may come before, determinations of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.</P>

                <P>(a) The importing or offering for import into the United States of an article of food in violation of the requirements of section 801(m) of the act, including the requirements of this subpart, is a prohibited act under section 301(ee) of the act (21 U.S.C. 331(ee)).</P>

                <P>(1) Under section 302 of the act (21 U.S.C. 332), the United States can bring a civil action in Federal court to enjoin persons who commit a prohibited act.</P>
                <P>(2) Under sections 301 and 303 of the act (21 U.S.C. 331 and 333), the United States can bring a criminal action in Federal court to prosecute persons who are responsible for the commission of a prohibited act.</P>
                <P>(c) Under section 306 of the act (21 U.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek debarment of any person who has been convicted of a felony relating to importation of food into the United States or any person who has engaged in a pattern of importing or offering for import adulterated food that presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Consequences.</E> If an article of food from a foreign facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act (21 U.S.C. 350d) and subpart H of this part is imported or offered for import into the United States, the food is subject to being held under section 801(l) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(l)).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Hold.</E> Unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival, if an article of food has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Status and movement of held food.</E> (1) An article of food that has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act shall be considered general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).</P>

If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before the food is moved there. The food subject to hold shall not be entered and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Segregation of held foods.</E> If an article of food that has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act is part of a shipment that contains articles that have not been placed under hold, the food under hold may be segregated from the rest of the shipment.

                <P>(3) If FDA determines that the article is no longer subject to hold, it will notify the person who provided the registration information and CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">FDA review after hold.</E> (1) If an article of food has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act, a request may be submitted asking FDA to review whether the facility associated with the article is subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act. A request for review may not be submitted to obtain a registration number.</P>
                <P>(2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, importer, owner, or ultimate consignee of the article. A request must identify which one the requestor is.</P>

                <P>(3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>—see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one request for review may be submitted for each article under hold.</P>
                <P>(4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the hold. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving the request.</P>
                <P>(5) If FDA determines that the article is not from a facility subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act, it will notify the requestor and CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">International mail.</E> If an article of food that arrives by international mail is from a foreign facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If the article is placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked “No Registration—No Admission Permitted.” If the article is under hold and there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender marked “No Registration—No Admission Permitted” or, if there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Prohibitions on delivery and transfer.</E> Notwithstanding section 801(b) of the act, while an article of food is under hold under section 801(l) of the act, it may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If an article of food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act, <PRTPAGE P="49"/>entry may be made in accordance with law and regulation.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Relationship to other admissibility provisions.</E> A determination that an article of food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act is different than, and may come before, determinations of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A determination that an article of food is no longer under hold under section 801(l) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.</P>

                <P>The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Farm</E> means:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Primary production farm.</E> A primary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term “farm” includes operations that, in addition to these activities:</P>
                <P>(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;</P>

                <P>(ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this definition; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:</P>
                <P>(A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or</P>

                <P>(B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:<PRTPAGE P="51"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is slicing);</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Secondary activities farm.</E> A secondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Food</E> has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of food include, but are not limited to fruits; vegetables; fish; dairy products; eggs; raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food; animal feed, including pet food; food and feed ingredients and additives, including substances that migrate into food from the finished container and other articles that contact food; dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; infant formula; beverages, including alcoholic beverages and bottled water; live food animals; bakery goods; snack foods; candy; and canned foods.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Full-time equivalent employee</E> means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. The number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Harvesting</E> applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Holding</E> means storage of food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of a food (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold <PRTPAGE P="52"/>storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Manufacturing/processing</E> means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Mixed-type facility</E> means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Nonprofit food establishment</E> means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Nontransporter</E> means a person who owns food or who holds, manufactures, processes, packs, imports, receives, or distributes food for purposes other than transportation.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Nontransporter immediate previous source</E> means a person that last had food before transferring it to another nontransporter.</P>

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Packaging</E> (when used as a verb) means placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Packing</E> means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Person</E> includes individual, partnership, corporation, and association.</P>

                  <E T="03">Recipe</E> means the formula, including ingredients, quantities, and instructions, necessary to manufacture a food product. Because a recipe must have all three elements, a list of the ingredients used to manufacture a product without quantity information and manufacturing instructions is not a recipe.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Restaurant</E> means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. “Restaurant” does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.</P>

                <P>The regulations in this subpart do not require duplication of existing records if those records contain all of the information required by this subpart. If a covered person keeps records of all of the information as required by this subpart to comply with other Federal, State, or local regulations, or for any other reason, then those records may be used to meet these requirements. Moreover, persons do not have to keep all of the information required by this rule in one set of records. If they have records containing some of the required information, they may keep those existing records and keep, either separately or in a combined form, any new information required by this rule. There is no obligation to create an entirely new record or compilation of records containing both existing and new information, even if the records containing some of the required information were not created at the time the food was received or released.</P>

                <P>(b) If FDA determines that removal to a secure facility is appropriate, the article of food must be removed to a secure facility. A detained article of food remains under detention before, during, and after movement to a secure facility. FDA will also state in the detention order any conditions of transportation applicable to the detained article.</P>

                <P>(c) If FDA directs you to move the detained article of food to a secure facility, you must receive a modification of the detention order under § 1.381(c) before you move the detained article of food to a secure facility.<PRTPAGE P="58"/>
                </P>

The tags or labels must remain with the article of food until FDA terminates the detention order or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, unless otherwise permitted by the authorized FDA representative.</P>
                <P>(e) The movement of an article of food in violation of a detention order issued under § 1.393 is a prohibited act under section 301 of the act (21 U.S.C. 331).</P>

                <SUBJECT>May a detained article of food be delivered to another entity or transferred to another location?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An article of food subject to a detention order under this subpart may not be delivered under the execution of a bond. Notwithstanding section 801(b) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(b)), while any article of food is subject to a detention order under section 304(h) of the act (21 U.S.C. 334(h)), it may not be delivered to any of its importers, owners, or consignees. This section does not preclude movement at FDA's direction of imported food to a secure facility under an appropriate Customs' bond when that bond is required by Customs' law and regulation.</P>
                <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person may transfer a detained article of food within or from the place where it has been ordered detained, or from the place to which it was removed, until an authorized FDA representative releases the article of food under § 1.384 or the detention period expires under § 1.379, whichever occurs first.</P>
                <P>(c) The authorized FDA representative may approve, in writing, a request to modify a detention order to permit movement of a detained article of food for any of the following purposes:</P>
                <P>(1) To destroy the article of food,</P>
                <P>(2) To move the detained article of food to a secure facility under the terms of a detention order,</P>
                <P>(3) To maintain or preserve the integrity or quality of the article of food, or</P>
                <P>(4) For any other purpose that the authorized FDA representative believes is appropriate in the case.</P>
                <P>(d) You must submit your request for modification of the detention order in writing to the authorized FDA representative who approved the detention order. You must state in your request the reasons for movement; the exact address of and location in the new facility (or the new location within the same facility) where the detained article of food will be transferred; an explanation of how the new address and location will be secure, if FDA has directed that the article be detained in a secure facility; and how the article will be held under any applicable conditions described in the detention order. If you are requesting modification of a detention order for the purpose of destroying the detained article of food, you also must submit a verified statement identifying the ownership or proprietary interest you have in the detained article of food, in accordance with Supplemental Rule C to the “Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for submitting an appeal?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If you want to appeal a detention order, you must submit your appeal in writing to the FDA District Director, in whose district the detained article of food is located, at the mailing address, e-mail address, or fax number identified in the detention order according to the following applicable timeframes:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Perishable food:</E> If the detained article is a perishable food, as defined in § 1.377, you must file an appeal within 2 calendar days of receipt of the detention order.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Nonperishable food:</E> If the detained article is not a perishable food, as defined in § 1.377, you must file a notice of an intent to request a hearing within 4 calendar days of receipt of the detention order. If the notice of intent is not filed within 4 calendar days, you will not be granted a hearing. If you have not filed a timely notice of intent to request a hearing, you may file an appeal without a hearing request. Whether or not it includes a request for hearing, your appeal must be filed within 10 calendar days of receipt of the detention order.</P>
                <P>(b) Your request for appeal must include a verified statement identifying your ownership or proprietary interest in the detained article of food, in accordance with Supplemental Rule C to the “Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”</P>

                <P>(c) The process for the appeal of a detention order under this section terminates if FDA institutes either a seizure action under section 304(a) of the act or an injunction under section 302 of the act (21 U.S.C. 276) regarding the article of food involved in the detention order.<PRTPAGE P="61"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) As part of the appeals process, you may request an informal hearing. Your request for a hearing must be in writing and must be included in your request for an appeal specified in paragraph (a) of this section. If you request an informal hearing, and FDA grants your request, the hearing will be held within 2 calendar days after the date the appeal is filed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What requirements apply to an informal hearing?</SUBJECT>
                <P>If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order, FDA must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:</P>
                <P>(a) The detention order under § 1.393, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(b) A request for a hearing under this section must be addressed to the FDA District Director in whose district the article of food involved is located;</P>
                <P>(c) The provision in § 16.22(b) of this chapter, providing that a person not be given less than 3 working days after receipt of notice to request a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this subpart;</P>
                <P>(d) The provision in § 16.24(e) of this chapter, stating that a hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this subpart;</P>
                <P>(e) Section 1.406, rather than § 16.24(f) of this chapter, describes the statement that will be provided to an appellant where a detention order is based on classified information;</P>

                <P>(f) Section 1.404, rather than § 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Directors or other officials senior to a District Director, who preside at hearings under this subpart;</P>
                <P>(g) The presiding officer may require that a hearing conducted under this section be completed within 1 calendar day, as appropriate;</P>
                <P>(h) Section 16.60(e) and (f) of this chapter does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer must prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. The presiding officer must include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and must include a proposed decision, with a statement of reasons. The hearing participant may review and comment on the presiding officer's report within 4 hours of issuance of the report. The presiding officer will then issue the final agency decision.</P>
                <P>(i) Section 16.80(a)(4) of this chapter does not apply to a regulatory hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer's report of the hearing and any comments on the report by the hearing participant under § 1.403(h) are part of the administrative record.</P>
                <P>(j) No party shall have the right, under § 16.119 of this chapter to petition the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for reconsideration or a stay of the presiding officer's final agency decision.</P>
                <P>(k) If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order, the hearing must be conducted as a regulatory hearing pursuant to regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that § 16.95(b) does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. With respect to a regulatory hearing under this subpart, the administrative record of the hearing specified in §§ 16.80(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(5), and 1.403(i) constitutes the exclusive record for the presiding officer's final decision on an administrative detention. For purposes of judicial review under § 10.45 of this chapter, the record of the administrative proceeding consists of the record of the hearing and the presiding officer's final decision.</P>

If FDA either fails to provide you with an opportunity to request an informal hearing, or fails to confirm or terminate the detention order within the 5-calendar day period, the detention order is deemed terminated.</P>
                <P>(b) If you appeal the detention order, but do not request an informal hearing, the presiding officer must issue a decision on the appeal confirming or revoking the detention within 5 calendar days after the date the appeal is filed. If the presiding officer fails to confirm or terminate the detention order during such 5-calendar day period, the detention order is deemed terminated.</P>
                <P>(c) If you appeal the detention order and request an informal hearing and your hearing request is denied, the presiding officer must issue a decision on the appeal confirming or revoking the detention within 5 calendar days after the date the appeal is filed. If the presiding officer fails to confirm or terminate the detention order during such 5-calendar day period, the detention order is deemed terminated.</P>
                <P>(d) If the presiding officer confirms a detention order, the article of food continues to be detained until we terminate the detention under § 1.384 or the detention period expires under § 1.379, whichever occurs first.</P>
                <P>(e) If the presiding officer terminates a detention order, or the detention period expires, FDA must terminate the detention order as specified under § 1.384.</P>
                <P>(f) Confirmation of a detention order by the presiding officer is considered a final agency action for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 702.</P>

                <P>Where the credible evidence or information supporting the detention order is classified under the applicable Executive order as requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security (“classified information”), FDA will not provide you with this information. The presiding officer will give you notice of the general nature of the information and an opportunity to offer opposing evidence or information, if he or she may do so consistently with safeguarding the information and its source. If classified information was used to support the detention, then any confirmation of such detention will state whether it is based in whole or in part on that classified information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What foreign supplier verification and related activities must I conduct?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of approved foreign suppliers.</E> (1) You must establish and follow written procedures to ensure that you import foods only from foreign suppliers you have approved based on the evaluation conducted under § 1.505 (or, when necessary and appropriate, on a temporary basis from unapproved foreign suppliers whose foods you subject to adequate verification activities before importing the food). You must document your use of these procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) You may rely on an entity other than your foreign supplier to establish the procedures and perform and document the activities required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section provided that you review and assess that entity's documentation of the procedures and activities, and you document your review and assessment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Foreign supplier verification procedures.</E> You must establish and follow adequate written procedures for ensuring that appropriate foreign supplier verification activities are conducted with respect to the foods you import.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirement of supplier verification.</E> The foreign supplier verification activities must provide assurance that the hazards requiring a control in the food you import have been significantly minimized or prevented.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of appropriate foreign supplier verification activities</E>—(1)(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, before importing a food from a foreign supplier, you must determine and document which verification activity or activities listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, as well as the frequency with which the activity or activities must be conducted, are needed to provide adequate assurances that the food you obtain from the foreign supplier is produced in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Verification activities must address the entity or entities that are significantly minimizing or preventing the hazards or verifying that the hazards have been significantly minimized or prevented (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> when an entity other than the grower of produce subject to part 112 of this chapter harvests or packs the produce and significantly minimizes or prevents the hazard or verifies that the hazard has been significantly minimized or prevented, or when the foreign supplier's raw material supplier significantly minimizes or prevents a hazard). The determination of appropriate supplier verification activities must be based on the evaluation of the food and foreign supplier conducted under § 1.505.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Appropriate verification activities.</E> The following are appropriate supplier verification activities:</P>
              <P>(A) Onsite audits as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) Sampling and testing of a food as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section;</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Verification activities for certain serious hazards.</E> When a hazard in a food will be controlled by the foreign supplier and is one for which there is a reasonable probability that exposure to the hazard will result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, you must conduct or obtain documentation of an onsite audit of the foreign supplier before initially importing the food and at least annually thereafter, unless you make an adequate written determination that, instead of such initial and annual onsite auditing, other supplier verification activities listed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and/or less frequent onsite auditing are appropriate to provide adequate assurances that the foreign supplier is producing the food in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, based on the determination made under § 1.505.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reliance on a determination by another entity.</E> You may rely on a determination of appropriate foreign supplier verification activities in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section made by an entity other than the foreign supplier if you review and assess whether the entity's determination regarding appropriate activities (including the frequency with which <PRTPAGE P="71"/>such activities must be conducted) is appropriate. You must document your review and assessment, including documenting that the determination of appropriate verification activities was made by a qualified individual.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Performance of foreign supplier verification activities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Verification activities.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, based on the determination made in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, you must conduct (and document) or obtain documentation of one or more of the supplier verification activities listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for each foreign supplier before importing the food and periodically thereafter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Onsite audit of the foreign supplier.</E> (A) An onsite audit of a foreign supplier must be performed by a qualified auditor.</P>
              <P>(B) If the food is subject to one or more FDA food safety regulations, an onsite audit of the foreign supplier must consider such regulations and include a review of the supplier's written food safety plan, if any, and its implementation, for the hazard being controlled (or, when applicable, an onsite audit may consider relevant laws and regulations of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent to that of the United States).</P>
              <P>(C) If the onsite audit is conducted solely to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section by an audit agent of a certification body that is accredited in accordance with subpart M of this part, the audit is not subject to the requirements in that subpart.</P>
              <P>(D) You must retain documentation of each onsite audit, including the audit procedures, the dates the audit was conducted, the conclusions of the audit, any corrective actions taken in response to significant deficiencies identified during the audit, and documentation that the audit was conducted by a qualified auditor.</P>
              <P>(E) The following inspection results may be substituted for an onsite audit, provided that the inspection was conducted within 1 year of the date by which the onsite audit would have been required to be conducted:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The written results of an appropriate inspection of the foreign supplier for compliance with applicable FDA food safety regulations conducted by FDA, representatives of other Federal Agencies (such as the USDA), or representatives of State, local, tribal, or territorial agencies; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The written results of an inspection of the foreign supplier by the food safety authority of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent to that of the United States, provided that the food that is the subject of the onsite audit is within the scope of the official recognition or equivalence determination, and the foreign supplier is in, and under the regulatory oversight of, such country.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sampling and testing of the food.</E> You must retain documentation of each sampling and testing of a food, including identification of the food tested (including lot number, as appropriate), the number of samples tested, the test(s) conducted (including the analytical method(s) used), the date(s) on which the test(s) were conducted and the date of the report of the testing, the results of the testing, any corrective actions taken in response to detection of hazards, information identifying the laboratory conducting the testing, and documentation that the testing was conducted by a qualified individual.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Review of the foreign supplier's relevant food safety records.</E> You must retain documentation of each record review, including the date(s) of review, the general nature of the records reviewed, the conclusions of the review, any corrective actions taken in response to significant deficiencies identified during the review, and documentation that the review was conducted by a qualified individual.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Other appropriate activity.</E> (A) You may conduct (and document) or obtain documentation of other supplier verification activities that are appropriate based on foreign supplier performance and the risk associated with the food.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) You must retain documentation of each activity conducted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, including a description of the activity, the date on which it was conducted, the findings or results of the activity, any corrective actions taken in response to significant deficiencies identified, and documentation that the activity was conducted by a qualified individual.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reliance upon performance of activities by other entities.</E> (i) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, you may rely on supplier verification activities conducted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section by another entity provided that you review and assess the results of these activities in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may not rely on the foreign supplier itself or employees of the foreign supplier to perform supplier verification activities, except with respect to sampling and testing of food in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review of results of verification activities.</E> You must promptly review and assess the results of the verification activities that you conduct or obtain documentation of under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or that are conducted by other entities in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. You must document your review and assessment of the results of verification activities. If the results do not provide adequate assurances that the hazards requiring a control in the food you obtain from the foreign supplier have been significantly minimized or prevented, you must take appropriate action in accordance with § 1.508(a). You are not required to retain documentation of supplier verification activities conducted by other entities, provided that you can obtain the documentation and make it available to FDA in accordance with § 1.510(b).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Independence of qualified individuals conducting verification activities.</E> There must not be any financial conflicts of interests that influence the results of the verification activities set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and payment must not be related to the results of the activity.</P>

              <P>(iii) You are importing shell eggs from a foreign supplier that is not subject to the requirements of part 118 of this chapter because it has fewer than 3,000 laying hens.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicable requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Documentation of eligibility</E>—(i) <E T="03">Very small importer status.</E> (A) If you are a very small importer and you choose to comply with the requirements in this section, you must document that you meet the definition of very small importer in § 1.500 with respect to human food and/or animal food before initially importing food as a very small importer and thereafter on an annual basis by December 31 of each calendar year.</P>
              <P>(B) For the purpose of determining whether you satisfy the definition of very small importer with respect to human food and/or animal food for a given calendar year, the relevant 3-year period of sales (and U.S. market value of human or animal food, as appropriate) is the period ending 1 year before the calendar year for which you intend to import food as a very small importer. The baseline year for calculating the adjustment for inflation is 2011. If you conduct any food sales in currency other than U.S. dollars, you must use the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on December 31 of the year in which sales occurred to calculate the value of these sales.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Review of recognition or renewal application.</E> FDA will examine an accreditation body's recognition or renewal application for completeness and notify the applicant of any deficiencies. FDA will review an accreditation body's recognition or renewal application on a first in, first out basis according to the date on which the completed application was submitted; however, FDA may prioritize the review of specific applications to meet the needs of the program.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation of recognition or renewal.</E> FDA will evaluate any completed recognition or renewal application to determine whether the applicant meets the applicable requirements of this subpart. Such evaluation may include an onsite assessment of the accreditation body. FDA will notify the applicant, in writing, regarding whether the application has been approved or denied. FDA may make such notification electronically. If FDA does not reach a final decision on a renewal application before an accreditation body's recognition terminates by expiration, FDA may extend such recognition for a specified period of time or until the Agency reaches a final decision on the renewal application.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Issuance of recognition.</E> FDA will notify an applicant that its recognition or renewal application has been approved through issuance of recognition that will list any limitations associated with the recognition.</P>

                <P>(g) <E T="03">Effect of denial of an application for renewal of recognition of an accreditation body on food or facility certifications issued to eligible entities.</E> A food or facility certification issued by a third-party certification body accredited by a recognized accreditation body prior to issuance of a denial of the renewal application will remain in effect until the certification expires. If FDA has reason to believe that a certification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&amp;C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the certification in determining the admissibility of the article of food for which the certification was offered or in determining the importer's eligibility for participation in the voluntary qualified importer program (VQIP).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Public notice of denial of an application for renewal of recognition of an accreditation body.</E> FDA will provide notice on the Web site described in § 1.690 of the date of issuance of a denial of a renewal application and will describe the basis for the denial.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Audit planning.</E> Before beginning to conduct a food safety audit under this subpart, an accredited third-party certification body must:</P>
                <P>(1) Require the eligible entity seeking a food safety audit to:</P>
                <P>(i) Identify the scope and purpose of the food safety audit, including the facility, process(es), or food to be audited; whether the food safety audit is to be conducted as a consultative or regulatory audit subject to the requirements of this subpart, and if a regulatory audit, the type(s) of certification(s) sought; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Provide a 30-day operating schedule for such facility that includes information relevant to the scope and purpose of the audit; and</P>
                <P>(2) Determine whether the requested audit is within its scope of accreditation.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to audit.</E> In arranging a food safety audit with an eligible entity under this subpart, an accredited third-party certification body must ensure it has authority, whether contractual or otherwise, to:</P>
                <P>(1) Conduct an unannounced audit to determine whether the facility, process(es), and food of the eligible entity (within the scope of the audit) comply with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations and, for consultative audits, also includes conformance with applicable industry standards and practices;</P>
                <P>(2) Access any records and any area of the facility, process(es), and food of the eligible entity relevant to the scope and purpose of such audit;</P>
                <P>(3) When, for a regulatory audit, sampling and analysis is conducted, the accredited third-party certification body must use a laboratory that is accredited in accordance with:</P>
                <P>(i) ISO/IEC 17025:2005; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Another laboratory accreditation standard that provides at least a similar level of assurance in the validity and reliability of sampling methodologies, analytical methodologies, and analytical results.</P>
                <P>(4) Notify FDA immediately if, at any time during a food safety audit, the accredited third-party certification body (or its audit agent, where applicable) discovers a condition that could cause or contribute to a serious risk to the public health and provide information required by § 1.656(c);</P>
                <P>(5) Prepare reports of audits conducted under this subpart as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) For consultative audits, prepare reports that contain the elements specified in § 1.652(a) and maintain such records, subject to FDA access in accordance with section 414 of the FD&amp;C Act; and</P>
                <P>(ii) For regulatory audits, prepare reports that contain the elements specified in § 1.652(b) and submit them to FDA and to its recognized accreditation body (where applicable) under § 1.656(a); and</P>
                <P>(6) Allow FDA and the recognized accreditation body that accredited such third-party certification body, if any, to observe any food safety audit conducted under this subpart for purposes of evaluating the accredited third-party certification body's performance under §§ 1.621 and 1.662 or, where appropriate, the recognized accreditation body's performance under §§ 1.622 and 1.633.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Audit protocols.</E> An accredited third-party certification body (or its audit agent, where applicable) must conduct a food safety audit in a manner consistent with the identified scope and purpose of the audit and within the scope of its accreditation.</P>
                <P>(1) With the exception of records review, which may be scheduled, the audit must be conducted without announcement during the 30-day timeframe identified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section and must be focused on determining whether the facility, its process(es), and food are in compliance with applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations, and, for consultative audits, also includes conformance with applicable industry standards and practices that are within the scope of the audit.</P>

                <P>(2) The audit must include records review prior to the onsite examination; an onsite examination of the facility, its process(es), and the food that results from such process(es); and where appropriate or when required by FDA, <PRTPAGE P="97"/>environmental or product sampling and analysis. When, for a regulatory audit, sampling and analysis is conducted, the accredited third-party certification body must use a laboratory that is accredited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The audit may include any other activities necessary to determine compliance with applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations, and, for consultative audits, also includes conformance with applicable industry standards and practices.</P>
                <P>(3) The audit must be sufficiently rigorous to allow the accredited third-party certification body to determine whether the eligible entity is in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations, and for consultative audits, also includes conformance with applicable industry standards and practices, at the time of the audit; and for a regulatory audit, whether the eligible entity, given its food safety system and practices would be likely to remain in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations for the duration of any certification issued under this subpart. An accredited third-party certification body (or its audit agent, where applicable) that identifies a deficiency requiring corrective action may verify the effectiveness of a corrective action once implemented by the eligible entity but must not recommend or provide input to the eligible entity in identifying, selecting, or implementing the corrective action.</P>
                <P>(4) Audit observations and other data and information from the examination, including information on corrective actions, must be documented and must be used to support the findings contained in the audit report required by § 1.652 and maintained as a record under § 1.658.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for issuance of a food or facility certification.</E> (1) Prior to issuing a food or facility certification to an eligible entity, an accredited third-party certification body (or, where applicable, an audit agent on its behalf) must complete a regulatory audit that meets the requirements of § 1.651 and any other activities that may be necessary to determine compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations.</P>

                <P>(2) If, as a result of an observation during a regulatory audit, an eligible entity must implement a corrective action plan to address a deficiency, an accredited third-party certification body <PRTPAGE P="99"/>may not issue a food or facility certification to such entity until after the accredited third-party certification body verifies that eligible entity has implemented the corrective action plan through methods that reliably verify the corrective action was taken and as a result the identified deficiency is unlikely to recur, except onsite verification is required for corrective actions required to address deficiencies that are the subject of a notification under § 1.656(c).</P>
                <P>(3) An accredited third-party certification body must consider each observation and the data and other information from a regulatory audit and other activities conducted under § 1.651 to determine whether the entity was in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations at the time of the audit and whether the eligible entity, given its food safety system and practices, would be likely to remain in compliance for the duration of any certification issued under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) A single regulatory audit may result in issuance of one or more food or facility certifications under this subpart, provided that the requirements of issuance are met as to each such certification.</P>
                <P>(5) Where an accredited third-party certification body uses an audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of an eligible entity under this subpart, the accredited third-party certification body (and not the audit agent) must make the determination whether to issue a food or facility certification based on the results of such regulatory audit.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of a food or facility certification and submission to FDA.</E> (1) Any food or facility certification issued under this subpart must be submitted to FDA electronically and in English. The accredited third-party certification body may issue a food or facility certification under this subpart for a term of up to 12 months.</P>
                <P>(2) A food or facility certification must contain, at a minimum, the following elements:</P>
                <P>(i) The name and address of the accredited third-party certification body and the scope and date of its accreditation under this subpart;</P>
                <P>(ii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the eligible entity to which the food or facility certification was issued;</P>
                <P>(iii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the facility where the regulatory audit was conducted, if different than the eligible entity;</P>
                <P>(iv) The scope and date(s) of the regulatory audit and the certification number;</P>
                <P>(v) The name of the audit agent(s) (where applicable) conducting the regulatory audit; and</P>
                <P>(vi) The scope of the food or facility certification, date of issuance, and date of expiration.</P>
                <P>(3) FDA may refuse to accept any certification for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&amp;C Act, if FDA determines, that such food or facility certification is not valid or reliable because, for example:</P>
                <P>(i) The certification is offered in support of the admissibility of a food that was not within the scope of the certification;</P>
                <P>(ii) The certification was issued by an accredited third-party certification body acting outside the scope of its accreditation under this subpart; or</P>

                <SUBJECT>How will FDA monitor accredited third-party certification bodies?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) FDA will periodically evaluate the performance of each accredited third-party certification body to determine whether the accredited third-party certification body continues to comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart and whether there are deficiencies in the performance of the accredited third-party certification body that, if not corrected, would warrant withdrawal of its accreditation under § 1.664. FDA will evaluate each directly accredited third-party certification body annually. For a third-party certification body accredited by a recognized accreditation body, FDA will evaluate an accredited third-party certification body not later than 3 years after the date of <PRTPAGE P="104"/>accreditation for a 4-year term of accreditation, or by no later than the mid-term point for accreditation granted for less than 4 years. FDA may conduct additional performance assessments of an accredited third-party certification body at any time.</P>
                <P>(b) In evaluating the performance of an accredited third-party certification body under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA may review any one or more of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Regulatory audit reports and food and facility certifications;</P>
                <P>(2) The accredited third-party certification body's self-assessments under § 1.655;</P>

                <P>(5) Information obtained by FDA, including during inspections, audits, onsite observations, or investigations, of one or more eligible entities to which a food or facility certification was issued by such accredited third-party certification body.</P>
                <P>(c) FDA may conduct its evaluation of an accredited third-party certification body through a site visit to an accredited third-party certification body's headquarters (or other location that manages audit agents conducting food safety audits under this subpart, if different than its headquarters), through onsite observation of an accredited third party certification body's performance during a food safety audit of an eligible entity, or through document review.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I request an FDA waiver or waiver extension for the 13-month limit for audit agents conducting regulatory audits?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An accredited third-party certification body may submit a request to FDA to waive the requirements of § 1.650(c) preventing an audit agent from conducting a regulatory audit of an eligible entity if the audit agent (or, in the case that the third-party certification body is an individual, the third-party certification body) has conducted a food safety audit of such entity during the previous 13 months. The accredited third-party certification body seeking a waiver or waiver extension must demonstrate there is insufficient access to audit agents and any third-party certification bodies that are comprised of an individual in the country or region where the eligible entity is located.</P>
                <P>(b) Requests for a waiver or waiver extension and all documents provided in support of the request must be submitted to FDA electronically, in English. The requestor must provide such translation and interpretation services as are needed by FDA to process the request.</P>
                <P>(c) The request must be signed by the requestor or by any individual authorized to act on behalf of the requestor for purposes of seeking such waiver or waiver extension.</P>
                <P>(d) FDA will review requests for waivers and waiver extensions on a first in, first out basis according to the date on which the completed submission is received; however, FDA may prioritize the review of specific requests to meet the needs of the program. FDA will evaluate any completed waiver request to determine whether the criteria for waiver have been met.</P>
                <P>(e) FDA will notify the requestor whether the request for a waiver or waiver extension is approved or denied.</P>
                <P>(f) If FDA approves the request, issuance of the waiver will state the duration of the waiver and list any limitations associated with it. If FDA denies the request, the issuance of a denial of a waiver request will state the basis for denial and will provide the address and procedures for requesting reconsideration of the request under § 1.691.</P>
                <P>(g) Unless FDA notifies a requestor that its waiver request has been approved, an accredited third-party certification body must not use the audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of such eligible entity until the 13-month limit in § 1.650(c) has elapsed.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> (1) FDA will accept applications from third-party certification bodies for direct accreditation or renewal of direct accreditation only if FDA determines that it has not identified and recognized an accreditation body to meet the requirements of section 808 of the FD&amp;C Act within 2 years after establishing the accredited third-party audits and certification program. Such FDA determination may apply, as appropriate, to specific types of third-party certification bodies, types of expertise, or geographic location; or through identification by FDA of any requirements of section 808 of the FD&amp;C Act not otherwise met by previously recognized accreditation bodies. FDA will only accept applications for direct accreditation and renewal applications that are within the scope of the determination.</P>
                <P>(2) FDA may revoke or modify a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if FDA subsequently identifies and recognizes an accreditation body that affects such determination.</P>
                <P>(3) FDA will provide notice on the Web site described in § 1.690 of a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and of a revocation or modification of the determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for direct accreditation or renewal of direct accreditation.</E> (1) A third-party certification body seeking direct accreditation or renewal of direct accreditation must submit an application to FDA, demonstrating that it is within the scope of the determination issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and it meets the eligibility requirements of § 1.640.</P>
                <P>(2) Applications and all documents provided as part of the application process must be submitted electronically, in English. An applicant must provide such translation and interpretation services as are needed by FDA to process the application, including during an onsite audit of the applicant.</P>
                <P>(3) The application must be signed in the manner designated by FDA by an individual authorized to act on behalf of the applicant for purposes of seeking or renewing direct accreditation.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Review of a direct accreditation or renewal application.</E> FDA will examine a third-party certification body's direct accreditation or renewal application for completeness and notify the applicant of any deficiencies. FDA will review applications for direct accreditation and for renewal of direct accreditation on a first in, first out basis according to the date the completed submission is received; however, FDA may prioritize the review of specific applications to meet the needs of the program.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation of a direct accreditation or renewal application.</E> FDA will evaluate any completed application to determine whether the applicant meets the requirements for direct accreditation under this subpart.

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1.980</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Administrative detention of drugs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section sets forth the procedures for detention of drugs believed to be adulterated or misbranded. Administrative detention is intended to protect the public by preventing distribution or use of drugs encountered during inspections that may be adulterated or misbranded, until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had time to consider what action it should take concerning the drugs, and to initiate legal action, if appropriate. Drugs that FDA orders detained may not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner by any person during the detention period, except as authorized under paragraph (h) of this section, until FDA terminates the detention order under paragraph (j) of this section, or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for ordering detention.</E> Administrative detention of drugs may be ordered in accordance with this section <PRTPAGE P="120"/>when an authorized FDA representative, during an inspection under section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, has reason to believe that a drug, as defined in section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is adulterated or misbranded.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Detention period.</E> The detention is to be for a reasonable period that may not exceed 20 calendar days after the detention order is issued, unless the FDA District Director in whose district the drugs are located determines that a greater period is required to seize the drugs, to institute injunction proceedings, or to evaluate the need for legal action, in which case the District Director may authorize detention for 10 additional calendar days. The additional 10-calendar-day detention period may be ordered at the time the detention order is issued or at any time thereafter. The entire detention period may not exceed 30 calendar days, except when the detention period is extended under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. An authorized FDA representative may, in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section, terminate a detention before the expiration of the detention period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Issuance of detention order.</E> (1) The detention order must be issued in writing, in the form of a detention notice, signed by the authorized FDA representative who has reason to believe that the drugs are adulterated or misbranded, and issued to the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the place where the drugs are located. If the owner or the user of the drugs is different from the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the place where the drugs are detained, a copy of the detention order must be provided to the owner or user of the drugs if the owner's or user's identity can be readily determined.</P>
              <P>(2) If detention of drugs in a vehicle or other carrier is ordered, a copy of the detention order must be provided to the shipper of record and the owner of the vehicle or other carrier, if their identities can be readily determined.</P>
              <P>(3) The detention order must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement that the drugs identified in the order are detained for the period shown;</P>
              <P>(ii) A brief, general statement of the reasons for the detention;</P>
              <P>(iii) The location of the drugs;</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement that these drugs are not to be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner during that period, except as permitted under paragraph (h) of this section, without the written permission of an authorized FDA representative;</P>
              <P>(v) Identification of the detained drugs;</P>
              <P>(vi) The detention order number;</P>
              <P>(vii) The date and hour of the detention order;</P>
              <P>(viii) The period of the detention;</P>
              <P>(ix) The text of section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(x) A statement that any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter, with certain exceptions described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(xi) The location and telephone number of the FDA district office and the name of the FDA District Director.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval of detention order.</E> A detention order, before issuance, must be approved by the FDA District Director in whose district the drugs are located. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval must be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum within FDA as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Labeling or marking a detained drug.</E> An FDA representative issuing a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section must label or mark the drugs with official FDA tags that include the following information:</P>

              <P>(1) A statement that the drugs are detained by the U.S. Government in accordance with section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 334(g)).<PRTPAGE P="121"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A statement that the drugs must not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner for the period shown, without the written permission of an authorized FDA representative, except as authorized in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) A statement that the violation of a detention order or the removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333)).</P>
              <P>(4) The detention order number, the date and hour of the detention order, the detention period, and the name of the FDA representative who issued the detention order.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Appeal of a detention order.</E> (1) A person who would be entitled to claim the drugs, if seized, may appeal a detention order. Any appeal must be submitted in writing to the FDA District Director in whose district the drugs are located within 5 working days of receipt of a detention order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, as defined in section 201(x) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)), the appellant must request either that a hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or that the hearing be held at a later date, which must not be later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order.</P>
              <P>(2) The appellant of a detention order must state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the detained drugs. If the detained drugs are located at a place other than an establishment owned or operated by the appellant, the appellant must include documents showing that the appellant would have legitimate authority to claim the drugs if seized.</P>
              <P>(3) Any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) The detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(ii) A request for a hearing under this section should be addressed to the FDA District Director;</P>
              <P>(iii) The last sentence of § 16.24(e) of this chapter, stating that a hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this section;</P>

              <P>(iv) Paragraph (g)(4) of this section, rather than § 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Directors or other FDA officials senior to an FDA District Director, who preside at hearings under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The presiding officer of a regulatory hearing on an appeal of a detention order, who also must decide the appeal, must be an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA District Director who is permitted by § 16.42(a) of this chapter to preside over the hearing.</P>
              <P>(5) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that the hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, the presiding officer must, within 5 working days, hold the hearing and render a decision affirming or revoking the detention.</P>
              <P>(6) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that the hearing be held at a date later than within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, but not later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order, the presiding officer must hold the hearing at a date agreed upon by FDA and the appellant. The presiding officer must decide whether to affirm or revoke the detention within 5 working days after the conclusion of the hearing. The detention period extends to the date of the decision even if the 5-working-day period for making the decision extends beyond the otherwise applicable 20-calendar-day or 30-calendar-day detention period.</P>

              <P>(7) If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a regulatory hearing, the presiding officer must render a decision on the appeal, affirming or revoking the detention within 5 working days after the filing of the appeal.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) If the presiding officer affirms a detention order, the drugs continue to be detained until FDA terminates the detention under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.</P>
              <P>(9) If the presiding officer revokes a detention order, FDA must terminate the detention under paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Movement of detained drugs.</E> (1) Except as provided in this paragraph, no person may move detained drugs within or from the place where they have been ordered detained until FDA terminates the detention under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.</P>
              <P>(2) If detained drugs are not in final form for shipment, the manufacturer may move them within the establishment where they are detained to complete the work needed to put them in final form. As soon as the drugs are moved for this purpose, the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible district office official, of the movement of the drugs. As soon as the drugs are put in final form, they must be segregated from other drugs, and the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible district office official, of their new location. The drugs put in final form must not be moved further without FDA approval.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible district office official, may approve, in writing, the movement of detained drugs for any of the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(i) To prevent interference with an establishment's operations or harm to the drugs;</P>
              <P>(ii) To destroy the drugs;</P>
              <P>(iii) To bring the drugs into compliance;</P>
              <P>(iv) For any other purpose that the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or other responsible district office official, believes is appropriate in the case.</P>
              <P>(4) If an FDA representative approves the movement of detained drugs under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the detained drugs must remain segregated from other drugs and the person responsible for their movement must immediately orally notify the official who approved the movement of the drugs, or another responsible FDA district office official, of the new location of the detained drugs.</P>
              <P>(5) Unless otherwise permitted by the FDA representative who is notified of, or who approves, the movement of drugs under this paragraph, the required tags must accompany the drugs during and after movement and must remain with the drugs until FDA terminates the detention or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Actions involving adulterated or misbranded drugs.</E> If FDA determines that the detained drugs, including any that have been put in final form, are adulterated or misbranded, or both, it may initiate legal action against the drugs or the responsible individuals, or both, or request that the drugs be destroyed or otherwise brought into compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act under FDA's supervision.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Detention termination.</E> If FDA decides to terminate a detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, an FDA representative authorized to terminate a detention will issue a detention termination notice releasing the drugs to any person who received the original detention order or that person's representative and will remove, or authorize in writing the removal of, the required labels or tags.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> (1) After issuance of a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, the owner, operator, or agent in charge of any factory, warehouse, other establishment, or consulting laboratory where detained drugs are manufactured, processed, packed, or held, must have, or establish, and maintain adequate records relating to how the detained drugs may have become adulterated or misbranded, records on any distribution of the drugs before and after the detention period, records on the correlation of any in-process detained drugs that are put in final form under paragraph (h) of this section to the completed drugs, records of any changes in, or processing of, the drugs <PRTPAGE P="123"/>permitted under the detention order, and records of any other movement under paragraph (h) of this section. Records required under this paragraph must be provided to FDA on request for review and copying. Any FDA request for access to records required under this paragraph must be made at a reasonable time, must state the reason or purpose for the request, and must identify to the fullest extent practicable the information or type of information sought in the records to which access is requested.</P>
              <P>(2) Records required under this paragraph must be maintained for a maximum period of 2 years after the issuance of the detention order or for such other shorter period as FDA directs. When FDA terminates the detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, FDA will advise all persons required under this paragraph to keep records concerning that detention whether further recordkeeping is required for the remainder of the 2-year, or shorter, period. FDA ordinarily will not require further recordkeeping if the Agency determines that the drugs are not adulterated or misbranded or that recordkeeping is not necessary to protect the public health, unless the records are required under other regulations in this chapter (e.g., the good manufacturing practice regulation in part 211 of this chapter).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Imminent hazard to the public health.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act an imminent hazard to the public health is considered to exist when the evidence is sufficient to show that a product or practice, posing a significant threat of danger to health, creates a public health situation (1) that should be corrected immediately to prevent injury and (2) that should not be permitted to continue while a hearing or other formal proceeding is being held. The <E T="03">imminent hazard</E> may be declared at any point in the chain of events which may ultimately result in harm to the public health. The occurrence of the final anticipated injury is not essential to establish that an <E T="03">imminent hazard</E> of such occurrence exists.</P>
              <P>(b) In exercising his judgment on whether an <E T="03">imminent hazard</E> exists, the Commissioner will consider the number of injuries anticipated and the nature, severity, and duration of the anticipated injury.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Examination and investigation samples.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) When any officer or employee of the Department collects a sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the act, the sample shall be designated as an official sample if records or other evidence is obtained by him or any other officer or employee of the Department indicating that the shipment or other lot of the article from which such sample was collected was <PRTPAGE P="124"/>introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, or was in or was received in interstate commerce, or was manufactured within a Territory. Only samples so designated by an officer or employee of the Department shall be considered to be official samples.</P>

              <P>(2) For the purpose of determining whether or not a sample is collected for analysis, the term <E T="03">analysis</E> includes examinations and tests.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner of a food, drug, or cosmetic of which an official sample is collected is the person who owns the shipment or other lot of the article from which the sample is collected.</P>
              <P>(b) When an officer or employee of the Department collects an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the act, he shall collect at least twice the quantity estimated by him to be sufficient for analysis, unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount of the article available and reasonably accessible for sampling is less than twice the quantity so estimated, in which case he shall collect as much as is available and reasonably accessible.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of twice the quantity so estimated exceeds $150.</P>
              <P>(3) The sample cannot by diligent use of practicable preservation techniques available to the Food and Drug Administration be kept in a state in which it could be readily and meaningfully analyzed in the same manner and for the same purposes as the Food and Drug Administration's analysis.</P>
              <P>(4) The sample is collected from a shipment or other lot which is being imported or offered for import into the United States.</P>
              <P>(5) The sample is collected from a person named on the label of the article or his agent, and such person is also the owner of the article.</P>
              <P>(6) The sample is collected from the owner of the article, or his agent, and such article bears no label or, if it bears a label, no person is named thereon.</P>
              <FP>In addition to the quantity of sample set forth in this paragraph, the officer or employee shall, if practicable, collect such further amount as he estimates will be sufficient for use as trial exhibits.</FP>
              <P>(c) After the Food and Drug Administration has completed such analysis of an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic as it determines, in the course of analysis and interpretation of analytical results, to be adequate to establish the respects, if any, in which the article is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act, or otherwise subject to the prohibitions of the act, and has reserved an amount of the article it estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in the trial of any case that may arise under the act based on the sample, a part of the sample, if any remains available, shall be provided for analysis, upon written request, by any person named on the label of the article, or the owner thereof, or the attorney or agent of such person or owner, except when:</P>
              <P>(1) After collection, the sample or remaining part thereof has become decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis, or</P>
              <P>(2) The request is not made within a reasonable time before the trial of any case under the act, based on the sample to which such person or owner is a party. The person, owner, attorney, or agent who requests the part of sample shall specify the amount desired. A request from an owner shall be accompanied by a showing of ownership, and a request from an attorney or agent by a showing of authority from such person or owner to receive the part of sample. When two or more requests for parts of the same sample are received the requests shall be complied with in the order in which they were received so long as any part of the sample remains available therefor.</P>

              <P>(d) When an official sample of food, drug, or cosmetic is the basis of a notice given under section 305 of the act, or of a case under the act, and the person to whom the notice was given, or any person who is a party to the case, has no right under paragraph (c) of this section to a part of the sample, such person or his attorney or agent may obtain a part of the sample upon request accompanied by a written waiver of right under such paragraph (c) from each person named on the label of the article and owner thereof, who has not <PRTPAGE P="125"/>exercised his right under such paragraph (c). The operation of this paragraph shall be subject to the exceptions, terms, and conditions prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) The Food and Drug Administration is authorized to destroy:</P>
              <P>(1) Any official sample when it determines that no analysis of such sample will be made;</P>
              <P>(2) Any official sample or part thereof when it determines that no notice under section 305 of the act, and no case under the act, is or will be based on such sample;</P>
              <P>(3) Any official sample or part thereof when the sample was the basis of a notice under section 305 of the act, and when, after opportunity for presentation of views following such notice, it determines that no other such notice, and no case under the act, is or will be based on such sample;</P>
              <P>(4) Any official sample or part thereof when the sample was the basis of a case under the act which has gone to final judgment, and when it determines that no other such case is or will be based on such sample;</P>
              <P>(5) Any official sample or part thereof if the article is perishable;</P>
              <P>(6) Any official sample or part thereof when, after collection, such sample or part has become decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Methods of analysis.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Where the method of analysis is not prescribed in a regulation, it is the policy of the Food and Drug Administration in its enforcement programs to utilize the methods of analysis of the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC) as published in the latest edition (13th Ed., 1980) of their publication “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” and the supplements thereto (“Changes in Methods” as published in the March issues of the “Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists”), which are incorporated by reference, when available and applicable. Copies are available from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</E> In the absence of an AOAC method, the Commissioner will furnish a copy of the particular method, or a reference to the published method, that the Food and Drug Administration will use in its enforcement program. Other methods may be used for quality control, specifications, contracts, surveys, and similar nonregulatory functions, but it is expected that they will be calibrated in terms of the method which the Food and Drug Administration uses in its enforcement program. Use of an AOAC method does not relieve the practioner of the responsibility to demonstrate that he can perform the method properly through the use of positive and negative controls and recovery and reproducibility studies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Grain seed treated with poisonous substances; color identification to prevent adulteration of human and animal food.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) In recent years there has developed increasing use of poisonous treatments on seed for fungicidal and other purposes. Such treated seed, if consumed, presents a hazard to humans and livestock. It is not unusual for stocks of such treated food seeds to remain on hand after the planting season has passed. Despite the cautions required by the Federal Seed Act (53 Stat. 1275, as amended 72 Stat. 476, 7 U.S.C. 1551 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) in the labeling of the treated seed, the Food and Drug Administration has encountered many cases where such surplus stocks of treated wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum seed had been mixed with untreated seed and sent to market for <PRTPAGE P="126"/>food or feed use. This has resulted in livestock injury and in legal actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act against large quantities of food adulterated through such admixture of poisonous treated seeds with good food. Criminal cases were brought against some firms and individuals. Where the treated seeds are prominently colored, buyers and users or processors of agricultural food seed for food purposes are able to detect the admixture of the poisonous seed and thus reject the lots; but most such buyers, users, and processors do not have the facilities or scientific equipment to determine the presence of the poisonous chemical at the time crops are delivered, in cases where the treated seeds have not been so colored. A suitable color for this use is one that is in sufficient contrast to the natural color of the food seed as to make admixture of treated, denatured seeds with good food easily apparent, and is so applied that it is not readily removed.</P>
              <P>(b) On and after December 31, 1964, the Food and Drug Administration will regard as adulterated any interstate shipment of the food seeds wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum bearing a poisonous treatment in excess of a recognized tolerance or treatment for which no tolerance or exemption from tolerance is recognized in regulations promulgated pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, unless such seeds have been adequately denatured by a suitable color to prevent their subsequent inadvertent use as food for man or feed for animals.</P>
              <P>(c) Attention is called to the labeling requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, where applicable to denatured seeds in packages suitable for household use.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of secondhand containers for the shipment or storage of food and animal feed.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration, the National Communicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health Service, the Consumer and Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and by various State public health agencies have revealed practices whereby food and animal feed stored or shipped in secondhand containers have been rendered dangerous to health. Such contamination has been the result of the original use of these containers for the storage and shipment of articles containing or bearing disease organisms or poisonous or deleterious substances.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner concludes that such dangerous or potentially dangerous practices include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Some vegetable growers and packers employ used poultry crates for shipment of fresh vegetables, including cabbage and celery. Salmonella organisms are commonly present on dressed poultry and in excreta and fluid exudates from dressed birds. Thus wooden crates in which dressed poultry has been iced and packed are potential sources of Salmonella or other enteropathogenic microorganisms that may contaminate fresh vegetables which are frequently consumed without heat treatment.</P>
              <P>(2) Some potato growers and producers of animal feeds use secondhand bags for shipment of these articles. Such bags may have originally been used for shipping or storing pesticide-treated seed or other articles bearing or containing poisonous substances. Thus these secondhand bags are potential sources of contamination of the food or animal feed stored or shipped therein.</P>
              <P>(c) In a policy statement issued April 11, 1968, the Food and Drug Administration declared adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shipments of vegetables or other edible food in used crates or containers that may render the contents injurious to health. This policy statement is extended so that the Food and Drug Administration will regard as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) of the act shipments of vegetables, other edible food, or animal feed in used crates, bags, or other containers that may render the contents injurious to health.</P>

              <P>(i) Substantial technical barriers exist to formulating the investigational product without ODSs;</P>
              <P>(ii) A high probability exists that the investigational product will provide an unavailable important public health benefit; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Use of the investigational product does not release cumulatively significant amounts of ODSs into the atmosphere or the release is warranted in view of the high probability of an unavailable important public health benefit.</P>

              <P>(g) Any person may file a petition under part 10 of this chapter to request that FDA initiate rulemaking to amend paragraph (e) of this section to remove an essential use. FDA may initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking to remove an essential use on its own initiative or in response to a petition, if granted. If the petition is to remove <PRTPAGE P="128"/>an essential use from paragraph (e) of this section, the petitioner must submit compelling evidence of any one of the following criteria:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This regulation relates to agency management and organization and has two purposes. The first is to implement section 503(g) of the act, as added by section 16 of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-629) and amended by section 204 of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-250), by specifying how FDA will determine the organizational component within FDA designated to have primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of products that are comprised of any combination of a drug and a device; a device and a biological; a biological and a drug; or a drug, a device and a biological. This determination will eliminate, in most cases, the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for such combination products. The second purpose of this regulation is to enhance the efficiency of agency management and operations by providing procedures for determining which agency component will have primary jurisdiction for any drug, device, or biological product <PRTPAGE P="129"/>where such jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. Nothing in this section prevents FDA from using any agency resources it deems necessary to ensure adequate review of the safety and effectiveness of any product, or the substantial equivalence of any device to a predicate device.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Act</E> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency component</E> means the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or alternative organizational component of the agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicant</E> means any person who submits or plans to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration for premarket review. For purposes of this section, the terms “sponsor” and “applicant” have the same meaning.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Biological product</E> has the meaning given the term in section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Combination product</E> includes:</P>
              <P>(1) A product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;</P>
              <P>(2) Two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;</P>
              <P>(3) A drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Device</E> has the meaning given the term in section 201(h) of the act.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Drug</E> has the meaning given the term in section 201(g)(1) of the act.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">FDA</E> means Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Letter of designation</E> means the written notice issued by the product jurisdiction officer specifying the agency component with primary jurisdiction for a combination product.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Letter of request</E> means an applicant's written submission to the product jurisdiction officer seeking the designation of the agency component with primary jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Mode of action</E> is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. For purposes of this definition, “therapeutic” action or effect includes any effect or action of the combination product intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or affect the structure or any function of the body. When making assignments of combination products under this part, the agency will consider three types of mode of action: The actions provided by a biological product, a device, and a drug. Because combination products are comprised of more than one type of regulated article (biological product, device, or drug), and each constituent part contributes a biological product, device, or drug mode of action, combination products will typically have more than one identifiable mode of action.</P>

              <P>(1) A constituent part has a biological product mode of action if it acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human <PRTPAGE P="130"/>beings, as described in section 351(i) of the Public Health Service Act.</P>
              <P>(2) A constituent part has a device mode of action if it meets the definition of device contained in section 201(h)(1) to (h)(3) of the act, it does not have a biological product mode of action, and it does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) A constituent part has a drug mode of action if it meets the definition of drug contained in section 201(g)(1) of the act and it does not have a biological product or device mode of action.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Premarket review</E> includes the examination of data and information in an application for premarket review described in sections 505, 510(k), 513(f), 515, or 520(g) or 520(l) of the act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act of data and information contained in any investigational new drug (IND) application, investigational device exemption (IDE), new drug application (NDA), biologics license application, device premarket notification, device reclassification petition, and premarket approval application (PMA).</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Primary mode of action</E> is the single mode of action of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The most important therapeutic action is the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Product</E> means any article that contains any drug as defined in section 201(g)(1) of the act; any device as defined in section 201(h) of the act; or any biologic as defined in section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Product jurisdiction officer</E> is the person or persons responsible for designating the component of FDA with primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination product or any product requiring a jurisdictional designation under this part.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Sponsor</E> means “applicant” (see § 3.2(c)).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Designated agency component.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To designate the agency component with primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination product, the agency shall determine the primary mode of action of the product. Where the primary mode of action is that of:</P>
              <P>(1) A drug (other than a biological product), the agency component charged with premarket review of drugs shall have primary jurisdiction;</P>
              <P>(2) A device, the agency component charged with premarket review of devices shall have primary jurisdiction;</P>
              <P>(3) A biological product, the agency component charged with premarket review of biological products shall have primary jurisdiction.</P>

              <P>(b) In some situations, it is not possible to determine, with reasonable certainty, which one mode of action will provide a greater contribution than any other mode of action to the overall therapeutic effects of the combination product. In such a case, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency component that regulates other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. When there are no other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency component with the most expertise related to the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by the combination product.<PRTPAGE P="131"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) The designation of one agency component as having primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination product does not preclude consultations by that component with other agency components or, in appropriate cases, the requirement by FDA of separate applications.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recall policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Recall is an effective method of removing or correcting consumer products that are in violation of laws administered by the Food and Drug Administration. Recall is a voluntary action that takes place because manufacturers and distributors carry out their responsibility to protect the public health and well-being from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception or are otherwise defective. This section and §§ 7.41 through 7.59 recognize the voluntary nature of recall by providing guidance so that responsible firms may effectively discharge their recall responsibilities. These sections also recognize that recall is an alternative to a Food and Drug Administration-initiated court action for removing or correcting violative, distributed products by setting forth specific recall procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to monitor recalls and assess the adequacy of a firm's efforts in recall.</P>
              <P>(b) Recall may be undertaken voluntarily and at any time by manufacturers and distributors, or at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. A request by the Food and Drug Administration that a firm recall a product is reserved for urgent situations and is to be directed to the firm that has primary responsibility for the manufacture and marketing of the product that is to be recalled.</P>
              <P>(c) Recall is generally more appropriate and affords better protection for consumers than seizure, when many lots of product have been widely distributed. Seizure, multiple seizure, or other court action is indicated when a firm refuses to undertake a recall requested by the Food and Drug Administration, or where the agency has reason to believe that a recall would not be effective, determines that a recall is ineffective, or discovers that a violation is continuing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health hazard evaluation and recall classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An evaluation of the health hazard presented by a product being recalled or considered for recall will be conducted by an ad hoc committee of Food and Drug Administration scientists and will take into account, but need not be limited to, the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether any disease or injuries have already occurred from the use of the product.</P>
              <P>(2) Whether any existing conditions could contribute to a clinical situation that could expose humans or animals to a health hazard. Any conclusion shall be supported as completely as possible by scientific documentation and/or statements that the conclusion is the opinion of the individual(s) making the health hazard determination.</P>

              <P>(3) Assessment of hazard to various segments of the population, e.g., children, surgical patients, pets, livestock, <PRTPAGE P="154"/>etc., who are expected to be exposed to the product being considered, with particular attention paid to the hazard to those individuals who may be at greatest risk.</P>
              <P>(4) Assessment of the degree of seriousness of the health hazard to which the populations at risk would be exposed.</P>
              <P>(5) Assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard.</P>
              <P>(6) Assessment of the consequences (immediate or long-range) of occurrence of the hazard.</P>
              <P>(b) On the basis of this determination, the Food and Drug Administration will assign the recall a classification, i.e., Class I, Class II, or Class III, to indicate the relative degree of health hazard of the product being recalled or considered for recall.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recall strategy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A recall strategy that takes into account the following factors will be developed by the agency for a Food and Drug Administration-requested recall and by the recalling firm for a firm-initiated recall to suit the individual circumstances of the particular recall:</P>
              <P>(i) Results of health hazard evaluation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Ease in identifying the product.</P>
              <P>(iii) Degree to which the product's deficiency is obvious to the consumer or user.</P>
              <P>(iv) Degree to which the product remains unused in the market-place.</P>
              <P>(v) Continued availability of essential products.</P>
              <P>(2) The Food and Drug Administration will review the adequacy of a proposed recall strategy developed by a recalling firm and recommend changes as appropriate. A recalling firm should conduct the recall in accordance with an approved recall strategy but need not delay initiation of a recall pending review of its recall strategy.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Elements of a recall strategy.</E> A recall strategy will address the following elements regarding the conduct of the recall:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Depth of recall.</E> Depending on the product's degree of hazard and extent of distribution, the recall strategy will specify the level in the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Consumer or user level, which may vary with product, including any intermediate wholesale or retail level; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Retail level, including any intermediate wholesale level; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Wholesale level.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Public warning.</E> The purpose of a public warning is to alert the public that a product being recalled presents a serious hazard to health. It is reserved for urgent situations where other means for preventing use of the recalled product appear inadequate. The Food and Drug Administration in consultation with the recalling firm will ordinarily issue such publicity. The recalling firm that decides to issue its own public warning is requested to submit its proposed public warning and plan for distribution of the warning for review and comment by the Food and Drug Administration. The recall strategy will specify whether a public warning is needed and whether it will issue as:</P>
              <P>(i) General public warning through the general news media, either national or local as appropriate, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Public warning through specialized news media, e.g., professional or trade press, or to specific segments of the population such as physicians, hospitals, etc.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effectiveness checks.</E> The purpose of effectiveness checks is to verify that all consignees at the recall depth specified by the strategy have received notification about the recall and have taken appropriate action. The method for contacting consignees may be accomplished by personal visits, telephone calls, letters, or a combination thereof. A guide entitled “Methods for Conducting Recall Effectiveness Checks” that describes the use of these different methods is available upon request from the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The recalling firm will ordinarily be responsible for conducting effectiveness checks, but the Food and Drug Administration will assist in this task where necessary and appropriate. The recall strategy will specify the method(s) to be used for <PRTPAGE P="155"/>and the level of effectiveness checks that will be conducted, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Level A—100 percent of the total number of consignees to be contacted;</P>
              <P>(ii) Level B—Some percentage of the total number of consignees to be contacted, which percentage is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, but is greater that 10 percent and less than 100 percent of the total number of consignees;</P>
              <P>(iii) Level C—10 percent of the total number of consignees to be contacted;</P>
              <P>(iv) Level D—2 percent of the total number of consignees to be contacted; or</P>
              <P>(v) Level E—No effectiveness checks.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Food and Drug Administration-requested recall.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or designee may request a firm to initiate a recall when the following determinations have been made:</P>
              <P>(1) That a product that has been distributed presents a risk of illness or injury or gross consumer deception.</P>
              <P>(2) That the firm has not initiated a recall of the product.</P>
              <P>(3) That an agency action is necessary to protect the public health and welfare.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner or his designee will notify the firm of this determination and of the need to begin immediately a recall of the product. Such notification will be by letter or telegram to a responsible official of the firm, but may be preceded by oral communication or by a visit from an authorized representative of the local Food and Drug Administration district office, with formal, written confirmation from the Commissioner or his designee afterward. The notification will specify the violation, the health hazard classification of the violative product, the recall strategy, and other appropriate instructions for conducting the recall.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon receipt of a request to recall, the firm may be asked to provide the Food and Drug Administration any or all of the information listed in § 7.46(a). The firm, upon agreeing to the recall request, may also provide other information relevant to the agency's determination of the need for the recall or how the recall should be conducted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Firm-initiated recall.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A firm may decide of its own volition and under any circumstances to remove or correct a distributed product. A firm that does so because it believes the product to be violative is requested to notify immediately the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office listed in § 5.115 of this chapter. Such removal or correction will be considered a recall only if the Food and Drug Administration regards the product as involving a violation that is subject to legal action, e.g., seizure. In such cases, the firm will be asked to provide the Food and Drug Administration the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Identity of the product involved.</P>
              <P>(2) Reason for the removal or correction and the date and circumstances under which the product deficiency or possible deficiency was discovered.</P>
              <P>(3) Evaluation of the risk associated with the deficiency or possible deficiency.</P>
              <P>(4) Total amount of such products produced and/or the timespan of the production.</P>
              <P>(5) Total amount of such products estimated to be in distribution channels.</P>
              <P>(6) Distribution information, including the number of direct accounts and, where necessary, the identity of the direct accounts.</P>
              <P>(7) A copy of the firm's recall communication if any has issued, or a proposed communication if none has issued.</P>
              <P>(8) Proposed strategy for conducting the recall.</P>
              <P>(9) Name and telephone number of the firm official who should be contacted concerning the recall.</P>

              <P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration will review the information submitted, advise the firm of the assigned recall classification, recommend any appropriate changes in the firm's strategy for the recall, and advise the firm that its recall will be placed in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report. <PRTPAGE P="156"/>Pending this review, the firm need not delay initiation of its product removal or correction.</P>
              <P>(c) A firm may decide to recall a product when informed by the Food and Drug Administration that the agency has determined that the product in question violates the law, but the agency has not specifically requested a recall. The firm's action also is considered a firm-initiated recall and is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) A firm that initiates a removal or correction of its product which the firm believes is a market withdrawal should consult with the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office when the reason for the removal or correction is not obvious or clearly understood but where it is apparent, e.g., because of complaints or adverse reactions regarding the product, that the product is deficient in some respect. In such cases, the Food and Drug Administration will assist the firm in determining the exact nature of the problem.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recall communications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A recalling firm is responsible for promptly notifying each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format, content, and extent of a recall communication should be commensurate with the hazard of the product being recalled and the strategy developed for that recall. In general terms, the purpose of a recall communication is to convey:</P>
              <P>(1) That the product in question is subject to a recall.</P>
              <P>(2) That further distribution or use of any remaining product should cease immediately.</P>
              <P>(3) Where appropriate, that the direct account should in turn notify its customers who received the product about the recall.</P>
              <P>(4) Instructions regarding what to do with the product.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Implementation.</E> A recall communication can be accomplished by telegrams, mailgrams, or first class letters conspicuously marked, preferably in bold red type, on the letter and the envelope: <E T="04">“drug</E> [or <E T="04">food, biologic,</E> etc.] <E T="04">recall</E> [or <E T="04">correction]”.</E> The letter and the envelope should be also marked: <E T="04">“urgent”</E> for class I and class II recalls and, when appropriate, for class III recalls. Telephone calls or other personal contacts should ordinarily be confirmed by one of the above methods and/or documented in an appropriate manner.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents.</E> (1) A recall communication should be written in accordance with the following guidelines:</P>
              <P>(i) Be brief and to the point;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify clearly the product, size, lot number(s), code(s) or serial number(s) and any other pertinent descriptive information to enable accurate and immediate identification of the product;</P>
              <P>(iii) Explain concisely the reason for the recall and the hazard involved, if any;</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide specific instructions on what should be done with respect to the recalled products; and</P>
              <P>(v) Provide a ready means for the recipient of the communication to report to the recalling firm whether it has any of the product, e.g., by sending a postage-paid, self-addressed postcard or by allowing the recipient to place a collect call to the recalling firm.</P>
              <P>(2) The recall communication should not contain irrelevant qualifications, promotional materials, or any other statement that may detract from the message. Where necessary, followup communications should be sent to those who fail to respond to the initial recall communication.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibility of recipient.</E> Consignees that receive a recall communication should immediately carry out the instructions set forth by the recalling firm and, where necessary, extend the recall to its consignees in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>The Food and Drug Administration will promptly make available to the public in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report a descriptive listing of each new recall according to its classification, whether it was Food and Drug Administration-requested or firm-initiated, and the specific action being taken by the recalling firm. The Food and Drug Administration will intentionally delay public notification of recalls of <PRTPAGE P="157"/>certain drugs and devices where the agency determines that public notification may cause unnecessary and harmful anxiety in patients and that initial consultation between patients and their physicians is essential. The report will not include a firm's product removals or corrections which the agency determines to be market withdrawals or stock recoveries. The report, which also includes other Food and Drug Administration regulatory actions, e.g., seizures that were effected and injunctions and prosecutions that were filed, is available upon request from the Office of Public Affairs (HFI-1), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recall status reports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The recalling firm is requested to submit periodic recall status reports to the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office so that the agency may assess the progress of the recall. The frequency of such reports will be determined by the relative urgency of the recall and will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration in each recall case; generally the reporting interval will be between 2 and 4 weeks.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise specified or inappropriate in a given recall case, the recall status report should contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Number of consignees notified of the recall, and date and method of notification.</P>
              <P>(2) Number of consignees responding to the recall communication and quatity of products on hand at the time it was received.</P>
              <P>(3) Number of consignees that did not respond (if needed, the identity of nonresponding consignees may be requested by the Food and Drug Administration).</P>

              <P>(5) Number and results of effectiveness checks that were made.</P>
              <P>(6) Estimated time frames for completion of the recall.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Termination of a recall.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A recall will be terminated when the Food and Drug Administration determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to remove or correct the product in accordance with the recall strategy, and when it is reasonable to assume that the product subject to the recall has been removed and proper disposition or correction has been made commensurate with the degree of hazard of the recalled product. Written notification that a recall is terminated will be issued by the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office to the recalling firm.</P>
              <P>(b) A recalling firm may request termination of its recall by submitting a written request to the appropriate Food and Drug Adminstration district office stating that the recall is effective in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and by accompanying the request with the most current recall status report and a description of the disposition of the recalled product.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General industry guidance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A recall can be disruptive of a firm's operation and business, but there are several steps a prudent firm can take in advance to minimize this disruptive effect. Notwithstanding similar specific requirements for certain products in other parts of this chapter, the following is provided by the Food and Drug Administration as guidance for a firm's consideration:</P>
              <P>(a) Prepare and maintain a current written contingency plan for use in initiating and effecting a recall in accordance with §§ 7.40 through 7.49, 7.53, and 7.55.</P>
              <P>(b) Use sufficient coding of regulated products to make possible positive lot identification and to facilitate effective recall of all violative lots.</P>

              <P>(c) Maintain such product distribution records as are necessary to facilitate location of products that are being recalled. Such records should be maintained for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life and expected use of the product and is at least the length of <PRTPAGE P="158"/>time specified in other applicable regulations concerning records retention.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, a person against whom criminal prosecution under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is contemplated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall be given appropriate notice and an opportunity to present information and views to show cause why criminal prosecution should not be recommended to a United States attorney.</P>
              <P>(2) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Commissioner has reason to believe that they may result in the alteration or destruction of evidence or in the prospective defendant's fleeing to avoid prosecution.</P>
              <P>(3) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Commissioner contemplates recommending further investigation by the Department of Justice.</P>
              <P>(b) If a statute enforced by the Commissioner does not contain a provision for an opportunity to present views, the Commissioner need not, but may in the Commissioner's discretion, provide notice and an opportunity to present views.</P>
              <P>(c) If an apparent violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also constitutes a violation of any other Federal statute(s), and the Commissioner contemplates recommending prosecution under such other statute(s) as well, the notice of opportunity to present views will include all violations.</P>
              <P>(d) Notice of an opportunity to present views may be by letter, standard form, or other document(s) identifying the products and/or conduct alleged to violate the law. The notice shall—</P>
              <P>(1) Be sent by registered or certified mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any other appropriate mode of written communication;</P>
              <P>(2) Specify the time and place where those named may present their views;</P>
              <P>(3) Summarize the violations that constitute the basis of the contemplated prosecution;</P>
              <P>(4) Describe the purpose and procedure of the presentation; and</P>
              <P>(5) Furnish a form on which the legal status of any person named in the notice may be designated.</P>
              <P>(e) If more than one person is named in a notice, a separate opportunity for presentation of views shall be scheduled on request. Otherwise, the time and place specified in a notice may be changed only upon a showing of reasonable grounds. A request for any change shall be addressed to the Food and Drug Administration office that issued the notice and shall be received in that office at least 3 working days before the date set in the notice.</P>
              <P>(f) A person who has received a notice is under no legal obligation to appear or answer in any manner. A person choosing to respond may appear personally, with or without a representative, or may designate a representative to appear for him or her. Alternatively, a person may respond in writing. If a person elects not to respond on or before the time scheduled, the Commissioner will, without further notice, decide whether to recommend criminal prosecution to a United States attorney on the basis of the information available.</P>
              <P>(g) If a respondent chooses to appear solely by designated representative, that representative shall present a signed statement of authorization. If a representative appears for more than one respondent, the representative shall submit independent documentation of authority to act for each respondent. If a representative appears without written authorization, the opportunity to present views with respect to that respondent may be provided at that time only if the authenticity of the representative's authority is first verified by telephone or other appropriate means.</P>

              <P>(a) The presentation of views shall be heard by a designated Food and Drug Administration employee. Other Food <PRTPAGE P="159"/>and Drug Administration employees may be present.</P>
              <P>(b) A presentation of views shall not be open to the public. The agency employee designated to receive views will permit participation of other persons only if they appear with the respondent or the respondent's designated representative, and at the request of, and on behalf of, the respondent.</P>
              <P>(c) A respondent may present any information of any kind bearing on the Commissioner's determination to recommend prosecution. Information may include statements of persons appearing on the respondent's behalf, letters, documents, laboratory analyses, if applicable, or other relevant information or arguments. The opportunity to present views shall be informal. The rules of evidence shall not apply. Any information given by a respondent, including statements by the respondent, shall become part of the agency's records concerning the matter and may be used for any official purpose. The Food and Drug Administration is under no obligation to present evidence or witnesses.</P>
              <P>(d) If the respondent holds a “guaranty or undertaking” as described in section 303(c) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)) that is applicable to the notice, that document, or a verified copy of it, may be presented by the respondent.</P>
              <P>(e) A respondent may have an oral presentation recorded and transcribed at his or her expense, in which case a copy of the transcription shall be furnished to the Food and Drug Administration office from which the notice issued. The employee designated to receive views may order a presentation of views recorded and transcribed at agency expense, in which case a copy of such transcription shall be provided to each respondent.</P>
              <P>(f) If an oral presentation is not recorded and transcribed, the agency employee designated to receive views shall dictate a written summary of the presentation. A copy of the summary shall be provided to each respondent.</P>
              <P>(g) A respondent may comment on the summary or may supplement any response by additional written or documentary evidence. Any comment or addition shall be furnished to the Food and Drug Administration office where the respondent's views were presented. If materials are submitted within 10 calendar days after receipt of the copy of the summary or transcription of the presentation, as applicable, they will be considered before a final decision as to whether or not to recommend prosecution. Any materials received after the supplemental response period generally will be considered only if the final agency decision has not yet been made.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) When consideration of a criminal prosecution recommendation involving the same violations is closed by the Commissioner with respect to all persons named in the notice, the Commissioner will so notify each person in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) When it is determined that a person named in a notice will not be included in the Commissioner's recommendation for criminal prosecution, the Commissioner will so notify that person, if and when the Commissioner concludes that notification will not prejudice the prosecution of any other person.</P>
              <P>(3) When a United States attorney informs the agency that no persons recommended will be prosecuted, the Commissioner will so notify each person in writing, unless the United States attorney has already done so.</P>
              <P>(4) When a United States attorney informs the agency of intent to prosecute some, but not all, persons who had been provided an opportunity to present views and were subsequently named in the Commissioner's recommendation for criminal prosecution, the Commissioner, after being advised by the United States attorney that the notification will not prejudice the prosecution of any other person, will so notify those persons eliminated from further consideration, unless the United States attorney has already done so.</P>

              <P>(a) Records related to a section 305 opportunity for presentation of views constitute investigatory records for <PRTPAGE P="160"/>law enforcement purposes and may include inter- and intra-agency memorandums.</P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding the rule established in § 20.21 of this chapter, no record related to a section 305 presentation is available for public disclosure until consideration of criminal prosecution has been closed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in § 20.82 of this chapter. Only very rarely and only under circumstances that demonstrate a compelling public interest will the Commissioner exercise, in accordance with § 20.82 of this chapter, the authorized discretion to disclose records related to a section 305 presentation before the consideration of criminal prosecution is closed.</P>
              <P>(2) After consideration of criminal prosecution is closed, the records are available for public disclosure in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, except to the extent that the exemptions from disclosure in subpart D of part 20 of this chapter are applicable. No statements obtained through promises of confidentiality shall be available for public disclosure.</P>
              <P>(b) Consideration of criminal prosecution based on a particular section 305 notice of opportunity for presentation of views shall be deemed to be closed within the meaning of this section and § 7.85 when a final decision has been made not to recommend criminal prosecution to a United States attorney based on charges set forth in the notice and considered at the presentation, or when such a recommendation has been finally refused by the United States attorney, or when criminal prosecution has been instituted and the matter and all related appeals have been concluded, or when the statute of limitations has run.</P>
              <P>(c) Before disclosure of any record specifically reflecting consideration of a possible recommendation for criminal prosecution of any individual, all names and other information that would identify an individual whose prosecution was considered but not recommended, or who was not prosecuted, shall be deleted, unless the Commissioner concludes that there is a compelling public interest in the disclosure of the names.</P>
              <P>(d) Names and other information that would identify a Food and Drug Administration employee shall be deleted from records related to a section 305 presentation of views before public disclosure only under § 20.32 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initiation of administrative proceedings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>An administrative proceeding may be initiated in the following three ways:</P>
              <P>(a) An interested person may petition the Commissioner to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or to take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action. A petition must be either:</P>
              <P>(1) In the form specified in other applicable FDA regulations, e.g., the form for a color additive petition in § 71.1, for a food additive petition in § 171.1, for a new drug application in § 314.50, for a new animal drug application in § 514.1, or</P>
              <P>(2) in the form for a citizen petition in § 10.30.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner may initiate a proceeding to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order or take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action. FDA has primary jurisdiction to make the initial determination on issues within its statutory mandate, and will request a court to dismiss, or to hold in abeyance its determination of or refer to the agency for administrative determination, any issue which has not previously been determined by the agency or which, if it has previously been determined, the agency concluded should be reconsidered and subject to a new administrative determination. The Commissioner may utilize any of the procedures established in this part in reviewing and making a determination on any matter initiated under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(c) The Commissioner will institute a proceeding to determine whether to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action whenever any court, on its own initiative, holds in abeyance or refers any matter to the agency for an administrative determination and the Commissioner concludes that an administrative determination is feasible within agency priorities and resources.</P>

              <P>(c) A petition that appears to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 10.20, and, if applicable, § 10.31, will be filed by the Division of Dockets Management, stamped with the date of filing, and assigned a unique docket number. The unique docket number identifies the docket file established by the Division of Dockets Management for all submissions relating to the petition, as provided in this part. Subsequent submissions relating to the matter must refer <PRTPAGE P="167"/>to the assigned docket number assigned in this paragraph and will be filed in the established docket file. Related petitions may be filed together and given the same docket number. The Division of Dockets Management will promptly notify the petitioner of the filing and unique docket number of the petition.</P>
              <P>(d) An interested person may submit comments to the Division of Dockets Management on a filed petition, which comments become part of the docket file. The comments are to specify the docket number of the petition and include, if applicable, the verification under § 10.31, and may support or oppose the petition in whole or in part. A request for alternative or different administrative action must be submitted as a separate petition.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) The Commissioner shall, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), rule upon each petition filed under paragraph (c) of this section, taking into consideration (i) available agency resources for the category of subject matter, (ii) the priority assigned to the petition considering both the category of subject matter involved and the overall work of the agency, and (iii) time requirements established by statute.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4) and (5) of this section, the Commissioner shall furnish a response to each petitioner within 180 days of receipt of the petition. The response will either:</P>

              <P>(i) Approve the petition, in which case the Commissioner shall concurrently take appropriate action (e.g., publication of a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice) implementing the approval;</P>
              <P>(ii) Deny the petition;</P>
              <P>(iii) Dismiss the petition if at any time the Commissioner determines that changes in law, facts, or circumstances since the date on which the petition was submitted have rendered the petition moot; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide a tentative response, indicating why the agency has been unable to reach a decision on the petition, e.g., because of the existence of other agency priorities, or a need for additional information. The tentative response may also indicate the likely ultimate agency response, and may specify when a final response may be furnished.</P>

              <P>(3) The Commissioner may grant or deny such a petition, in whole or in part, and may grant such other relief or take other action as the petition warrants. If, at any time, the Commissioner determines that changes in law, facts, or circumstances since the date on which the petition was submitted have rendered the petition moot, the Commissioner may dismiss the petition. The petitioner is to be notified of the Commissioner's decision. The decision will be placed in the public docket file and may also be in the form of a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The Commissioner shall furnish a response to each petitioner within 90 days of receipt of a petition filed under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act. The response will either approve or disapprove the petition. Agency action on a petition shall be governed by § 314.93 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(5) The Commissioner intends to furnish a response to each petitioner within 150 days of receipt of a petition subject to section 505(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(f) If a petition filed under paragraph (c) of this section requests the Commissioner to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation, § 10.40 or § 10.50 also apply.</P>
              <P>(g) A petitioner may supplement, amend, or withdraw a petition without Agency approval and without prejudice to resubmission at any time until the Commissioner rules on the petition, unless the petition has been referred for a hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, or 15 of this chapter. After a ruling or referral, a petition may be supplemented, amended, or withdrawn only with the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may approve withdrawal, with or without prejudice against resubmission of the petition.</P>
              <P>(h) In reviewing a petition the Commissioner may use the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under § 10.65.</P>
              <P>(2) A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.</P>
              <P>(3) A <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice requesting information and views.<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A proposal to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation, in accordance with § 10.40 or § 12.20.</P>
              <P>(5) Any other specific public procedure established in this chapter and expressly applicable to the matter.</P>
              <P>(i) The record of the administrative proceeding consists of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The petition, including all information on which it relies, filed by the Division of Dockets Management.</P>
              <P>(2) All comments received on the petition, including all information submitted as a part of the comments.</P>
              <P>(3) If the petition resulted in a proposal to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation, all of the documents specified in § 10.40(g).</P>

              <P>(4) The record, consisting of any transcripts, minutes of meetings, reports, <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notices, and other documents resulting from the optional procedures specified in paragraph (h) of this section, except a transcript of a closed portion of a public advisory committee meeting.</P>
              <P>(5) The Commissioner's decision on the petition, including all information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the Division of Dockets Management as part of the record supporting the decision.</P>
              <P>(6) All documents filed with the Division of Dockets Management under § 10.65(h).</P>
              <P>(7) If a petition for reconsideration or for a stay of action is filed under paragraph (j) of this section, the administrative record specified in § 10.33(k) or § 10.35(h).</P>
              <P>(j) The administrative record specified in paragraph (i) of this section is the exclusive record for the Commissioner's decision. The record of the administrative proceeding closes on the date of the Commissioner's decision unless some other date is specified. Thereafter any interested person may submit a petition for reconsideration under § 10.33 or a petition for stay of action under § 10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the decision in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(k) This section does not apply to the referral of a matter to a United States attorney for the initiation of court enforcement action and related correspondence, or to requests, suggestions, and recommendations made informally in routine correspondence received by FDA. Routine correspondence does not constitute a petition within the meaning of this section unless it purports to meet the requirements of this section. Action on routine correspondence does not constitute final administrative action subject to judicial review under § 10.45.</P>
              <P>(l) The Division of Dockets Management will maintain a chronological list of each petition filed under this section and § 10.85, but not of petitions submitted elsewhere in the agency under § 10.25(a)(1), showing:</P>
              <P>(1) The docket number;</P>
              <P>(2) The date the petition was filed by the Division of Dockets Management;</P>
              <P>(3) The name of the petitioner;</P>
              <P>(4) The subject matter involved; and</P>

              <P>(c) A petition for reconsideration relating to a petition submitted under § 10.25(a)(2) is subject to the requirements of § 10.30 (c) and (d), except that it is filed in the same docket file as the petition to which it relates.</P>
              <P>(d) The Commissioner shall promptly review a petition for reconsideration. The Commissioner may grant the petition when the Commissioner determines it is in the public interest and in the interest of justice. The Commissioner shall grant a petition for reconsideration in any proceeding if the Commissioner determines all of the following apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The petition demonstrates that relevant information or views contained in the administrative record were not previously or not adequately considered.</P>
              <P>(2) The petitioner's position is not frivolous and is being pursued in good faith.</P>
              <P>(3) The petitioner has demonstrated sound public policy grounds supporting reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(4) Reconsideration is not outweighed by public health or other public interests.</P>

              </P>

              <P>(g) The Commissioner may consider a petition for reconsideration only before the petitioner brings legal action in the courts to review the action, except that a petition may also be considered if the Commissioner has denied a petition for stay of action and the petitioner has petitioned for judicial review of the Commissioner's action and requested the reviewing court to grant a stay pending consideration of review. <PRTPAGE P="171"/>A petition for reconsideration submitted later than 30 days after the date of the decision involved will be denied as untimely unless the Commissioner permits the petition to be filed after 30 days. A petition for reconsideration will be considered as submitted on the day it is received by the Division of Dockets Management.</P>
              <P>(h) The Commissioner may initiate the reconsideration of all or part of a matter at any time after it has been decided or action has been taken.

The administrative record of the proceeding is to include all additional documents relating to such reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(i) After determining to reconsider a matter, the Commissioner shall review and rule on the merits of the matter under § 10.30(e). The Commissioner may reaffirm, modify, or overrule the prior decision, in whole or in part, and may grant such other relief or take such other action as is warranted.</P>
              <P>(j) The Commissioner's reconsideration of a matter relating to a petition submitted under § 10.25(a)(2) is subject to § 10.30 (f) through (h), (j), and (k).</P>

              <P>(c) A petition for stay of action relating to a petition submitted under § 10.25(a)(2) is subject to the requirements of § 10.30 (c) and (d), except that it will be filed in the same docket file as the petition to which it relates.</P>
              <P>(d) Neither the filing of a petition for a stay of action nor action taken by an interested person in accordance with any other administrative procedure in this part or in any other section of this chapter, e.g., the filing of a citizen petition under § 10.30 or a petition for reconsideration under § 10.33 or a request for an advisory opinion under § 10.85, will stay or otherwise delay any administrative action by the Commissioner, including enforcement action of any kind, unless one of the following applies:</P>

If, at any time, the Commissioner determines that changes in law, facts, or circumstances since the date on which the petition was submitted have rendered the petition moot, the Commissioner may dismiss the petition. The Commissioner may grant a stay in any proceeding if it is in the public interest and in the interest of justice. The Commissioner shall grant a stay in any proceeding if all of the following apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The petitioner will otherwise suffer irreparable injury.</P>
              <P>(2) The petitioner's case is not frivolous and is being pursued in good faith.</P>
              <P>(3) The petitioner has demonstrated sound public policy grounds supporting the stay.</P>

              <P>(f) The Commissioner's decision on a petition for stay of action is to be in writing and placed on public display as part of the file on the matter in the office of the Division of Dockets Management. A determination to grant a stay will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> if the Commissioner's original decision was so published. Any other determination to grant or to deny a stay may also be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(g) A petition for a stay of action submitted later than 30 days after the date of the decision involved will be denied as untimely unless the Commissioner permits the petition to be filed after 30 days. A petition for a stay of action is considered submitted on the day it is received by the Division of Dockets Management.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Promulgation of regulations for the efficient enforcement of the law.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commissioner may propose and promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of the laws administered by FDA whenever it is necessary or appropriate to do so. The issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation may be initiated in any of the ways specified in § 10.25.</P>
              <P>(1) This section applies to any regulation: (i) Not subject to § 10.50 and part 12, or (ii) if it is subject to § 10.50 and part 12, to the extent that those provisions make this section applicable.</P>

              <P>(2) A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition submitted under § 10.25(a) will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a proposal if:</P>
              <P>(i) The petition contains facts demonstrating reasonable grounds for the proposal; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The petition substantially shows that the proposal is in the public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the agency.</P>
              <P>(3) Two or more alternative proposed regulations may be published on the same subject to obtain comment on the different alternatives.</P>
              <P>(4) A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition submitted under § 10.25(a) may be published together with the Commissioner's preliminary views on the proposal and any alternative proposal.</P>

              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each regulation must be the subject of a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> (1) The notice will contain:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of the agency;</P>
              <P>(ii) The nature of the action, e.g., proposed rule, or notice;</P>
              <P>(iii) A summary in the first paragraph describing the substance of the document in easily understandable terms;</P>
              <P>(iv) Relevant dates, e.g., comment closing date, and proposed effective date(s);</P>
              <P>(v) The name, business address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can provide further information to the public about the notice;</P>
              <P>(vi) An address for submitting written comments;</P>
              <P>(vii) Supplementary information about the notice in the form of a preamble that summarizes the proposal and the facts and policy underlying it, includes references to all information on which the Commissioner relies for the proposal (copies or a full list of which are a part of the docket file on the matter in the office of the Division of Dockets Management), and cites the authority under which the regulation is proposed;</P>
              <P>(viii) Either the terms or substance of the proposed regulation or a description of the subjects and issues involved;</P>
              <P>(ix) A reference to the existence or lack of need for an environmental impact statement under § 25.52 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(x) The docket number of the matter, which identifies the docket file established by the Division of Dockets Management for all relevant submissions.</P>
              <P>(2) The proposal will provide 60 days for comment, although the Commissioner may shorten or lengthen this time period for good cause. In no event is the time for comment to be less than 10 days.</P>
              <P>(3) After publication of the proposed rule, any interested person may request the Commissioner to extend the comment period for an additional specified period by submitting a written request to the Division of Dockets Management stating the grounds for the request. The request is submitted under § 10.35 but should be headed “REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD.”</P>

              <P>(i) A request must discuss the reason comments could not feasibly be submitted within the time permitted, or <PRTPAGE P="174"/>that important new information will shortly be available, or that sound public policy otherwise supports an extension of the time for comment. The Commissioner may grant or deny the request or may grant an extension for a time period different from that requested. An extension may be limited to specific persons who have made and justified the request, but will ordinarily apply to all interested persons.</P>

              <P>(ii) A comment time extension of 30 days or longer will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and will be applicable to all interested persons. A comment time extension of less than 30 days will be the subject either of a letter or memorandum filed with the Division of Dockets Management or of a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A notice of proposed rulemaking will request that four copies of all comments be submitted to the Division of Dockets Management, except that individuals may submit single copies. Comments will be stamped with the date of receipt and will be numbered chronologically.</P>
              <P>(5) Persons submitting comments critical of a proposed regulation are encouraged to include their preferred alternative wording.</P>

              <P>(c) After the time for comment on a proposed regulation has expired, the Commissioner will review the entire administrative record on the matter, including all comments and, in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> will terminate the proceeding, issue a new proposal, or promulgate a final regulation.</P>
              <P>(1) The quality and persuasiveness of the comments will be the basis for the Commissioner's decision. The number or length of comments will not ordinarily be a significant factor in the decision unless the number of comments is material where the degree of public interest is a legitimate factor for consideration.</P>
              <P>(2) The decision of the Commissioner on the matter will be based solely upon the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(3) A final regulation published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> will have a preamble stating: (i) The name of the agency, (ii) the nature of the action e.g., final rule, notice, (iii) a summary first paragraph describing the substance of the document in easily understandable terms, (iv) relevant dates, e.g., the rule's effective date and comment closing date, if an opportunity for comment is provided, (v) the name, business address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can provide further information to the public about the notice, (vi) an address for the submission of written comments when they are permitted, (vii) supplementary information about the regulation in the body of the preamble that contains references to prior notices relating to the same matter and a summary of each type of comment submitted on the proposal and the Commissioner's conclusions with respect to each. The preamble is to contain a thorough and comprehensible explanation of the reasons for the Commissioner's decision on each issue.</P>

              <P>(4) The effective date of a final regulation may not be less than 30 days after the date of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> except for:</P>
              <P>(i) A regulation that grants an exemption or relieves a restriction; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A regulation for which the Commissioner finds, and states in the notice good cause for an earlier effective date.</P>
              <P>(d) The provisions for notice and comment in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply only to the extent required by the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, 552, and 553). As a matter of discretion, however, the Commissioner may voluntarily follow those provisions in circumstances in which they are not required by the Administrative Procedure Act.</P>
              <P>(e) The requirements of notice and public procedure in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply in the following situations:</P>

              <P>(1) When the Commissioner determines for good cause that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. In these cases, the notice promulgating the regulation will state the reasons for the determination, and provide an opportunity for comment to determine whether the regulation should subsequently be modified or revoked. A subsequent notice based on those comments may, but <PRTPAGE P="175"/>need not, provide additional opportunity for public comment.</P>
              <P>(2) Food additive and color additive petitions, which are subject to the provisions of § 12.20(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) New animal drug regulations, which are promulgated under section 512(i) of the act.</P>

              <P>(f) In addition to the notice and public procedure required under paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner may also subject a proposed or final regulation, before or after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> to the following additional procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under § 10.65.</P>
              <P>(2) A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, or 15.</P>
              <P>(3) A notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> requesting information and views before the Commissioner determines whether to propose a regulation.</P>

              <P>(4) A draft of a proposed regulation placed on public display in the office of the Division of Dockets Management. If this procedure is used, the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> stating that the document is available and specifying the time within which comments on the draft proposal may be submitted orally or in writing.</P>
              <P>(5) A revised proposal published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> which proposal is subject to all the provisions in this section relating to proposed regulations.</P>

              <P>(6) A tentative final regulation or tentative revised final regulation placed on public display in the office of the Division of Dockets Management and, if deemed desirable by the Commissioner, published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If the tentative regulation is placed on display only, the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> stating that the document is available and specifying the time within which comments may be submitted orally or in writing on the tentative final regulation. The Commissioner shall mail a copy of the tentative final regulation and the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice to each person who submitted comments on the proposed regulation if one has been published.</P>
              <P>(7) A final regulation published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that provides an opportunity for the submission of further comments, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Any other public procedure established in this chapter and expressly applicable to the matter.</P>
              <P>(g) The record of the administrative proceeding consists of all of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) If the regulation was initiated by a petition, the administrative record specified in § 10.30(i).</P>
              <P>(2) If a petition for reconsideration or for a stay of action is filed, the administrative record specified in §§ 10.33(k) and 10.35(h).</P>
              <P>(3) The proposed rule published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> including all information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the Division of Dockets Management on the proposal.</P>
              <P>(4) All comments received on the proposal, including all information submitted as a part of the comments.</P>
              <P>(5) The notice promulgating the final regulation, including all information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the Division of Dockets Management as part of the administrative record of the final regulation.</P>

A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit it to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the final regulation.</P>

              <P>(i) The Division of Dockets Management shall maintain a chronological list of all regulations proposed and promulgated under this section and § 10.50 <PRTPAGE P="176"/>(which list will not include regulations resulting from petitions filed and assigned a docket number under § 10.30) showing—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Court review of final administrative action; exhaustion of administrative remedies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to court review of final administrative action taken by the Commissioner, including action taken under §§ 10.25 through 10.40 and § 16.1(b), except action subject to § 10.50 and part 12.</P>

              <P>(b) A request that the Commissioner take or refrain from taking any form of administrative action must first be the subject of a final administrative decision based on a petition submitted under § 10.25(a) or, where applicable, a hearing under § 16.1(b) before any legal action is filed in a court complaining of the action or failure to act. If a court action is filed complaining of the action or failure to act before the submission of the decision on a petition under § 10.25(a) or, where applicable, a hearing under § 16.1(b), the Commissioner shall request dismissal of the court action or referral to the agency for an initial administrative determination on the grounds of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the lack of final agency action as required by 5 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and the lack of an actual controversy as required by 28 U.S.C. 2201.</P>

              <P>(c) A request that administrative action be stayed must first be the subject of an administrative decision based upon a petition for stay of action submitted under § 10.35 before a request is made that a court stay the action. If a court action is filed requesting a stay of administrative action before the Commissioner's decision on a petition submitted in a timely manner pursuant to § 10.35, the Commissioner shall request dismissal of the court action or referral to the agency for an initial determination on the grounds of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the lack of final agency action as required by 5 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and the lack of an actual controversy as required by 28 U.S.C. 2201. If a court action is filed requesting a stay of administrative action after a petition for a stay of action is denied because it was submitted after expiration of the time period provided under § 10.35, or after the time for submitting such a petition has expired, the Commissioner will request dismissal of the court action on the ground of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</P>

              <P>(d) Unless otherwise provided, the Commissioner's final decision constitutes final agency action (reviewable in the courts under 5 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and, where appropriate, 28 U.S.C. 2201) on a petition submitted under § 10.25(a), on a petition for reconsideration submitted under § 10.33, on a petition for stay of action submitted under § 10.35, on an advisory opinion issued under § 10.85, on a matter involving administrative action which is the subject of an opportunity for a hearing under § 16.1(b) of this chapter, or on the issuance of a final regulation published in accordance with § 10.40, except that the agency's response to a petition filed under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(C)) and § 314.93 of this chapter will not constitute final agency action until any petition for reconsideration submitted by the petitioner is acted on by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(1) It is the position of FDA except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that:</P>
              <P>(i) Final agency action exhausts all administrative remedies and is ripe for preenforcement judicial review as of the date of the final decision, unless applicable law explicitly requires that the petitioner take further action before judicial review is available;</P>

              <P>(ii) An interested person is affected by, and thus has standing to obtain judicial review of final agency action; and<PRTPAGE P="177"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) It is not appropriate to move to dismiss a suit for preenforcement judicial review of final agency action on the ground that indispenable parties are not joined or that it is an unconsented suit against the United States if the defect could be cured by amending the complaint.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commissioner shall object to judicial review of a matter if:</P>
              <P>(i) The matter is committed by law to the discretion of the Commissioner, e.g., a decision to recommend or not to recommend civil or criminal enforcement action under sections 302, 303, and 304 of the act; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Review is not sought in a proper court.</P>
              <P>(e) An interested person may request judicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner in the courts without first petitioning the Commissioner for reconsideration or for a stay of action, except that in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the person shall request a stay by the Commissioner under § 10.35 before requesting a stay by the court.</P>

              <P>(f) The Commissioner shall take the position in an action for judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> whether or not it includes a request for a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. 2201, or in any other case in which the validity of administrative action is properly challenged, that the validity of the action must be determined solely on the basis of the administrative record specified in §§ 10.30(i), 10.33(k), 10.35(h), 10.40(g), and 16.80(a) or the administrative record applicable to any decision or action under the regulations referenced in § 16.1(b), and that additional information or views may not be considered. An interested person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the action under § 10.25(a).</P>
              <P>(g) The Commissioner requests that all petitions for judicial review of a particular matter be filed in a single U.S. District court. If petitions are filed in more than one jurisdiction, the Commissioner will take appropriate action to prevent a multiplicity of suits in various jurisdictions, such as:</P>
              <P>(1) A request for transfer of one or more suits to consolidate separate actions, under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) or 28 U.S.C. 2112(a);</P>
              <P>(2) A request that actions in all but one jurisdiction be stayed pending the conclusion of one proceeding;</P>
              <P>(3) A request that all but one action be dismissed pending the conclusion of one proceeding, with the suggestion that the other plaintiffs intervene in that one suit; or</P>
              <P>(4) A request that one of the suits be maintained as a class action in behalf of all affected persons.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) For the purpose of 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), a copy of any petition filed in any U.S. Court of Appeals challenging a final action of the Commissioner shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery to the Chief Counsel of FDA. The petition copy shall be time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original is filed with the court. The petition copy should be addressed to: Office of the Chief Counsel (GCF-1), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The Chief Counsel requests that the purpose of all petitions mailed or delivered to the Office of Chief Counsel to satisfy 28 U.S.C. 2112(a) be clearly identified in a cover letter.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Chief Counsel receives two or more petitions filed in two or more U.S. Courts of Appeals for review of any agency action within 10 days of the effective date of that action for the purpose of judicial review, the Chief Counsel will notify the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation of any petitions that were received within the 10-day period, in accordance with the applicable rule of the panel.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of determining whether a petition for review has been received within the 10-day period under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the petition shall be considered to be received on the date of delivery, if personally delivered. If the delivery is accomplished by mail, the date of receipt shall be the date noted on the return receipt card.</P>
              <P>(i) Upon judicial review of administrative action under this section:</P>

              <P>(1) If a court determines that the administrative record is inadequate to <PRTPAGE P="178"/>support the action, the Commissioner shall determine whether to proceed with such action. (i) If the Commissioner decides to proceed with the action, the court will be requested to remand the matter to the agency to reopen the administrative proceeding and record, or on the Commissioner's own initiative the administrative proceeding and record may be reopened upon receipt of the court determination. A reopened administrative proceeding will be conducted under the provisions of this part and in accordance with any directions of the court.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that the public interest requires that the action remain in effect pending further administrative proceedings, the court will be requested not to stay the matter in the interim and the Commissioner shall expedite the further administrative proceedings.</P>
              <P>(2) If a court determines that the administrative record is adequate, but the rationale for the action must be further explained:</P>
              <P>(i) The Commissioner shall request either that further explanation be provided in writing directly to the court without further administrative proceedings, or that the administrative proceeding be reopened in accordance with paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that the public interest requires that the action remain in effect pending further court or administrative proceedings, the court will be requested not to stay the matter in the interim and the Commissioner shall expedite the further proceedings.</P>

              <P>(a) This section applies to any matter subject by statute to an opportunity for a formal evidentiary public hearing, as listed in § 10.50(c), and any matter subject to a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry under part 13.</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a matter listed in § 10.50(c) (1) through (10) and (12) through (15):</P>
              <P>(1) An interested person may meet or correspond with any FDA representative concerning a matter prior to publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry on the matter; the provisions of § 10.65 apply to the meetings and correspondence; and</P>
              <P>(2) Upon publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry, the following separation of functions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The center responsible for the matter is, as a party to the hearing, responsible for all investigative functions and for presentation of the position of the center at the hearing and in any pleading or oral argument before the Commissioner. Representatives of the center may not participate or advise in any decision except as witness or counsel in public proceedings. There is to be no other communication between representatives of the center and representatives of the office of the Commissioner concerning the matter before the decision of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may, however, designate representatives of a center to advise the office of the Commissioner, or designate members of that office to advise a center. The designation will be in writing and filed with the Division of Dockets Management no later than the time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the application of separation of functions. All members of FDA other than representatives of the involved center (except those specifically designated otherwise) shall be available to advise and participate with the office of the Commissioner in its functions relating to the hearing and the final decision.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Chief Counsel for FDA shall designate members of the office of General Counsel to advise and participate with the center in its functions in the hearing and members who are to advise the office of the Commissioner in its functions related to the hearing and the final decision. The members of the office of General Counsel designated to advise the center may not participate or advise in any decision of the Commissioner except as counsel in public proceedings. The designation is to be in the form of a memorandum filed with the Division of Dockets Management and made a part of the administrative record in the proceeding. There may be no other communication between those members of the office of General Counsel designated to advise the office of the Commissioner and any other persons in the office of General Counsel or in the involved center with respect to the matter prior to the decision of the Commissioner. The Chief Counsel may assign new attorneys to advise either the center or the office of the Commissioner at any stage of the proceedings. The Chief Counsel will ordinarily advise and participate with the office of the Commissioner in its functions relating to the hearing and the final decision.</P>

              <P>(iii) The office of the Commissioner is responsible for the agency review and final decision of the matter, with the advice and participation of anyone in FDA other than representatives of <PRTPAGE P="180"/>the involved center and those members of the office of General Counsel designated to assist in the center's functions in the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) In a matter listed in § 10.50(c) (11) and (16) through (19), the provisions relating to separation of functions set forth in §§ 314.200(f), 514.200, and 601.7(a) are applicable before publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry. Following publication of the notice of hearing, the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, between the date that separation of functions applies under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and the date of the Commissioner's decision on the matter, communication concerning the matter involved in the hearing will be restricted as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) No person outside the agency may have an ex parte communication with the presiding officer or any person representing the office of the Commissioner concerning the matter in the hearing. Neither the presiding officer nor any person representing the office of the Commissioner may have any ex parte communication with a person outside the agency concerning the matter in the hearing. All communications are to be public communications, as witness or counsel, under the applicable provisions of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) A participant in the hearing may submit a written communication to the office of the Commissioner with respect to a proposal for settlement. These communications are to be in the form of pleadings, served on all other participants, and filed with the Division of Dockets Management like any other pleading.</P>
              <P>(3) A written communication contrary to this section must be immediately served on all other participants and filed with the Division of Dockets Management by the presiding officer at the hearing, or by the Commissioner, depending on who received the communication. An oral communication contrary to this section must be immediately recorded in a written memorandum and similarly served on all other participants and filed with the Division of Dockets Management. A person, including a representative of a participant in the hearing, who is involved in an oral communication contrary to this section, must, if possible, be made available for cross-examination during the hearing with respect to the substance of that conversation. Rebuttal testimony pertinent to a written or oral communication contrary to this section will be permitted. Cross-examination and rebuttal testimony will be transcribed and filed with the Division of Dockets Management.</P>
              <P>(e) The prohibitions specified in paragraph (d) of this section apply to a person who knows of a notice of hearing in advance of its publication from the time the knowledge is acquired.</P>
              <P>(f) The making of a communication contrary to this section may, consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statute, result in a decision adverse to the person knowingly making or causing the making of such a communication.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meetings and correspondence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In addition to public hearings and proceedings established under this part and other sections of this chapter, meetings may be held and correspondence may be exchanged between representatives of FDA and an interested person outside FDA on a matter within the jurisdiction of the laws administered by the Commissioner. Action on meetings and correspondence does not constitute final administrative action subject to judicial review under § 10.45.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner may conclude that it would be in the public interest to hold an open public meeting to discuss a matter (or class of matters) pending before FDA, in which any interested person may participate.</P>
              <P>(1) The Commissioner shall inform the public of the time and place of the meeting and of the matters to be discussed.</P>
              <P>(2) The meeting will be informal, i.e., any interested person may attend and participate in the discussion without prior notice to the agency unless the notice of the meeting specifies otherwise.</P>
              <P>(c) Every person outside the Federal Government may request a private meeting with a representative of FDA in agency offices to discuss a matter. FDA will make reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests.</P>
              <P>(1) The person requesting a meeting may be accompanied by a reasonable number of employees, consultants, or other persons with whom there is a commercial arrangement within the meaning of § 20.81(a) of this chapter. Neither FDA nor any other person may require the attendance of a person who is not an employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government without the agreement of the person requesting the meeting. Any person may attend by mutual consent of the person requesting the meeting and FDA.</P>
              <P>(2) FDA will determine which representatives of the agency will attend the meeting. The person requesting the meeting may request, but not require or preclude, the attendance of a specific FDA employee.</P>
              <P>(3) A person who wishes to attend a private meeting, but who is not invited to attend either by the person requesting the meeting or by FDA, or who otherwise cannot attend the meeting, may request a separate meeting with FDA to discuss the same matter or an additional matter.</P>
              <P>(d) FDA employees have a responsibility to meet with all segments of the public to promote the objectives of the laws administered by the agency. In pursuing this responsibility, the following general policy applies where agency employees are invited by persons outside the Federal Government to attend or participate in meetings outside agency offices as representatives of the agency.</P>
              <P>(1) A person outside the executive branch may invite an agency representative to attend or participate in a meeting outside agency offices. The agency representative is not obligated to attend or participate, but may do so where it is in the public interest and will promote the objectives of the act.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency representative may request that the meeting be open if that would be in the public interest. The agency representative may decline to participate in a meeting held as a private meeting if that will best serve the public interest.</P>
              <P>(3) An agency representative may not knowingly participate in a meeting that is closed on the basis of gender, race, or religion.</P>
              <P>(e) An official transcript, recording, or memorandum summarizing the substance of any meeting described in this section will be prepared by a representative of FDA when the agency determines that such documentation will be useful.</P>
              <P>(f) FDA promptly will file in the appropriate administrative file memoranda of meetings prepared by FDA representatives and all correspondence, including any written summary of a meeting from a participant, that relate to a matter pending before the agency.</P>

              <P>(g) Representatives of FDA may initiate a meeting or correspondence on any matter concerning the laws administered by the Commissioner. Unless otherwise required by law, meetings <PRTPAGE P="182"/>may be public or private at FDA's discretion.</P>
              <P>(h) A meeting of an advisory committee is subject to the requirements of part 14 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) The recommendations and decisions of individual employees, including supervisory personnel, responsible for handling the matter.</P>
              <P>(i) The recommendations and decisions are to reveal significant controversies or differences of opinion and their resolution.</P>
              <P>(ii) An agency employee working on a matter and, consistent with the prompt completion of other assignments, an agency employee who has worked on a matter may record individual views on that matter in a written memorandum, which is to be placed in the file.</P>
              <P>(c) A written document placed in an administrative file must:</P>
              <P>(1) Relate to the factual, scientific, legal or related issues under consideration;</P>
              <P>(2) Be dated and signed by the author;</P>
              <P>(3) Be directed to the file, to appropriate supervisory personnel, and to other appropriate employees, and show all persons to whom copies were sent;</P>
              <P>(4) Avoid defamatory language, intemperate remarks, undocumented charges, or irrelevant matters (e.g., personnel complaints);</P>
              <P>(5) If it records the views, analyses, recommendations, or decisions of an agency employee in addition to the author, be given to the other employees; and</P>
              <P>(6) Once completed (i.e., typed in final form, dated, and signed) not be altered or removed. Later additions to or revisions of the document must be made in a new document.</P>
              <P>(d) Memoranda or other documents that are prepared by agency employees and are not in the administrative file have no status or effect.</P>
              <P>(e) FDA employees working on a matter have access to the administrative file on that matter, as appropriate for the conduct of their work. FDA employees who have worked on a matter have access to the administrative file on that matter so long as attention to their assignments is not impeded. Reasonable restrictions may be placed upon access to assure proper cataloging and storage of documents, the availability of the file to others, and the completeness of the file for review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Internal agency review of decisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A decision of an FDA employee, other than the Commissioner, on a matter, is subject to review by the employee's supervisor under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) At the request of the employee.</P>
              <P>(2) On the initiative of the supervisor.</P>
              <P>(3) At the request of an interested person outside the agency.</P>
              <P>(4) As required by delegations of authority.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The review will be made by consultation between the employee and the supervisor or by review of the administrative file on the matter, or both. The review will ordinarily follow the established agency channels of supervision or review for that matter.</P>

              <P>(2) A sponsor, applicant, or manufacturer of a drug or device regulated under the act or the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), may request review of a scientific controversy by an appropriate scientific advisory panel as described in section 505(n) of the act, or an advisory committee as described in section 515(g)(2)(B) of the act. The reason(s) for any denial of a request for <PRTPAGE P="183"/>such review shall be briefly set forth in writing to the requester. Persons who receive a Center denial of their request under this section may submit a request for review of the denial. The request should be sent to the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman.</P>
              <P>(c) An interested person outside the agency may request internal agency review of a decision through the established agency channels of supervision or review. Personal review of these matters by center directors or the office of the Commissioner will occur for any of the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(1) To resolve an issue that cannot be resolved at lower levels within the agency (e.g., between two parts of a center or other component of the agency, between two centers or other components of the agency, or between the agency and an interested person outside the agency).</P>
              <P>(2) To review policy matters requiring the attention of center or agency management.</P>
              <P>(3) In unusual situations requiring an immediate review in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(4) As required by delegations of authority.</P>
              <P>(d) Internal agency review of a decision must be based on the information in the administrative file. If an interested person presents new information not in the file, the matter will be returned to the appropriate lower level in the agency for reevaluation based on the new information.</P>

              <P>(h) In accordance with 42 U.S.C 263f, the Commissioner shall consult with interested persons and with the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) before prescribing any performance standard for an electronic product. Accordingly, the Commissioner shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> an announcement when a proposed or final performance standard, including any amendment, is being considered for an electronic product, and any draft of any proposed or final standard will be furnished to an interested person upon request and may be discussed in detail.</P>

              <P>(c) The Commissioner may respond to an oral or written request to the agency as a request for an advisory opinion, in which case the request will be filed with the Division of Dockets Management and be subject to this section.</P>
              <P>(d) A statement of policy or interpretation made in the following documents, unless subsequently repudiated by the agency or overruled by a court, will constitute an advisory opinion:</P>
              <P>(1) Any portion of a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice other than the text of a proposed or final regulation, e.g., a notice to manufacturers or a preamble to a proposed or final regulation.</P>
              <P>(2) Trade Correspondence (T.C. Nos. 1-431 and 1A-8A) issued by FDA between 1938 and 1946.</P>
              <P>(3) Compliance policy guides issued by FDA beginning in 1968 and codified in the Compliance Policy Guides manual.</P>

              <P>(4) Other documents specifically identified as advisory opinions, e.g., advisory opinions on the performance standard for diagnostic X-ray systems, issued before July 1, 1975, and filed in a permanent public file for prior advisory opinions maintained by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov.</E>)</P>
              <P>(e) An advisory opinion represents the formal position of FDA on a matter and except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, obligates the agency to follow it until it is amended or revoked. The Commissioner may not recommend legal action against a person or product with respect to an action taken in conformity with an advisory opinion which has not been amended or revoked.</P>
              <P>(f) In unusual situations involving an immediate and significant danger to health, the Commissioner may take appropriate civil enforcement action contrary to an advisory opinion before amending or revoking the opinion. This action may be taken only with the approval of the Commissioner, who may not delegate this function. Appropriate amendment or revocation of the advisory opinion involved will be expedited.</P>

              <P>(g) An advisory opinion may be amended or revoked at any time after it has been issued. Notice of amendment or revocation will be given in the same manner as notice of the advisory opinion was originally given or in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and will be placed on public display as part of the file on the matter in the office of the Division of Dockets Management. The Division of Dockets Management shall maintain a separate chronological index of all advisory opinions filed. The index will specify the date of the request for the advisory opinion, the date of the opinion, and identification of the appropriate file.</P>
              <P>(h) Action undertaken or completed in conformity with an advisory opinion which has subsequently been amended or revoked is acceptable to FDA unless the Commissioner determines that substantial public interest considerations preclude continued acceptance. Whenever possible, an amended or revoked advisory opinion will state when action previously undertaken or completed does not remain acceptable, and any transition period that may be applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) An interested person may submit written comments on an advisory opinion or modified advisory opinion. Four copies of any comments are to be sent to the Division of Dockets Management for inclusion in the public file on the advisory opinion. Individuals may submit only one copy. Comments will be considered in determining whether further modification of an advisory opinion is warranted.</P>
              <P>(j) An advisory opinion may be used in administrative or court proceedings to illustrate acceptable and unacceptable procedures or standards, but not as a legal requirement.</P>

              <P>(k) A statement made or advice provided by an FDA employee constitutes <PRTPAGE P="186"/>an advisory opinion only if it is issued in writing under this section. A statement or advice given by an FDA employee orally, or given in writing but not under this section or § 10.90, is an informal communication that represents the best judgment of that employee at that time but does not constitute an advisory opinion, does not necessarily represent the formal position of FDA, and does not bind or otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.</P>

A request for official participation must be made by the group or organization in writing, must describe the scope of the activity, and must demonstrate that the minimum standards set out in paragraph (d)(5) of this section are met. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, a request that is granted will be the subject of a letter from the Commissioner or the center director to the organization stating—</P>
              <P>(i) Whether participation by the individual will be as a voting or nonvoting liaison representative;</P>
              <P>(ii) That participation by the individual does not connote FDA agreement with, or endorsement of, any decisions reached; and</P>
              <P>(iii) That participation by the individual precludes service as the deciding official on the standard involved if it should later come before FDA. The deciding official is the person who signs a document ruling upon the standard.</P>

              <P>(i) The activity will be based upon consideration of sound scientific and technological information, will permit revision on the basis of new information, and will be designed to protect the public against unsafe, ineffective, or deceptive products or practices.</P>

              <P>(ii) The activity and resulting standards will not be designed for the economic benefit of any company, group, or organization, will not be used for such antitrust violations as fixing prices or hindering competition, and will not involve establishment of certification or specific approval of individual products or services.<PRTPAGE P="188"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The group or organization responsible for the standard-setting activity must have a procedure by which an interested person will have an opportunity to provide information and views on the activity and standards involved, without the payment of fees, and the information and views will be considered. How this is accomplished, including whether the presentation will be in person or in writing, will be decided by the group or organization responsible for the activity.</P>
              <P>(6) Membership of an FDA employee in an organization that also conducts a standard-setting activity does not invoke the provisions of this section unless the employee participates in the standard-setting activity. Participation in a standard-setting activity is subject to this section.</P>

              <P>(7) The Commissioner may determine in writing that, because direct involvement by FDA in a particular standard-setting activity is in the public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the agency, the participation is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) (ii) and/or (iii) of this section. This determination will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information  (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>) and in any relevant administrative file. The activity may include the establishment and validation of analytical methods for regulatory use, drafting uniform laws and regulations, and the development of recommendations concerning public health and preventive medicine practices by national and international organizations.</P>

              <P>(8) Because of the close daily cooperation between FDA and the associations of State and local government officials listed below in this paragraph, and the large number of agency employees who are members of or work with these associations, participation in the activities of these associations is exempt from paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this section, except that a list of the committees and other groups of these associations will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>).</P>

              <P>(b) A petition, comment, objection, or other representation by an organization will not abridge the right of a member to take individual action of a similar type, in the member's own name.</P>
              <P>(c) It is requested that each organization participating in FDA administrative proceedings file annually with the Division of Dockets Management a current list of all of the members of the organization.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Good guidance practices.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">What are good guidance practices?</E> Good guidance practices (GGP's) are FDA's policies and procedures for developing, issuing, and using guidance documents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What is a guidance document?</E> (1) Guidance documents are documents prepared for FDA staff, applicants/sponsors, and the public that describe the agency's interpretation of or policy on a regulatory issue.</P>
              <P>(2) Guidance documents include, but are not limited to, documents that relate to: The design, production, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and testing of regulated products; the processing, content, and evaluation or approval of submissions; and inspection and enforcement policies.</P>
              <P>(3) Guidance documents do not include: Documents relating to internal FDA procedures, agency reports, general information documents provided to consumers or health professionals, speeches, journal articles and editorials, media interviews, press materials, warning letters, memoranda of understanding, or other communications directed to individual persons or firms.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What other terms have a special meaning?</E> (1) “Level 1 guidance documents” include guidance documents that:</P>
              <P>(i) Set forth initial interpretations of statutory or regulatory requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) Set forth changes in interpretation or policy that are of more than a minor nature;</P>
              <P>(iii) Include complex scientific issues; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Cover highly controversial issues.</P>
              <P>(2) “Level 2 guidance documents” are guidance documents that set forth existing practices or minor changes in interpretation or policy. Level 2 guidance documents include all guidance documents that are not classified as Level 1.</P>
              <P>(3) “You” refers to all affected parties outside of FDA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Are you or FDA required to follow a guidance document?</E> (1) No. Guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable rights or responsibilities. They do not legally bind the public or FDA.</P>
              <P>(2) You may choose to use an approach other than the one set forth in a guidance document. However, your alternative approach must comply with the relevant statutes and regulations. FDA is willing to discuss an alternative approach with you to ensure that it complies with the relevant statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) Although guidance documents do not legally bind FDA, they represent the agency's current thinking. Therefore, FDA employees may depart from guidance documents only with appropriate justification and supervisory concurrence.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Can FDA use means other than a guidance document to communicate new agency policy or a new regulatory approach to a broad public audience?</E> The agency may not use documents or other means of communication that are excluded from the definition of guidance document to informally communicate new or different regulatory expectations to a broad public audience for the first time. These GGP's must be followed whenever regulatory expectations that are not readily apparent from the statute or regulations are first communicated to a broad public audience.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">How can you participate in the development and issuance of guidance documents?</E> (1) You can provide input on guidance documents that FDA is developing under the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) You can suggest areas for guidance document development. Your suggestions should address why a guidance document is necessary.</P>

              <P>(3) You can submit drafts of proposed guidance documents for FDA to consider. When you do so, you should mark the document “Guidance Document Submission” and submit it to Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. If you wish to submit the draft of a proposed guidance document electronically, submit it through <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov</E> at Docket No. FDA-2013-S-0610. It is only necessary to submit one copy.<PRTPAGE P="191"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) You can, at any time, suggest that FDA revise or withdraw an already existing guidance document. Your suggestion should address why the guidance document should be revised or withdrawn and, if applicable, how it should be revised.</P>
              <P>(5) Once a year, FDA will publish, both in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on the Internet, a list of possible topics for future guidance document development or revision during the next year. You can comment on this list (e.g., by suggesting alternatives or making recommendations on the topics that FDA is considering).</P>
              <P>(6) To participate in the development and issuance of guidance documents through one of the mechanisms described in paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), or (f)(4) of this section, you should contact the center or office that is responsible for the regulatory activity covered by the guidance document.</P>
              <P>(7) If FDA agrees to draft or revise a guidance document, under a suggestion made under paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section, you can participate in the development of that guidance document under the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">What are FDA's procedures for developing and issuing guidance documents?</E> (1) FDA's procedures for the development and issuance of Level 1 guidance documents are as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Before FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA can seek or accept early input from individuals or groups outside the agency. For example, FDA can do this by participating in or holding public meetings and workshops.</P>
              <P>(ii) After FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA will:</P>
              <P>(A) Publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing that the draft guidance document is available;</P>
              <P>(B) Post the draft guidance document on the Internet and make it available in hard copy; and</P>
              <P>(C) Invite your comment on the draft guidance document. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments.</P>

              <P>(A) Hold public meetings or workshops; or</P>
              <P>(B) Present the draft guidance document to an advisory committee for review.</P>
              <P>(iv) After providing an opportunity for public comment on a Level 1 guidance document, FDA will:</P>

              <P>(B) Publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing that the guidance document is available;</P>
              <P>(C) Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available in hard copy; and</P>
              <P>(D) Implement the guidance document.</P>
              <P>(v) After providing an opportunity for comment, FDA may decide that it should issue another draft of the guidance document. In this case, FDA will follow the steps in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii), (g)(1)(iii), and (g)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) FDA will not seek your comment before it implements a Level 1 guidance document if the agency determines that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) FDA will use the following procedures for developing and issuing Level 1 guidance documents under the circumstances described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) After FDA prepares a guidance document, FDA will:</P>
              <P>(A) Publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing that the guidance document is available;</P>
              <P>(B) Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available in hard copy;</P>
              <P>(C) Immediately implement the guidance document; and</P>

              <P>(ii) If FDA receives comments on the guidance document, FDA will review those comments and revise the guidance document when appropriate.</P>

              <P>(4) FDA will use the following procedures for developing and issuing Level 2 guidance documents:<PRTPAGE P="192"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) After it prepares a guidance document, FDA will:</P>
              <P>(A) Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available in hard copy;</P>
              <P>(B) Immediately implement the guidance document, unless FDA indicates otherwise when the document is made available; and</P>
              <P>(C) Invite your comment on the Level 2 guidance document. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments.</P>
              <P>(ii) If FDA receives comments on the guidance document, FDA will review those comments and revise the document when appropriate. If a version is revised, the new version will be placed on the Internet.</P>
              <P>(5) You can comment on any guidance document at any time. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments. FDA will revise guidance documents in response to your comments when appropriate.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">How should you submit comments on a guidance document?</E> (1) If you choose to submit comments on any guidance document under paragraph (g) of this section, you must send them to the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.</P>
              <P>(2) Comments should identify the docket number on the guidance document, if such a docket number exists. For documents without a docket number, the title of the guidance document should be included.</P>
              <P>(3) Comments will be available to the public in accordance with FDA's regulations on submission of documents to the Division of Dockets Management specified in § 10.20(j).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">What standard elements must FDA include in a guidance document?</E> (1) A guidance document must:</P>
              <P>(i) Include the term “guidance,”</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify the center(s) or office(s) issuing the document,</P>
              <P>(iii) Identify the activity to which and the people to whom the document applies,</P>
              <P>(iv) Prominently display a statement of the document's nonbinding effect,</P>
              <P>(v) Include the date of issuance,</P>
              <P>(vi) Note if it is a revision to a previously issued guidance and identify the document that it replaces, and</P>
              <P>(vii) Contain the word “draft” if the document is a draft guidance.</P>
              <P>(2) Guidance documents must not include mandatory language such as “shall,” “must,” “required,” or “requirement,” unless FDA is using these words to describe a statutory or regulatory requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) When issuing draft guidance documents that are the product of international negotiations (e.g., guidances resulting from the International Conference on Harmonisation), FDA need not apply paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section. However, any final guidance document issued according to this provision must contain the elements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Who, within FDA, can approve issuance of guidance documents?</E> Each center and office must have written procedures for the approval of guidance documents. Those procedures must ensure that issuance of all documents is approved by appropriate senior FDA officials.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">How will FDA review and revise existing guidance documents?</E> (1) The agency will periodically review existing guidance documents to determine whether they need to be changed or withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(2) When significant changes are made to the statute or regulations, the agency will review and, if appropriate, revise guidance documents relating to that changed statute or regulation.</P>
              <P>(3) As discussed in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, you may at any time suggest that FDA revise a guidance document.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">How will FDA ensure that FDA staff are following GGP's?</E> (1) All current and new FDA employees involved in the development, issuance, or application of guidance documents will be trained regarding the agency's GGP's.</P>
              <P>(2) FDA centers and offices will monitor the development and issuance of guidance documents to ensure that GGP's are being followed.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">How can you get copies of FDA's guidance documents?</E> FDA will make copies available in hard copy and, as feasible, through the Internet.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">How will FDA keep you informed of the guidance documents that are available?</E> (1) FDA will maintain on the <PRTPAGE P="193"/>Internet a current list of all guidance documents. New documents will be added to this list within 30 days of issuance.</P>
              <P>(2) Once a year, FDA will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> its comprehensive list of guidance documents. The comprehensive list will identify documents that have been added to the list or withdrawn from the list since the previous comprehensive list.</P>
              <P>(3) FDA's guidance document lists will include the name of the guidance document, issuance and revision dates, and information on how to obtain copies of the document.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">What can you do if you believe that someone at FDA is not following these GGP's?</E> If you believe that someone at FDA did not follow the procedures in this section or that someone at FDA treated a guidance document as a binding requirement, you should contact that person's supervisor in the center or office that issued the guidance document. If the issue cannot be resolved, you should contact the next highest supervisor. You can also contact the center or office ombudsman for assistance in resolving the issue. If you are unable to resolve the issue at the center or office level or if you feel that you are not making progress by going through the chain of command, you may ask the Office of the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman to become involved.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) FDA has for many years willingly committed itself to a policy of openness. In many instances FDA has sought to make the open portions of agency public administrative proceedings more accessible to public participation. Similarly, FDA has sought, wherever possible, to allow full written media access to its proceedings, so that members of the press would have the opportunity to provide first-hand reports. However, because electronic media coverage presents certain difficulties that are easier to resolve with advance notice to the agency and all participants, FDA believes that codification of its policy will facilitate and further increase media access to its public administrative proceedings. The agency intends to refer to this guideline when notices of hearing, or individual advisory committee meetings, are published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Thus, all parties to a proceeding <PRTPAGE P="194"/>will be on notice that the proceeding may be recorded electronically and any person interested in videotaping or otherwise recording the proceeding will be notified that there are established procedures to be followed.</P>
              <P>(b) The designated presiding officer of a public administrative proceeding retains the existing discretionary authority set forth in specific regulations pertaining to each type of administrative proceeding to regulate the conduct of the proceeding over which he or she presides. The responsibilities of the presiding officer, established elsewhere in parts 10 through 16, include an obligation to be concerned with the timely conduct of a hearing, the limited availability of certain witnesses, and reducing disruptions to the proceeding which may occur. Each proceeding varies, and the presiding officer cannot anticipate all that might occur. Discretionary authority to regulate conduct at a proceeding has traditionally been granted to presiding officers to enable them to fulfill their responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly hearing conducted in an expeditious manner.</P>
              <P>(c) This guideline provides the presiding officer with a degree of flexibility in that it sets forth the agency's policy as well as the procedures that presiding officers should ordinarily follow, but from which they may depart in particular situations if necessary, subject to the presumption of openness of public proceedings to electronic media coverage. The presiding officer's discretion to establish additional procedures or to limit electronic coverage is to be exercised only in the unusual circumstances defined in this guideline. Even though a presiding officer may establish additional procedures or limits as may be required in a particular situation, he or she will be guided by the policy expressed in this guideline in establishing these conditions. The presiding officer may also be less restrictive, taking into account such factors as the duration of a hearing and the design of the room.</P>
              <P>(d) If a portion or all of a proceeding is closed to the public because material is to be discussed that is not disclosable to the public under applicable laws, the proceeding also will be closed to electronic media coverage.</P>
              <P>(e) The agency requests advance notice of intent to record a proceeding electronically to facilitate the orderly conduct of the proceeding. Knowledge of anticipated media coverage will allow the presiding officer to make any special arrangements required by the circumstances of the proceeding. The agency believes that this guideline establishes sufficiently specific criteria to promote uniformity.</P>

              <P>(f) The agency would like to allow all interested media representatives to videotape a proceeding in which they have an interest. However, should space limitations preclude a multitude of cameras, the presiding officer may require pool sharing. In such a case, pool sharing arrangements of the resulting videotape should be made between those allowed to film and those who were excluded. Arrangements for who is designated to present the pool and a method of distributing the resulting film or tape may be determined by the established networks' pooling system. However, the agency has a strong commitment to ensuring that media representatives other than the major networks also be able to obtain a copy of the tape at cost. FDA is concerned that if the network pool representative wishes to record only a short portion of a proceeding, but an excluded party wishes to record the entire proceeding, confusion will result. The agency expects the interested media representatives to negotiate a suitable agreement among themselves before commencement of the proceeding. For example, the network pool representatives might agree to record a portion of the proceeding up to a break in the proceeding, at which time, while the network representative is disassembling equipment, another media representative might set up to continue recording. If an agreement cannot be reached before the proceeding, the agency will use the time of receipt of any advance notice to determine the representation for each category of media, e.g., one network reporter, one independent reporter. The agency recommends that parties intending to videotape provide as much advance notice as possible, so that the agency may best respond to the needs of the electronic media.<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) To ensure the timely conduct of agency hearings and to prevent disruptions, equipment is to be stationary during a proceeding and should be set up and taken down when the proceeding is not in progress. As noted previously, the presiding officer may, at his or her discretion, be less restrictive if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(h) The agency recognizes that electronic media representatives may desire only short footage of a proceeding, a facsimile of the proceeding, and/or interview opportunities and may be unnecessarily restricted by requirements for setting up before a proceeding and then waiting until a break in the proceeding before being permitted to take down their equipment. To accommodate this possibility, FDA's Press Relations Staff will attempt to make arrangements to respond to such needs by, for example, requesting that the presiding officer provide a break shortly after commencement of the proceeding to permit take down of equipment.</P>
              <P>(i) The agency is making a full commitment to allowing, whenever possible, electronic coverage of its public administrative proceedings subject to the limited restrictions established in this guideline.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 10.205</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Electronic media coverage of public administrative proceedings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A person may record electronically any open public administrative proceeding, subject to the procedures specified in this guideline. The procedures include a presumption that agency public proceedings are open to the electronic media. Whenever possible, FDA will permit all interested persons access to record agency public administrative proceedings. Restrictions other than those listed in § 10.206 will be imposed only under exceptional circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) A videotape recording of an FDA public administrative proceeding is not an official record of the proceeding. The only official record is the written transcript of the proceeding, which is taken by the official reporter.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 10.206</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for electronic media coverage of agency public administrative proceedings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To facilitate the agency's response to media needs, a person intending to videotape an FDA public administrative proceeding should, whenever possible, provide advance notice to the Press Relations Staff (HFI-20), Office of Public Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, in writing or by telephone (telephone 301-443-4177), at least 48 hours in advance of the proceeding. The Press Relations Staff will inform the presiding officer that the proceeding will be attended by representatives of the electronic media, and ascertain whether any special provisions in addition to those set forth in this subpart are required by the presiding officer. If so, the Press Relations Staff will function as a liaison between the presiding officer and the person intending to record the proceeding in facilitating any procedures in addition to those outlined in this subpart. The presiding officer will not deny access for failure to provide a 48-hour advance notice. Any advance notice may describe the intended length of recording if known, the amount and type of equipment to be used, and any special needs such as interviews.</P>
              <P>(b) Cameras should be completely set up before a proceeding is scheduled to begin or during a break in the proceeding and should remain standing in the area designated for electronic media equipment. Cameras may be taken down only during breaks or after the hearing is over. Roving cameras will not be permitted during the proceeding. Any artificial lighting should be unobtrusive. Microphones, like cameras, should be in place before the start of a proceeding and may be taken down as indicated in this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(c) When space in the hearing room is limited, the presiding officer may restrict the number of cameras or the equipment present. Should such a restriction become necessary, the pool arrangements are the responsibility of the participating media. The agency encourages the network pool to make <PRTPAGE P="196"/>copies of the tape, film, or other product available at cost to nonpool participants. However, if this is not possible, the agency may need to use the time of receipt of any advance notice to determine the representation for each category, e.g., one network reporter, one independent reporter, etc.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Off the record</E> portions of a proceeding may not be videotaped.</P>
              <P>(e) Before or during the proceeding, the presiding officer may establish other conditions specific to the proceeding for which the request is being made. These conditions may be more or less restrictive than those stated in this guideline, except that the presiding officer shall observe the agency's presumption of openness of its public proceedings to the electronic media. Only a substantial and clear threat to the agency's interests in order, fairness, and timeliness authorizes the presiding officer to impose additional restrictions. This threat must outweigh the public interest in electronic media coverage of agency proceedings. Additional restrictions shall be narrowly drawn to the particular circumstances. The following factors are listed to assist presiding officers in determining whether the agency's interest is sufficiently compelling to call for the unusual step of imposing additional restrictions. Generally this step is justified when one of the following factors is met:</P>
              <P>(1) Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of disruption that clearly cannot be contained by the procedures established in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of prejudicial impact on the fairness of the proceeding or the substantive discussion in a proceeding.</P>
              <P>(3) There is a substantial likelihood that a witness' ability to testify may be impaired due to unique personal circumstances such as the age or psychological state of the witness or the particularly personal or private nature of the witness' testimony, if the witness' testimony were electronically recorded.</P>
              <P>(f) Before the proceeding, the Press Relations Staff will, upon request, provide written copies of any additional conditions imposed by the presiding officer (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) to requesting members of the media. Any appeals should be made in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) The presiding officer retains authority to restrict or discontinue videotaping or other recording of a proceeding, or parts of a proceeding, should such a decision become necessary. The presiding officer's responsibility to conduct the hearing includes the right and duty to remove a source of substantial disruption. In exercising his or her authority, the presiding officer shall observe the presumption that agency public proceedings are open to the electronic media. The presiding officer shall exercise his or her discretion to restrict or discontinue electronic coverage of a public proceeding, or portions of a public proceeding, only if he or she determines that the agency's interest in the fair and orderly administrative process is substantially threatened. A clear and substantial threat to the integrity of agency proceedings must clearly outweigh the public interest in electronic media coverage of the proceedings before additional restrictions are imposed on the electronic media during the course of the proceedings. The factors noted in paragraph (e) of this section indicate the kind of substantial threat to the agency interests that may require imposing additional restrictions during the course of the proceedings. If additional requirements are established during the hearing, the presiding officer shall notify immediately the Deputy Commissioner of Food and Drugs of that fact by telephone and submit a written explanation of the circumstances that necessitated such an action within 24 hours or sooner if requested by the Deputy Commissioner. In the absence or unavailability of the Deputy Commissioner, the presiding officer shall notify the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.</P>

              <P>(h) A decision by a presiding officer, made either before the proceeding or during the course of a proceeding, to establish requirements in addition to the minimum standards set forth in this guideline may be appealed by any adversely affected person who intends <PRTPAGE P="197"/>to record the proceeding electronically. Appeals may be made in writing or by phone to the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, to the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. The filing of an appeal, whether before or during a proceeding, does not require the presiding officer to interrupt the proceeding. However, the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs will resolve an appeal as expeditiously as possible so as to preserve, to the extent possible, the reporters' opportunity to record the proceedings.</P>

              <P>As soon as practicable after the expiration of the time for filing objections to and requests for hearing on agency action involving the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation under sections 502(n), 701(e), or 721(d) of the act or sections 4 or 5 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Commissioner shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> specifying those parts of the regulation that have been stayed by the filing of proper objections and, if no objections have been filed, stating that fact. The notice does not constitute a determination that a hearing is justified on any objections or requests for hearing that have been filed. When to do so will cause no undue delay, the notice required by this section may be combined with the notices described in §§ 12.28 and 12.35.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Ruling on objections and requests for hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As soon as possible the Commissioner will review all objections and requests for hearing filed under § 12.22 and determine—</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the regulation should be modified or revoked under § 12.26;</P>
              <P>(2) Whether a hearing has been justified; and</P>
              <P>(3) Whether, if requested, a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry under part 13 or before a public advisory committee under part 14 or before the Commissioner under part 15 has been justified.</P>
              <P>(b) A request for a hearing will be granted if the material submitted shows the following:</P>
              <P>(1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution at a hearing. A hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.</P>
              <P>(2) The factual issue can be resolved by available and specifically identified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and contentions.</P>
              <P>(3) The data and information submitted, if established at a hearing, would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person. A hearing will be denied if the Commissioner concludes that the data and information submitted are insufficient to justify the factual determination urged, even if accurate.</P>
              <P>(4) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person is adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will not be granted on factual issues that are not determinative with respect to the action requested, e.g., if the Commissioner concludes that the action would be the same even if the factual issue were resolved in the way sought, or if a request is made that a final regulation include a provision not reasonably encompassed by the proposal. A hearing will be granted upon proper objection and request when a food standard or other regulation is shown to have the effect of excluding or otherwise affecting a product or ingredient.</P>
              <P>(5) The action requested is not inconsistent with any provision in the act or any regulation in this chapter particularizing statutory standards. The proper procedure in those circumstances is for the person requesting the hearing to petition for an amendment or waiver of the regulation involved.</P>
              <P>(6) The requirements in other applicable regulations, e.g., §§ 10.20, 12.21, 12.22, 314.200, 514.200, and 601.7(a), and in the notice promulgating the final regulation or the notice of opportunity for hearing are met.</P>
              <P>(c) In making the determination in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner may use any of the optional procedures specified in § 10.30(h) or in other applicable regulations, e.g., §§ 314.200, 514.200, and 601.7(a).</P>
              <P>(d) If it is uncertain whether a hearing has been justified under the principles in paragraph (b) of this section, and the Commissioner concludes that summary decision against the person requesting a hearing should be considered, the Commissioner may serve upon the person by registered mail a proposed order denying a hearing. The person has 30 days after receipt of the proposed order to demonstrate that the submission justifies a hearing.</P>

              <P>(a) The notice will state whether the hearing is denied in whole or in part. If the hearing is denied in part, the notice will be combined with the notice of hearing required by § 12.35, and will specify the objections and requests for hearing that have been granted and denied.</P>
              <P>(1) Any denial will be explained. A denial based on an analysis of the information submitted to justify a hearing will explain the inadequacy of the information.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice will confirm or modify or stay the effective date of the regulation or order involved.</P>
              <P>(b) The record of the administrative proceeding relating to denial of a public hearing in whole or in part on an objection or request for hearing consists of the following:</P>

              <P>(iv) The notice denying a formal evidentiary public hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) If the proceeding involves an order—</P>

              <P>(iv) The notice denying the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) The record specified in paragraph (b) of this section is the exclusive record for the Commissioner's decision on the complete or partial denial of a hearing. The record of the proceeding will be closed as of the date of the Commissioner's decision unless another date is specified. A person who requested and was denied a hearing may submit a petition for reconsideration under § 10.33 or a petition for stay of action under § 10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commissioner with a petition under § 10.25(a) to modify the final regulation or order.</P>

              <P>(d) Denial of a request for a hearing in whole or in part is final agency action reviewable in the courts, under the statutory provisions governing the matter involved, as of the date of publication of the denial in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Before requesting a court for a stay of action pending review, a person shall first submit a petition for a stay of action under § 10.35.</P>
              <P>(2) Under 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), FDA will request consolidation of all petitions on a particular matter.</P>

              <P>(3) The time for filing a petition for judicial review of a denial of a hearing on an objection or issue begins on the date the denial is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> (i) When an objection or issues relates to a regulation, if a hearing is denied on all objections and issues concerning a part of the proposal the effectiveness of which has not been deferred pending a hearing on other parts of the proposal; or (ii) when an issue relates to an order, if a hearing is <PRTPAGE P="206"/>denied on all issues relating to a particular new drug application, new animal drug application, device premarket approval application or product development protocol, or biologics license. The failure to file a petition for judicial review within the period established in the statutory provision governing the matter involved constitutes a waiver of the right to judicial review of the objection or issue, regardless whether a hearing has been granted on other objections and issues.</P>

              <P>(i) In lieu of a request for a hearing under this part; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If submitted after or with a request for hearing, in the form of a waiver of the right to request a hearing conditioned on an alternative form of hearing. Upon acceptance by the Commissioner, the waiver becomes binding and may be withdrawn only by waiving any right to any form of hearing unless the Commissioner determines otherwise.</P>
              <P>(c) When more than one person requests and justifies a hearing under this part, an alternative form of hearing may by used only if all the persons concur and waive their right to request a hearing under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) The Commissioner will determine whether an alternative form of hearing should be used, and if so, which alternative is acceptable, after considering the requests submitted and the appropriateness of the alternatives for the issues raised in the objections.

              <SUBJECT>Advice on public participation in hearings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Designated agency contact.</E> All inquiries from the public about scheduling, location, and general procedures should be addressed to the Deputy Commissioner for Policy (HF-22), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or telephone 301-443-3480. The staff of the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs will attempt to respond promptly to all inquiries from members of the public, as well as to simple requests for information from participants in hearings.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Hearing schedule changes.</E> Requests by hearing participants for changes in the schedule of a hearing or for filing documents, briefs, or other pleadings should be made in writing directly to the Administrative Law Judge (HF-3), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Legal advice to individuals.</E> FDA does not have the resources to provide legal advice to members of the public concerning participation in hearings. Furthermore, to do so would compromise the independence of the Commissioner's office and invite charges of improper interference in the hearing process. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner for Policy (HF-22) will not answer questions about the strengths or weaknesses of a party's position at a hearing, litigation strategy, or similar matters.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Role of the office of the Chief Counsel.</E> Under no circumstances will the office of the Chief Counsel of FDA directly provide advice about a hearing to any person who is participating or may participate in the hearing. In every hearing, certain attorneys in the office are designated to represent the center or centers whose action is the subject of the hearing. Other members of the office, including ordinarily the Chief Counsel, are designated to advise the Commissioner on a final decision in the matter. It is not compatible with these functions, nor would it be professionally responsible, for the attorneys in the office of the Chief Counsel also to advise other participants in a hearing, or for any attorney who may be called on to advise the Commissioner to respond to inquiries from other participants in the hearing, for such participants may be urging views contrary to those of the center involved or to what may ultimately be the final conclusions of the Commissioner. Accordingly, members of the office of the Chief Counsel, other than the attorneys responsible for representing the center whose action is the subject of the hearing, will not answer questions about the hearing from any participant or potential participant.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Communication between participants and attorneys.</E> Participants in a hearing may communicate with the attorneys responsible for representing the center whose action is the subject of the hearing, in the same way that they may communicate with counsel for any other party in interest about the presentation of matters at the hearing. It would be inappropriate to bar discussion of such matters as stipulations of fact, joint presentation of witnesses, or possible settlement of hearing issues. Members of the public, including participants at hearings, are advised, however, that all such communications, including those by telephone, will be recorded in memoranda that can be filed with the Division of Dockets Management.</P>

              <P>(a) Submissions, including pleadings in a hearing, are to be filed with the Division of Dockets Management under § 10.20 except that only two copies need be filed. To determine compliance with filing deadlines in a hearing, a submission is considered submitted on the date it is actually received by the Division of Dockets Management. When this part allows a response to a submission and prescribes a period of time for the filing of the response, an additional 3 days are allowed for the filing of the response if the submission is served by mail.</P>
              <P>(b) The person making a submission shall serve copies of it on the other participants. Submissions of documentary data and information are not required to be served on each participant, but any accompanying transmittal letter, pleading, summary, statement of position, certification under paragraph (d) of this section, or similar document must be served on each participant.</P>
              <P>(c) Service is accomplished by mailing a submission to the address shown in the notice of participation or by personal delivery.</P>

              <P>(b) The petition will be in the form specified in § 10.30 except that the heading will be “Request to Participate in Forma Pauperis, Docket No. __.” Filing and service requirements for the petition are described in paragraph (c) of this section, whether or not the petition is granted. The petition must demonstrate that either: (1) The person is indigent and a strong public interest justifies participation, or (2) the person's participation is in the public interest because it can be considered of primary benefit to the general public.</P>
              <P>(c) The Commissioner may grant or deny the petition. If the petition is granted, the participant need file only one copy of each submission with the Division of Dockets Management. The Division of Dockets Management will make sufficient additional copies for the administrative record, and serve a copy on each other participant.</P>

              <P>(1) The relevant portions of the administrative record of the proceeding. Portions of the administrative record not relevant to the issues in the hearing are not part of the administrative record.</P>

              <P>(2) All documents in the director's files containing factual information, whether favorable or unfavorable to the director's position, which relate to the issues involved in the hearing. <E T="03">Files</E> means the principal files in the center in which documents relating to the issues in the hearing are ordinarily kept, e.g., the food additive master file and the food additive petition in the case of issues concerning a food additive, or the new drug application in the case of issues concerning a new drug. Internal memoranda reflecting the deliberative process, and attorney work product and material prepared specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not required to be submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) All other documentary data and information relied upon.</P>
              <P>(4) A narrative position statement on the factual issues in the notice of hearing and the type of supporting evidence the director intends to introduce.</P>
              <P>(5) A signed statement that, to the director's best knowledge and belief, the submission complies with this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 60 days of the publication of the notice of hearing or, if no participant will be prejudiced, within another period of time set by the presiding officer, each participant shall submit to the Division of Dockets Management all data and information specified in paragraph (a)(2) through (5) of this section, and any objections that the administrative record filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is incomplete. With respect to the data and information specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, participants shall exercise reasonable diligence in identifying documents in files comparable to those described in that paragraph.</P>
              <P>(c) Submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the presiding officer, upon a showing that the material contained in the supplement was not reasonably known or available when the submission was made or that the relevance of the material contained in the supplement could not reasonably have been forseen.</P>

              <P>(d) A participant's failure to comply substantially and in good faith with this section constitutes a waiver of the right to participate further in the hearing; failure of a party to comply constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.<PRTPAGE P="212"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Participants may reference each other's submissions. To reduce duplicative submissions, participants are encouraged to exchange and consolidate lists of documentary evidence. If a particular document is bulky or in limited supply and cannot reasonably be reproduced, and it constitutes relevant evidence, the presiding officer may authorize submission of a reduced number of copies.</P>
              <P>(f) The presiding officer will rule on questions relating to this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose; oral and written testimony; burden of proof.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The objective of a formal evidentiary hearing is the fair determination of relevant facts consistent with the right of all interested persons to participate and the public interest in promptly settling controversial matters affecting the public health and welfare.</P>
              <P>(b) Accordingly, the evidence at a hearing is to be developed to the maximum extent through written submissions, including written direct testimony, which may be in narrative or in question-and-answer form.</P>
              <P>(1) In a hearing, the issues may have general applicability and depend on general facts that do not concern particular action of a specific party, e.g., the safety or effectiveness of a class of drug products, the safety of a food or color additive, or a definition and standard of identity for a food; or the issues may have specific applicability to past action and depend upon particular facts concerning only that party, e.g., the applicability of a grandfather clause to a particular brand of a drug or the failure of a particular manufacturer to meet required manufacturing and processing specifications or other general standards.</P>
              <P>(i) If the proceeding involves general issues, direct testimony will be submitted in writing, except on a showing that written direct testimony is insufficient for a full and true disclosure of relevant facts and that the participant will be prejudiced if unable to present oral direct testimony. If the proceeding involves particular issues, each party may determine whether, and the extent to which, each wishes to present direct testimony orally or in writing.</P>
              <P>(ii) Oral cross-examination of witnesses will be permitted if it appears that alternative means of developing the evidence are insufficient for a full and true disclosure of the facts and that the party requesting oral cross-examination will be prejudiced by denial of the request or that oral cross-examination is the most effective and efficient means to clarify the matters at issue.</P>
              <P>(2) Witnesses shall give testimony under oath.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in a hearing involving issuing, amending, or revoking a regulation or order, the originator of the proposal or petition or of any significant modification will be, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 556(d), the proponent of the regulation or order, and will have the burden of proof. A participant who proposes to substitute a new provision for a provision objected to has the burden of proof in relation to the new provision.</P>
              <P>(d) At a hearing involving issuing, amending, or revoking a regulation or order relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug, device, food additive, or color additive, the participant who is contending that the product is safe or effective or both and who is requesting approval or contesting withdrawal of approval has the burden of proof in establishing safety or effectiveness or both and thus the right to approval. The burden of proof remains on that participant in an amendment or revocation proceeding.</P>

              <P>(1) To expedite the hearing, participants are encouraged to prepare in advance for the prehearing conference. Participants should cooperate with each other, and request information and begin preparation of testimony at the earliest possible time. Failure of a participant to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise matters that could reasonably be anticipated and resolved at that time will not delay the progress of the hearing, and constitutes a waiver of the rights of the participant regarding such matters as objections to the agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding officer and may be grounds for striking the participation under § 12.45.</P>
              <P>(2) Participants shall bring to the prehearing conference the following specific information, which will be filed with the Division of Dockets Management under § 12.80:</P>
              <P>(i) Any additional information to supplement the submission filed under § 12.85, which may be filed if approved under § 12.85(c).</P>
              <P>(ii) A list of all witnesses whose testimony will be offered, orally or in writing, at the hearing, with a full curriculum vitae for each. Additional witnesses may later be identified, with the approval of the presiding officer, on a showing that the witness was not reasonably available at the time of the prehearing conference or the relevance of the witness' views could not reasonably have been foreseen at that time.</P>
              <P>(iii) All prior written statements including articles and any written statement signed or adopted, or a recording or transcription of an oral statement made, by persons identified as witnesses if—</P>

              <P>(2) To identify the most appropriate techniques for developing evidence on issues in controversy and the manner and sequence in which they will be used, including, where oral examination is to be conducted, the sequence in which witnesses will be produced for, and the time and place of, oral examination. The presiding officer may consider—</P>
              <P>(i) Submission of narrative statements of position on factual issues in controversy;</P>
              <P>(ii) Submission of evidence or identification of previously submitted evidence to support such statements, such as affidavits, verified statements of fact, data, studies, and reports;</P>
              <P>(iii) Exchange of written interrogatories directed to particular witnesses;</P>
              <P>(iv) Written requests for the production of additional documentation, data, or other relevant information;</P>

              <P>(3) To group participants with substantially like interests for presenting evidence, making motions and objections, including motions for summary decision, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument.</P>
              <P>(4) To hear and rule on objections to admitting into evidence information submitted under § 12.85.</P>
              <P>(5) To obtain stipulations and admissions of facts.</P>

              <P>(a) After the hearing commences, a participant may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for a summary decision on any issue in the hearing. Any other participant may, within 10 days after service of the motion, which time may be extended for an additional 10 days for good cause, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision. The presiding officer may set the matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs.</P>
              <P>(b) The presiding officer will grant the motion if the objections, requests for hearing, other pleadings, affidavits, and other material filed in connection with the hearing, or matters officially noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a participant is entitled to summary decision.</P>
              <P>(c) Affidavits should set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated. When a properly supported motion for summary decision is made, a participant opposing the motion may not rest upon mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and contentions; affidavits or other responses must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) Should it appear from the affidavits of a participant opposing the motion that for sound reasons stated, facts essential to justify the opposition cannot be presented by affidavit, the presiding officer may deny the motion for summary decision, order a continuance to permit affidavits or additional evidence to be obtained, or issue other just order.</P>

              <P>(e) If on motion under this section a summary decision is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked. and evidentiary facts need to be developed, the presiding officer will issue an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy <PRTPAGE P="215"/>and directing further evidentiary proceedings. The facts so specified will be deemed established.</P>
              <P>(f) A participant may obtain interlocutory review by the Commissioner of a summary decision of the presiding officer.</P>

Upon review, the Commissioner may reopen the hearing to permit the evidence to be admitted if the Commissioner determines that its exclusion was erroneous and prejudicial.</P>
              <P>(e) The presiding officer may schedule conferences as needed to monitor the program of the hearing, narrow and simplify the issues, and consider and rule on motions, requests, and other matters concerning the development of the evidence.</P>
              <P>(f) The presiding officer will conduct such proceedings as are necessary for the taking of oral testimony, for the oral examination of witnesses by the presiding officer on the basis of written questions previously submitted by the parties, and for the conduct of cross-examination of witnesses by the parties. The presiding officer shall exclude irrelevant or repetitious written questions and limit oral cross-examination to prevent irrelevant or repetitious examination.</P>

              <P>(g) The presiding officer shall order the proceedings closed for the taking of oral testimony relating to matters specified in § 10.20(j)(2)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) and (<E T="03">b</E>). Such closed proceedings will be conducted in accordance with § 10.20(j)(3).

              <P>If the Commissioner determines that a Board should be established to conduct a hearing on any matter, a notice of hearing will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> setting forth the following information:</P>
              <P>(a) If the hearing is under § 13.1 (a) or (b), all applicable information described in § 12.32(e).</P>

              <P>(1) Any written document that is to be the subject matter of the hearing will be published as a part of the notice, or the notice will refer to it if the document has already been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or state that the document is available from the Division of Dockets Management or an agency employee designated in the notice.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Members of a Board.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All members of a Board are to have medical, technical, scientific, or other qualifications relevant to the issues to be considered, are subject to the conflict of interest rules applicable to special Government employees, and are to be free from bias or prejudice concerning the issues involved. A member of a Board may be a full-time or part-time Federal Government employee or may serve on an FDA advisory committee but, except with the agreement of all parties, may not currently be a full-time or part-time employee of FDA or otherwise act as a special Government employee of FDA.</P>

              <P>(b) Within 30 days of publication of the notice of hearing, the director of the center of FDA responsible for a <PRTPAGE P="220"/>matter before a Board, the other parties to the proceeding, and any person whose petition was granted and is the subject of the hearing, shall each submit to the Division of Dockets Management the names and full curricula vitae of five nominees for members of the Board. Nominations are to state that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is interested in becoming a member of the Board, and appears to have no conflict of interest.</P>
              <P>(1) Any two or more persons entitled to nominate members may agree upon a joint list of five qualified nominees.</P>
              <P>(2) The lists of nominees must be submitted to the persons entitled to submit a list of nominees under this paragraph but not to all participants. Within 10 days of receipt of the lists of nominees, such persons may submit comments to the Division of Dockets Management on whether the nominees of the other persons meet the criteria established in paragraph (a) of this section. A person submitting comments to the Division of Dockets Management shall submit them to all persons entitled to submit a list of nominees.</P>
              <P>(3) The lists of nominees and comments on them are to be held in confidence by the Division of Dockets Management as part of the administrative record of the proceeding and are not to be made available for public disclosure, and all persons who submit or receive them shall similarly hold them in confidence. This portion of the administrative record remains confidential but is available for judicial review in the event that it becomes relevant to any issue before a court.</P>
              <P>(c) After reviewing the lists of nominees and any comments, the Commissioner will choose three qualified persons as members of a Board. One member will be from the lists of nominees submitted by the director of the center and by any person whose petition was granted and is the subject of the hearing. The second will be from the lists of nominees submitted by the other parties. The Commissioner may choose the third member from any source. That member is the Chairman of the Board.</P>
              <P>(1) If the Commissioner is unable to find a qualified person with no conflict of interest from among a list of nominees or if additional information is needed, the Commissioner will request the submission of the required additional nominees or information.</P>
              <P>(2) If a person fails to submit a list of nominees as required by paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner may choose a qualified member without further consultation with that person.</P>
              <P>(3) The Commissioner will announce the members of a Board by filing a memorandum in the record of the proceeding and sending a copy to all participants.</P>
              <P>(d) Instead of using the selection method in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the director of the center, the other parties to the proceeding, and any person whose petition was granted and is the subject of the hearing, may, with the approval of the Commissioner, agree that a standing advisory committee listed in § 14.80 constitutes the Board for a particular proceeding, or that another procedure is to be used for selection of the members of the Board, or that the Board consists of a larger number of members.</P>
              <P>(e) The members of a Board serve as consultants to the Commissioner and are special Government employees or Government employees. A Board functions as an administrative law tribunal in the proceeding and is not an advisory committee subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act or part 14.</P>
              <P>(f) The Chairman of the Board has the authority of a presiding officer set out in § 12.70.</P>

              <P>(a) The proceeding of a Board are subject to the provisions of § 10.55 relating to separation of functions and ex parte communications. Representatives of the participants in any proceeding before a Board, including any members of the office of the Chief Counsel of FDA assigned to advise the center responsible for the matter, may have no contact with the members of the Board, except as participants in the proceeding, and may not participate in the deliberations of the Board.<PRTPAGE P="221"/>

              <P>(b) Administrative support for a Board is to be provided only by the office of the Commissioner and the office of the Chief Counsel for FDA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disclosure of data and information by the participants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Before the notice of hearing is published under § 13.5, the director of the center responsible for the matters involved in the hearing must submit to the Division of Dockets Management—</P>
              <P>(1) The relevant portions of the existing administrative record of the proceeding. Portions of the administrative record not relevant to the issues in the hearing are not part of the administrative record;</P>
              <P>(2) A list of all persons whose views will be presented orally or in writing at the hearing;</P>

              <P>(3) All documents in the director's files containing factual information, whether favorable or unfavorable to the director's position, which relate to the issues involved in the hearing. <E T="03">Files</E> means the principal files in the center in which documents relating to the issues in the hearing are ordinarily kept, e.g., the food additive master file and the food additive petition in the case of issues concerning a food additive, or the new drug application in the case of issues concerning a new drug. Internal memoranda reflecting the deliberative process, and attorney work product and material prepared specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not required to be submitted;</P>
              <P>(4) All other documentary information relied on; and</P>
              <P>(5) A signed statement that, to the best of the director's knowledge and belief, the submission complies with this section.</P>

With respect to the information specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, participants are to exercise reasonable diligence in identifying documents in files comparable to those described in that paragraph.</P>
              <P>(c) The submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the Board, on a showing that the views of the persons or the material contained in the supplement was not known or reasonably available when the initial submission was made or that the relevance of the views of the persons or the material contained in the supplement could not reasonably have been foreseen.</P>

              <P>(d) The failure to comply substantially and in good faith with this section in the case of a participant constitutes a waiver of the right to participate further in the hearing and in <PRTPAGE P="222"/>the case of a party constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.</P>
              <P>(e) The Chairman rules on questions relating to this section. Any participant dissatisfied with a ruling may petition the Commissioner for interlocutory review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Proceedings of a Board.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The purpose of a Board is to review medical, scientific, and technical issues fairly and expeditiously. The proceedings of a Board are conducted as a scientific inquiry rather than a legal trial.</P>
              <P>(b) A Board may not hold its first hearing until after all participants have submitted the information required by § 13.25.</P>
              <P>(c) The Chairman calls the first hearing of the Board. Notice of the time and location of the first hearing is to be published at least 15 days in advance and the hearing will be open to the public. All participants will have an opportunity at the first hearing to make an oral presentation of the information and views which in their opinion are pertinent to the resolution of the issues being considered by a Board. A participant's presentation may be made by more than one person. The Chairman determines the order of the presentation. Participants may not interrupt a presentation, but members of the Board may ask questions. At the conclusion of a presentation, each of the other participants may briefly comment on the presentation and may request that the Board conduct further questioning on specified matters. Members of the Board may then ask further questions. Any other participant may be permitted to ask questions if the Chairman determines that it will help resolve the issues.</P>
              <P>(d) The hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views may be made or considered, but other participants may comment upon or rebut all such information and views. No participant may interrupt the presentation of another participant for any reason.</P>
              <P>(e) Within the time specified by the Board after its first hearing, participants may submit written rebuttal information and views in accordance with § 13.20. The Chariman will then schedule a second hearing, if requested and justified by a participant. A second hearing, and any subsequent hearing, will be called only if the Chairman concludes that it is needed to fully and fairly present information that cannot otherwise adequately be considered and to properly resolve the issues. Notice of the time and location of any hearing is to be published at least 15 days in advance. The hearing is open to the public.</P>
              <P>(f) A Board may consult with any person who it concludes may have information or views relevant to the issues.</P>
              <P>(1) The consultation may occur only at an announced hearing of a Board. Participants have the right to suggest or, with the permission of the Chairman, ask questions of the consultant and present rebuttal information and views, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section except that written statements may be submitted to the Board with the consent of all participants.</P>
              <P>(2) A participant may submit a request that the Board consult with a specific person who may have information or views relevant to the issues. The request will state why the person should be consulted and why the person's views cannot be furnished to the Board by means other than having FDA arrange for the person's appearance. The Board may, in its discretion, grant or deny the request.</P>

              <P>(g) All hearings are to be transcribed. All hearings are open to the public, except that a hearing under § 10.20(j)(3) is closed to all persons except those persons making and participating in the presentation and Federal Government executive branch employees and special Government employees. At least a majority of Board members are to be present at every hearing. The executive sessions of a Board, during which a Board deliberates on the issues, are to be closed and are not transcribed. All members of the Board shall vote on the report of the Board.<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) All legal questions are to be referred to the Chief counsel for FDA for resolution. The Chief Counsel's advice on any matter of procedure or legal authority is to be transmitted in writing and made a part of the record or presented in open session and transcribed.</P>
              <P>(i) At the conclusion of all public hearings the Board will announce that the record is closed to receiving information. The Board will provide an opportunity for participants to submit written statements of their positions, with proposed findings and conclusions, and may in its discretion, provide an opportunity for participants to summarize their positions orally.</P>
              <P>(j) The Board will prepare a decision on all issues. The decision is to include specific findings and references supporting and explaining the Board's conclusions, and a detailed statement of the reasoning on which the conclusions are based. Any member of the Board may file a separate report stating additional or dissenting views.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 14.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part governs the procedures when any of the following applies:</P>

              <P>(1) The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it is in the public interest for a standing or ad hoc policy or technical public advisory committee (<E T="03">advisory committee</E> or <E T="03">committee</E>) to hold a public hearing and to review and make recommendations on any matter before FDA and for interested persons to present information and views at an oral public hearing before the advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(2) Under specific provisions in the FD&amp;C Act or other sections of this chapter, a matter is subject to a hearing before an advisory committee. The specific provisions are—</P>
              <P>(i) Section 14.120 on review of a performance standard for an electronic product by the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC);</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 14.140 on review of the safety of color additives;</P>
              <P>(iii) Section 14.160 on review of the safety and effectiveness of human prescription drugs;</P>
              <P>(iv) Section 330.10 on review of the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter drugs;</P>
              <P>(v) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(vi) Part 860, on classification of devices;</P>

              <P>(vii) Section 514(b)(5) of the FD&amp;C Act on establishment, amendment, or <PRTPAGE P="225"/>revocation of a device performance standard;</P>
              <P>(viii) Section 515 of the FD&amp;C Act on review of device premarket approval applications and product development protocols; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Section 520(f) of the FD&amp;C Act on review of device good manufacturing practice regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) A person who has a right to an opportunity for a formal evidentiary public hearing under part 12 waives that opportunity and instead under § 12.32 requests a hearing before an advisory committee, and the Commissioner, as a matter of discretion, accepts the request.</P>
              <P>(b) In determining whether a group is a <E T="03">public advisory committee</E> as defined in § 10.3(a) and thus subject to this part and to the Federal advisory Committee Act, the following guidelines will be used:</P>
              <P>(1) An advisory committee may be a standing advisory committee or an ad hoc advisory committee. All standing advisory committees are listed in § 14.100.</P>
              <P>(2) An advisory committee may be a policy advisory committee or a technical advisory committee. A policy advisory committee advises on broad and general matters. A technical advisory committee advises on specific technical or scientific issues, which may relate to regulatory decisions before FDA.</P>
              <P>(3) An advisory committee includes any of its subgroups when the subgroup is working on behalf of the committee. Section 14.40(d) describes when a subgroup will be established as an advisory committee separate from the parent committee.</P>
              <P>(4) A committee composed entirely of full-time Federal Government employees is not an advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(5) An advisory committee ordinarily has a fixed membership, a defined purpose of providing advice to the agency on a particular subject, regular or periodic meetings, and an organizational structure, for example, a Chairperson and staff, and serves as a source of independent expertise and advice rather than as a representative of or advocate for any particular interest. The following groups are not advisory committees:</P>
              <P>(i) A group of persons convened on an ad hoc basis to discuss a matter of current interest to FDA, but which has no continuing function or organization and does not involve substantial special preparation.</P>
              <P>(ii) A group of two or more FDA consultants meeting with the agency on an ad hoc basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) A group of experts who are employed by a private company or a trade association which has been requested by FDA to provide its views on a regulatory matter pending before FDA.</P>
              <P>(iv) A consulting firm hired by FDA to provide advice regarding a matter.</P>

              <P>(6) An advisory committee that is utilized by FDA is subject to this subpart even though it was not established by FDA. In general, a committee is <E T="03">utilized</E> when FDA requests advice or recommendations from the committee on a specific matter in order to obtain an independent review and consideration of the matter, and not when FDA is merely seeking the comments of all interested persons or of persons who have a specific interest in the matter.</P>
              <P>(i) A committee formed by an independent scientific or technical organization is utilized if FDA requests advice of that committee rather than of the parent organization, or if the circumstances show that the advice given is that of the committee and not of the parent organization. A committee formed by an independent scientific or technical organization is not utilized if FDA requests advice of the organization rather than of a committee and if the recommendations of any committee formed in response to the request are subject to substantial independent policy and factual review by the governing body of the parent organization.</P>
              <P>(ii) A committee is not utilized by FDA if it provides only information, as contrasted with advice or opinions or recommendations.</P>

              <P>(iii) FDA is charged with seeking out the views of all segments of the public on enforcement of the laws administered by the Commissioner. The fact that a group of individuals or a committee meets regularly with FDA, for example, a monthly meeting with consumer representatives, does not make that group or committee an advisory <PRTPAGE P="226"/>committee. Thus, this subpart does not apply to routine meetings, discussions, and other dealings, including exchanges of views, between FDA and any committee representing or advocating the particular interests of consumers, industry, professional organizations, or others.</P>
              <P>(7) The inclusion of one or two FDA consultants who are special Government employees on an internal FDA committee does not make that committee an advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(8) A Public Board of Inquiry established under part 13, or other similar group convened by agreement between the parties to a regulatory proceeding pending before FDA to review and prepare an initial decision on the issues in lieu of a formal evidentiary public hearing, is acting as an administrative law tribunal and is not an advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(9) An open public conference or meeting conducted under § 10.65(b) is not an advisory committee meeting.</P>
              <P>(10) An FDA committee that primarily has operational responsibility rather than that of providing advice and recommendations is not an advisory committee, for example, the Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC).</P>
              <P>(c) This part applies only when a committee convenes to conduct committee business. Site visits, social gatherings, informal discussions by telephone or during meals or while traveling or at other professional functions, or other similar activities do not constitute a meeting.</P>
              <P>(d) An advisory committee that is utilized but not established by FDA is subject to this part only to the extent of such utilization, and not concerning any other activities of such committee.</P>
              <P>(e) Any conference or meeting between an employee of FDA and a committee or group which is not an advisory committee shall be subject to § 10.65 or other provisions specifically applicable to the committee or group, for example, part 13 for a Public Board of Inquiry.</P>
              <P>(f) This part applies to all FDA advisory committees, except to the extent that specific statutes require otherwise for a particular committee, for example, TEPRSSC and advisory committees established under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976.</P>

              <P>(a) An advisory committee is utilized to conduct public hearings on matters of importance that come before FDA, to review the issues involved, and to provide advice and recommendations to the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner has sole discretion concerning action to be taken and policy to be expressed on any matter considered by an advisory committee.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative remedies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A person who alleges noncompliance by the Commissioner or an advisory committee with any provision of this part or the Federal Advisory Committee Act may pursue the following administrative remedies:</P>
              <P>(a) If the person objects to any action, including a failure to act, other than denial of access to an advisory committee document, the person shall submit a petition in the form and in accordance with the requirements of § 10.30. The provisions of § 10.45 relating to exhaustion of administrative remedies are applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) If the person objects to past action, the person shall submit the petition within 30 days after the action objected to. If the Commissioner determines that there was noncompliance with any provision of this subpart or of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Commissioner will grant any appropriate relief and take appropriate steps to prevent its future recurrence.</P>
              <P>(2) If the person objects to proposed future action, the Commissioner will expedite the review of the petition and make a reasonable effort to render a decision before the action concerned in the petition.</P>

              <P>(3) If the person objects to action that is imminent or occurring and which could not reasonably have been anticipated, e.g., the closing of a portion of a meeting which is made known for the first time on the day of the meeting, the matter may be handled by <PRTPAGE P="227"/>an oral petition in lieu of a written petition.</P>
              <P>(b) If the person objects to a denial of access to an advisory committee document, administrative review is in accordance with the procedures established by the Department of Health and Human Services under 45 CFR 5.34.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability to Congress.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part applies to Congress, individual Members of Congress, and other employees or representatives of Congress in the same way that they apply to any other member of the public, except that disclosure of advisory committee records to Congress is governed by § 20.87.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 14.15</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Committees working under a contract with FDA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FDA may enter into contracts with independent scientific or technical organizations to obtain advice and recommendations on particular matters, and these organizations may in turn undertake such work through existing or new committees. Whether a particular committee working under such a contract is an advisory committee subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this subpart depends upon application of the criteria and principles in § 14.1(b).</P>
              <P>(b) The following minimum standards apply to any committee of an independent scientific or technical organization which is working under a contract initially executed with FDA after July 1, 1975, but which is determined not to be an advisory committee:</P>

              <P>(1) The committee shall give public notice of its meetings and agenda, and provide interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant information and views in writing at any time, and orally at specified times. The notice may be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or disseminated by other reasonable means. It is in any event to be filed with the Division of Dockets Management not less than 15 days before the meeting. The time for oral presentations and the extent to which the committee meets in open session other than for such oral presentations is in the discretion of the committee.</P>
              <P>(2) Minutes of open sessions are to be maintained, with all written submissions attached which were made to the committee in open session. After approval, the minutes are to be forwarded to the Division of Dockets Management and placed on public display. The extent to which the committee maintains minutes of closed sessions is in the discretion of the committee.</P>
              <P>(3) In selecting the members of the committee, the organization involved is to apply the principles relating to conflicts of interest that FDA uses in establishing a public advisory committee. Those principles are set out or cross-referenced in this part and in part 19. Upon request, FDA will assist or provide guidance to any organization in meeting this requirement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice of hearing before an advisory committee.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Before the first of each month, and at least 15 days in advance of a meeting, the Commissioner will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of all advisory committee meetings to be held during the month. Any advisory committee meetings for that month called after the publication of the general monthly notice are to be announced in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on an individual basis at least 15 days in advance. The Commissioner may authorize an exception to these notice requirements in an emergency or for other reasons requiring an immediate meeting of an advisory committee, in which case public notice will be given at the earliest time and in the most accessible form feasible including, whenever possible, publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice will include—</P>

              <P>(4) A list of all agenda items, showing whether each will be discussed in an open or closed portion of the meeting;</P>

              <P>(5) If any portion of the meeting is closed, a statement of the time of the open and closed portions;<PRTPAGE P="228"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) The nature of the subjects to be discussed during, and the reasons for closing, any closed portion of the meeting;</P>
              <P>(7) The time set aside for oral statements and other public participation;</P>
              <P>(8) The name, address, and telephone number of the advisory committee Designated Federal Officer and any other agency employee designated as responsible for the administrative support for the advisory committee;</P>
              <P>(9) A statement that written submissions may be made to the advisory committee through the Designated Federal Officer at any time, unless a cutoff date has been established under § 14.35(d)(2);</P>
              <P>(10) When a notice is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> less than 15 days before a meeting, an explanation for the lateness of the notice; and</P>

              <P>(c) If a public hearing before an advisory committee is used in lieu of a formal evidentiary public hearing under § 14.1(a)(3), an initial notice of hearing is to be published separately in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> containing all the information described in § 12.32(e). This procedure may be used for any other hearing before an advisory committee when the Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it would be informative to the public.</P>
              <P>(d) A list of advisory committee meetings will be distributed to the press by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meetings of an advisory committee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) No advisory committee may conduct a meeting except at the call or with the advance approval of, and with an agenda approved by, the designated Federal employee or alternate. No meeting may be held in the absence of the designated Federal employee.</P>

              <P>(1) If any matter is added to the agenda after its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under § 14.20(b)(4), an attempt is to be made to inform persons known to be interested in the matter, and the change is to be announced at the beginning of the open portion of the meeting.</P>
              <P>(2) The advisory committee meeting is to be conducted in accordance with the approved final agenda insofar as practical.</P>
              <P>(b) Advisory committee meetings will be held at places that are reasonably accessible to the public. All advisory committee meetings will be held in Washington, DC, or Rockville, MD, or the immediate vicinity, unless the Commissioner receives and approves a written request from the advisory committee for a different location. A different location may be approved when one or more of the following applies:</P>
              <P>(1) The total cost of the meeting to the Government will be reduced.</P>
              <P>(2) A substantial number of the committee members will be at the location at no expense to FDA for other reasons, e.g., for a meeting of a professional association.</P>
              <P>(3) It is a central location more readily accessible to committee members.</P>
              <P>(4) There is a need for increased participation available at that location.</P>
              <P>(5) The committee wishes to review work or facilities in a specific location.</P>
              <P>(6) The committee is concerned with matters that functionally or historically occur in some other location, e.g., the Science Advisory Board of the National Center for Toxicological Research will generally hold meetings in the Little Rock, AR, vicinity.</P>
              <P>(c) Advisory committee members may, with the approval of FDA, conduct onsite visits relevant to their work.</P>
              <P>(d) Unless the committee charter provides otherwise, a quorum for an advisory committee is a majority of the current voting members of the committee, except as provided in § 14.125(c) for TEPRSSC. Any matter before the advisory committee is to be decided by a majority vote of the voting members present at the time, except that the designated Federal official may require that any final report be voted upon by all current voting members of the committee. Any current voting member of the committee may file a separate report with additional or minority views.</P>

              <P>(e) If space is available, any interested person may attend any portion of <PRTPAGE P="229"/>any advisory committee meeting which is not closed.</P>
              <P>(f) Whenever feasible, meetings are to be held in government facilities or other facilities involving the least expense to the public.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">The open public hearing.</E> Every committee meeting includes an open portion, which constitutes a public hearing during which interested persons may present relevant information or views orally or in writing. The hearing is conducted in accordance with § 14.29.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination to close portions of advisory committee meetings.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) No committee meeting may be entirely closed. A portion of a meeting may be closed only in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="230"/>a written determination by the Commissioner under this section.</P>

              <P>(b) The Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency employee shall prepare the initial request for a determination to close a portion of a meeting, specifying the matter(s) to be discussed during the closed portion and the reasons why the portion should be closed. The Commissioner, based upon this request and with the concurrence of the Chief Counsel, will determine whether to close a portion of a meeting. The reasons for closing a portion of a meeting will be announced in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of the meeting under § 14.20 in accordance with the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Any determination to close a portion of a meeting restricts the closing to the shortest possible time consistent with the policy in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A portion of a meeting may be closed only if the Commissioner determines that the closing is permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), and that the closing is necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) Portions of meetings may ordinarily be closed if they concern the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts or regulations, guidance documents or similar preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure would significantly impede proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes; and review of matters, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
              <P>(4) Portions of meetings ordinarily may not be closed if they concern review, discussion, and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices; consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs and devices; review of information on specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any other information not exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c); the formulation of advice and recommendations to FDA on matters that do not independently justify closing.</P>
              <P>(5) No portion of a meeting devoted to matters other than those designated in paragraph (b) (1) through (3) of this section may be closed.</P>
              <P>(6) A matter which is properly considered in an open portion of a meeting may instead be considered in a closed portion only if it is so inextricably intertwined with matters to be discussed in a closed portion that it is not feasible to separate them or discussion of the matter in an open portion would compromise the matters to be discussed in the closed portion.</P>
              <P>(c) Attendance at a closed portion of a meeting is governed by the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) A portion of a meeting closed for the presentation or discussion of information that constitutes a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in § 20.61 may be attended only by voting advisory committee members, nonvoting members representing consumer interests who are also special government employees as provided in § 14.80(b), the Designated Federal Officer of the advisory committee, a transcriber, consultants, and such other regular employees of FDA (including members of the Office of the Chief Counsel) as the Chairperson of the advisory committee may invite, and by those persons authorized to be present under § 14.25(c), for presentation of information prohibited from public disclosure. A person making a presentation described in § 14.25(c) may be accompanied by a reasonable number of employees, consultants, or other persons in a commercial arrangement within the meaning of § 20.81(a).</P>

              <P>(2) A portion of a meeting that has been closed for consideration of existing internal agency documents falling within § 20.62 where premature disclosure is likely to significantly impede proposed agency action; personnel, medical, and similar files, disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of § 20.63; or investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes as defined in § 20.64 may be attended only by committee members (voting and nonvoting), the Designated Federal Officer of the committee, a <PRTPAGE P="231"/>transcriber, and other regular employees of FDA (including members of the Office of the Chief Counsel) whom the Chairperson of the committee may invite. Consultants, individuals performing personal service contracts, employees of other Federal agencies, and the general public may not attend such portions.</P>
              <P>(3) If a person other than a person permitted to attend in accordance with paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section attempts to attend a closed portion of a meeting without the approval of the Designated Federal Officer and the Chairperson, and the matter is brought to their attention, the person will be required to leave the meeting immediately. This inadvertent and unauthorized attendance does not enable other unauthorized persons to attend, nor does it, of itself, constitute grounds for release of transcripts of closed portions or any other documents otherwise exempt from disclosure under § 14.75 and part 20.</P>
              <P>(4) If a person other than a person permitted to attend in accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section is allowed by the Designated Federal Officer and the Chairperson to attend a closed portion of a meeting, that portion is open to attendance by any interested person.</P>

              <P>(a) For each meeting, the open portion for public participation, which constitutes a public hearing under § 14.25(a), will be at least 1 hour, unless public participation does not last that long, and may last for whatever longer time the committee Chairperson determines will facilitate the work of the committee. The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice published under § 14.20 will designate the time specifically reserved for the hearing, which is ordinarily the first portion of the meeting. Further public participation in any open portion of the meeting under § 14.25(b) is solely at the discretion of the Chairperson.</P>
              <P>(b) An interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at a meeting shall inform the Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency employee, orally or in writing, before the meeting.</P>
              <P>(1) The person shall state the general nature of the presentation and the approximate time desired. Whenever possible, all written information to be discussed by that person at the meeting should be furnished in advance to the Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency employee. This material may be distributed or mailed by FDA to the committee members in advance of the meeting if time permits, and otherwise will be distributed to the members when they arrive for the meeting. The mailing or distribution may be undertaken only by FDA unless FDA grants permission to a person to mail or distribute the material</P>
              <P>(2) Before the meeting, the Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency employee shall determine the amount of time allocated to each person for oral presentation and the time that the presentation is to begin. Each person will be so informed in writing, if time permits, or by telephone. FDA may require persons with common interests to make joint presentations.</P>
              <P>(c) The Chairperson of the committee shall preside at the meeting in accordance with § 14.30 and be accompanied by other committee members, who serve as a panel in conducting the hearing portion of the meeting.</P>
              <P>(d) Each person may use the allotted time as desired, consistent with an orderly hearing. A person may be accompanied by additional persons, and may present any written information or views for inclusion in the record of the hearing, subject to the requirements of § 14.35(c).</P>
              <P>(e) If a person is absent at the time specified for that person's presentation, the persons following will appear in order. An attempt will be made to hear the person at the conclusion of the hearing. Interested persons attending the hearing who did not request an opportunity to make an oral presentation may be given an opportunity to do so at the discretion of the Chairperson.</P>

              <P>(f) The Chairperson and other members may question a person concerning <PRTPAGE P="232"/>that person's presentation. No other person, however, may question the person. The Chairperson may allot additional time when it is in the public interest, but may not reduce the time allotted without consent of the person.</P>
              <P>(g) Participants may question a committee member only with that member's permission and only about matters before the committee.</P>
              <P>(h) The hearing is informal, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views may be made or considered, but other participants may comment upon or rebut matters presented. No participant may interrupt the presentation of another participant.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Chairperson is not a full-time employee of FDA, the Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency employee, or alternate, is to be the <E T="03">designated Federal employee</E> who is assigned to the advisory committee.

              <P>(c) A committee may confer with a person who is not a Federal Government executive branch employee only during the open portions of a meeting. The person may, however, submit views in writing to the committee as part of the administrative record under § 14.70. The person may participate at the closed portions of a meeting only if appointed as a special Government employee by the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.

              <P>(e) The Commissioner may appoint persons as special Government employees to be consultants to an advisory committee. Consultants may be appointed to provide expertise, generally concerning a highly technical matter, not readily available from the members of the committee. Consultants may be either from outside the Government or from agencies other than the Food and Drug Administration.

              <SUBJECT>Establishment and renewal of advisory committees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An advisory committee may be established or renewed whenever it is necessary or appropriate for the committee to hold a public hearing and to review and make recommendations on any matter pending before FDA. Except for committees established by statute, before a committee is established or renewed it must first be approved by the Department pursuant to 45 CFR part 11 and by the General Services Administration.</P>

              <P>(b) When an advisory committee is established or renewed, the Commissioner will issue a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice certifying that the establishment or renewal is in the public interest and stating the structure, function, and purposes of the committee and, if it is a standing advisory committee, shall amend § 14.100 to add it to the list of standing advisory committees. A notice of establishment will be published at least 15 days before the filing of the advisory committee charter under paragraph (c) of this section. A notice of renewal does not require the 15-day notice.</P>
              <P>(c) No committee may meet or take action until its charter is prepared and filed as required by section 9(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This requirement is to be met by an advisory committee utilized by FDA, even though it is not established by the agency, prior to utilization.</P>
              <P>(d) The regulations of the Department cited in paragraph (a) of this section provide that the charter of a parent committee may incorporate information concerning activities of a subgroup. In such instances, a subgroup will not be established as a committee distinct from the parent committee. However, a subgroup will be established as a separate committee when the charter of the parent committee does not incorporate the activities of the subgroup, or when the subgroup includes members who are not all drawn from the parent committee.</P>
              <P>(e) An advisory committee not required to be established by law will be established or utilized only if it is in the public interest and only if its functions cannot reasonably be performed by other existing advisory committees or by FDA.</P>
              <P>(f) An advisory committee must meet the following standards:</P>
              <P>(1) Its purpose is clearly defined.</P>
              <P>(2) Its membership is balanced fairly in terms of the points of view represented in light of the functions to be performed. Although proportional representation is not required, advisory committee members are selected without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, age, or sex.</P>
              <P>(3) It is constituted and utilizes procedures designed to assure that its advice and recommendations are the result of the advisory committee's independent judgment.</P>
              <P>(4) Its staff is adequate. The Commissioner designates an Designated Federal Officer and alternate for every advisory committee, who are employees of FDA. The Designated Federal Officer is responsible for all staff support unless other agency employees are designated for this function.</P>
              <P>(5) Whenever feasible, or required by statute, it includes representatives of the public interest.</P>

A committee may be renewed for as many 2-year periods as the public interest requires. The requirements for establishment of a committee under § 14.40 also apply to its renewal.</P>

              <P>(c) TEPRSSC is a permanent statutory advisory committee established by section 358(f)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, transferred to the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 360kk(f)(1)(A)), and is not subject to termination and renewal under paragraph (a) of this section, except that a new charter is prepared and filed at the end of each 2-year period as provided in § 14.40(c).

              <P>(2) Are subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations either as special Government employees or as members of the uniformed services, including the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (the Commissioner has determined that, because members representing particular interests, e.g., a representative of labor, industry, consumers, or agriculture, are included on advisory committees specifically for the purpose of representing these interests, any financial interest covered by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) in the class which the member represents <PRTPAGE P="238"/>is irrelevant to the services which the Government expects from them and thus is hereby exempted under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) as too remote and inconsequential to affect the integrity of their services); and</P>

              <P>(i) Shall have expertise in the subject matter with which the committee is concerned and have diverse professional education, training, and experience so that the committee will reflect a balanced composition of sufficient scientific expertise to handle the problems that come before it; and</P>

              <P>(2) The Commissioner shall, when required by statute, and may when not required by statute, provide for nonvoting members of a technical advisory committee to serve as representatives of and liaison with interested organizations. Nonvoting members—</P>
              <P>(i) Shall be selected by the interested organizations, as provided in § 14.84; technical expertise in the subject matter with which the committee is involved is not a requirement; and</P>

              <P>(c) A person may serve as a voting or nonvoting member on only one FDA advisory committee unless the Commissioner determines in writing that dual membership will aid the work of the committees involved and is in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(d) Members of FDA advisory committees, and the Chairperson, are appointed from among those nominated under §§ 14.82 and 14.84 and from any other sources by the Secretary, or, by delegation of authority, by the Assistant Secretary for Health, or the Commissioner.</P>

Good cause includes excessive absenteeism from committee meetings, a demonstrated bias that interferes with the ability to render objective advice, failure to abide by the procedures established in this subpart, or violation of other applicable rules and regulations, e.g., for nonvoting members, the provisions of § 14.86(c).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nominations and selection of nonvoting members of standing technical advisory committees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies when the Commissioner concludes that a technical advisory committee should include nonvoting members to represent and serve as a liaison with interested individuals and organizations.</P>
              <P>(b) Except when the Commissioner concludes otherwise, nonvoting members of a technical advisory committee are selected in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and are normally limited to one person selected by consumer groups and organizations and one person selected by industry groups and organizations.</P>

              <P>(c) To select a nonvoting member to represent consumer interests, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the Commissioner publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> requesting nominations for each specific committee, or subcommittee, for which nonvoting members are to be appointed.</P>
              <P>(1) A period of 30 days will be permitted for submission of nominations for that committee or subcommittee. Interested persons may nominate one or more qualified persons to represent consumer interests. Although nominations from individuals will be accepted, individuals are encouraged to submit their nominations through consumer organizations as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Nominations of qualified persons for general consideration as nonvoting members of unspecified advisory committees or subcommittees may be made at any time. All nominations are to be submitted in writing to Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 32, rm. 1503, Silver Spring, MD 20993.</P>
              <P>(2) A complete curriculum vitae of any nominee is to be included. Nominations must state that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is willing to serve as a member of an advisory committee, and appears to have no conflict of interest. The nomination must state whether a nominee is interested only in a particular advisory committee or subcommittee, or whether the nominee is interested in becoming a member of any advisory committee or subcommittee. Nominations that do not comply with the requirements of this paragraph will not be considered.</P>
              <P>(3) The Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff will compile a list of organizations whose objectives are to promote, encourage, and contribute to the advancement of consumer education and to the resolution of consumer problems. All organizations listed are entitled to vote upon the nominees. The list will include organizations representing the public interest, consumer advocacy groups, and consumer/health branches of Federal, State, and local governments. Any organization that meets the criteria may be included on such list on request.</P>
              <P>(4) The executive secretary, or other designated agency employee, will review the list of nominees and select three to five qualified nominees to be placed on a ballot. Names not selected will remain on a list of eligible nominees and be reviewed periodically by the Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff to determine continued interest. Upon selection of the nominees to be placed on the ballot, the curriculum vitae for each of the nominees will be sent to each of the organizations on the list complied under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, together with a ballot to be filled out and returned within 30 days. After the time for return of the ballots has expired, the ballots will be counted and the nominee who has received the highest number of votes will be selected as the nonvoting member representing consumer interests for that particular advisory committee or subcommittee. In the event of a tie, the Commissioner will select the winner by lot from among those tied for the highest number of votes</P>
              <P>(5) If a member representing consumer interests resigns or is removed before termination of the committee on which the member is serving, the following procedures will be used to appoint a replacement to serve out the term of the former member:</P>

              <P>(i) The Commissioner will appoint the runner-up, in order of number of ballots received, on the original ballot submitted under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to fill the vacancy. If the <PRTPAGE P="240"/>runner-up is no longer willing to serve as a member, then the next runner-up will be appointed.</P>
              <P>(ii) If none of the nominees on the original ballot is willing to serve, or if there was only one nominee on the original ballot, the Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff will contact by telephone eligible individuals whose names have been submitted in the past as candidates for membership as representatives of consumer interests. A list of persons who are interested in serving on an advisory committee will then be prepared. The curricula vitae of these persons, together with a ballot, will be sent to a representative number of consumer organizations that have been determined to be eligible to vote for consumer representatives in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. After 4 days have elapsed, the Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff will contact the consumer organizations by telephone and elicit their votes. The candidate who has received the highest number of votes will be selected. In the event of a tie, the Commissioner will select the winner by lot from among those tied for the highest number of votes.</P>
              <P>(d) To select a nonvoting member to represent industry interests, the Commissioner will publish, for each committee for which the Commissioner has determined to appoint a nonvoting member, a notice requesting that, within 30 days, any industry organization interested in participating in the selection of an appropriate nonvoting member to represent industry interests send a letter stating that interest to the FDA employee designated in the notice. After 30 days, a letter will be sent to each organization that has expressed an interest, attaching a complete list of all such organizations, and stating that it is their responsibility to consult with each other in selecting, within 60 days after receipt of the letter, a single nonvoting member to represent industry interests for that committee. If no individual is selected within 60 days, the Commissioner will select the nonvoting member representing industry interests.</P>
              <P>(e) The Commissioner has determined that, because nonvoting members representing consumer and industry interests are included on advisory committees specifically for the purpose of representing such interests and have no vote, any financial interest covered by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) in the class which the member represents is irrelevant to the services the Government expects from them and thus is hereby exempted under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) as too remote and inconsequential to affect the integrity of their services.</P>

              <P>(2) A nonvoting member who is a representative of industry interest may have access to data and information that constitute a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in § 20.61 only if the person has been appointed as a special Government employee under § 14.80(b).</P>
              <P>(b) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee is subject to, and shall abide by, all rules and regulations adopted by FDA and the committee.</P>

              <P>(1) A nonvoting member does not represent any particular organization or group, but rather represents all interested persons within the class which the member is selected to represent. Accordingly, an interested person within the class represented by that nonvoting member may, upon request, have access to all written statements or oral briefings concerning the committee prepared by the nonvoting <PRTPAGE P="241"/>member for distribution to any person outside the committee. When documents are prepared with non-Government funds, persons desiring copies may be required to pay a reasonable fee to cover printing and similar costs.</P>

              <P>(4) A nonvoting industry member represents all members of the industry, and not any particular association, company, product, or ingredient. If a matter comes before the committee that directly or indirectly affects the company employing the nonvoting industry member, the member shall so inform the committee but need not be absent during the discussion or decline to participate in the discussion. a nonvoting industry member may not discuss the company's position as such, but may discuss any matter in general terms. All presentations and discussions of scientific data and their interpretation on behalf of a company will occur in open session, except as provided in § 14.25(c).</P>
              <P>(5) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee may not make any presentation to that advisory committee during a hearing conducted by that committee.</P>
              <P>(6) Although a nonvoting member serves in a representative capacity, the nonvoting member shall exercise restraint in performing such functions and may not engage in unseemly advocacy or attempt to exert undue influence over the other members of the committee.</P>
              <P>(d) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee may be removed by the Commissioner for failure to comply with this section as well as § 14.80(f).</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section, all voting advisory committee members shall, and nonvoting members may, be appointed as special Government employees and receive a consultant fee and be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, unless such compensation and reimbursement are waived.</P>
              <P>(2) Members of the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) are not appointed as special Government employees. Any member of TEPRSSC who is not a Federal employee or member of the uniformed services, including the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, shall receive a consultant fee and be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, unless such compensation and reimbursement are waived.</P>
              <P>(3) Voting and nonvoting advisory committee members who are members of the uniformed services, including the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, provide service on Food and Drug Administration advisory committees as part of their assigned functions, are not appointed as special government employees, but are reimbursed by the Food and Drug Administration for travel expenses.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding the member's primary residence, an advisory committee member, while attending meetings of the full committee or a subcommittee, will be paid whether the meetings are held in the Washington, DC, area or elsewhere.</P>

              <P>(c) A committee member who participates in any agency-directed assignment will be paid at an hourly rate when doing assigned work at home, a place of business, or in an FDA facility located within the member's commuting area, and at a daily rate when <PRTPAGE P="242"/>required to travel outside of that commuting area to perform the assignment. A committee member will not be paid for time spent on normal preparation for a committee meeting.</P>
              <P>(1) An agency-directed assignment is an assignment that meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) An activity that requires undertaking a definitive study. The activity must produce a tangible end product, usually a written report. Examples are:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) An analysis of the risks and benefits of the use of a class of drugs or a report on a specific problem generated by an IND or NDA;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The performance of similar investigations or analysis of complex industry submissions to support advisory committee deliberations other than normal meeting preparation;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The preparation of a statistical analysis leading to an estimate of toxicologically safe dose levels; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) The design or analysis of animal studies of toxicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.</P>
              <P>(ii) The performance of an IND or NDA review or similar review.</P>
              <P>(2) A committee member who undertakes a special assignment, the end product of which does not represent the end product of the advisory committee, but rather of the committee member's own assignment, can be compensated. Should this preparatory work by members collectively result in an end product of the committee, this is to be considered normal meeting preparation and committee members are not to be compensated for this work.</P>
              <P>(d) Salary while in travel status is authorized when a committee member's ordinary pursuits are interrupted for the substantial portion of an additional day beyond the day or days spent in performing those services, and as a consequence the committee member loses some regular compensation. This applies on weekends and holidays if the special Government employee loses income that would otherwise be earned on that day. For travel purposes, a substantial portion of a day is defined as 50 percent of the working day, and the traveler will be paid at a daily rate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishment of a color additive advisory committee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Commissioner will establish a color additive advisory committee under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(a) The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it would be in the public interest for a color additive advisory committee to review and make recommendations about the safety of a color additive on which important issues are pending before FDA and for interested persons to present information and views at an oral public hearing before a color additive advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(b) There is an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&amp;C Act concerning the safety of a color additive, including its potential or actual carcinogenicity, that requires the exercise of scientific judgment and a person who would be adversely affected by the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a regulation listing a color additive requests that the matter, or the Commissioner as a matter of discretion determines that the matter should, be referred to a color additive advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(1) Paragraph (b) does not apply to any issue arising under the transitional provisions in section 203 of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960 relating to provisional listing of commercially established colors. A color additive advisory committee to consider any such matter will be established under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) A request for establishment of a color additive advisory committee is to be made in accordance with § 10.30. The Commissioner may deny any petition if inadequate grounds are stated for establishing a color additive advisory committee. A request for establishment of a color additive advisory committee may not rest on mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires scientific judgment and justifies a hearing before a color additive advisory committee. When it conclusively appears from the request for a <PRTPAGE P="248"/>color additive advisory committee that the matter is premature or that it does not involve an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&amp;C Act or that there is no genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring scientific judgment, or for any other reason a color additive advisory committee is not justified, the Commissioner may deny the establishment of a color additive advisory committee.</P>
              <P>(3) Establishment of a color additive advisory committee on the request of an interested person is conditioned upon receipt of the application fee specified in § 14.155.</P>
              <P>(4) Any person adversely affected may request referral of the matter to a color additive advisory committee at any time before, or within 30 days after, publication of an order of the Commissioner acting upon a color additive petition or proposal.</P>

              <P>(a) A color additive advisory committee reviews all available information relating to the matter referred to it, including all information contained in any pertinent color additive petition and in FDA files. All information reviewed is placed on public display and is available for review at the office of the Division of Dockets Management.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner specifies to the color additive advisory committee, in writing, the issues on which review and recommendations are requested.</P>
              <P>(c) The date of the first meeting of a color additive advisory committee, following receipt of the administrative record by each of the committee members, is designated as the beginning of the period allowed for consideration of the matter by the committee. Within 60 days after the first meeting, unless the time is extended as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Chairperson of the committee shall certify to the Commissioner the report containing the recommendations of the committee, including any minority report. The report states the recommendations of the committee and the reasons or basis for them. The report includes copies of all material considered by the committee in addition to the administrative record furnished to it.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Chairperson concludes that the color additive advisory committee needs additional time, the Chairperson shall so inform the Commissioner in writing and may certify the report of the committee to the Commissioner within 90 days instead of 60 days.</P>
              <P>(e) More than one matter may be handled concurrently by a color additive advisory committee.</P>

              <P>(a) A color additive advisory committee is subject to all the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this part.</P>
              <P>(b) All interested persons have a right to consult with the color additive advisory committee reviewing a matter and to submit information and views to a color additive advisory committee, in accordance with the procedures in this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Membership of a color additive advisory committee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The members of a color additive advisory committee are selected in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) If a color additive advisory committee is established for purposes that do not include review of an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the act, or is established on the initiative of the Commissioner, the Commissioner may use the procedure in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to select the members or may use an existing standing advisory committee listed in § 14.100, or may establish a new advisory committee under this subpart. Once the Commissioner has established a color additive advisory committee under this paragraph and has referred to it a matter relating to a color additive, no interested person may subsequently request that an additional or different color additive advisory committee be established to review and make recommendations about that color additive.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Commissioner established a color additive advisory committee to review an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&amp;C Act on the request of an interested person, it shall <PRTPAGE P="249"/>be established under the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, the Commissioner will request the National Academy of Sciences to select the members of a color additive advisory committee from among experts qualified in the subject matter to be reviewed by the committee, and of adequately diversified professional backgrounds. The Commissioner will appoint one of the members as the Chairperson.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the National Academy of Sciences is unable or refuses to select the members of a color additive advisory committee, the Commissioner will select the members.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Commissioner and the requesting party agree, section 721(b)(5)(D) of the FD&amp;C Act may be waived and the matter may be referred to any standing advisory committee listed in § 14.100 or to any advisory committee established under any other procedure that is mutually agreeable. Once the Commissioner has established a color additive advisory committee and has referred to it a matter relating to a color additive, no interested person may subsequently request that an additional or different color additive advisory committee be established to review and make recommendations about that color additive.</P>
              <P>(b) Members of a color additive advisory committee are subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this subpart, except that no member of a color additive advisory committee may by reason of such membership alone be a special government employee or be subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 14.155</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Fees and compensation pertaining to a color additive advisory committee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When a matter is referred to a color additive advisory committee, all related costs, including personal compensation of committee members, travel, materials, and other costs, are borne by the person requesting the referral, such costs to be assessed on the basis of actual cost to the government. The compensation of such costs includes personal compensation of committee members at a rate not to exceed $128.80 per member per day.</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a request for referral to a color additive advisory committee, a special advance deposit is to be made in the amount of $2,500. Where required, further advances in increments of $2,500 each are to be made upon request of the Commissioner. All deposits for referrals to a color additive advisory committee in excess of actual expenses will be refunded to the depositor.</P>
              <P>(c) All deposits and fees required by this section are to be paid by money order, bank draft, or certified check drawn to the order of the Food and Drug Administration, collectible at par in Washington, DC. All deposits and fees are to be forwarded to the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, and after appropriate record of them is made, they will be transmitted to the Treasurer of the United States for deposit in the special account “Salaries and Expenses, Certification, Inspection, and Other Services, Food and Drug Administration.”</P>
              <P>(d) The Commissioner may waive or refund such fees in whole or in part when, in the Commissioner's judgment, such action will promote the public interest. Any person who believes that payment of these fees will be a hardship may petition the Commissioner under § 10.30 to waive or refund the fees.</P>

              <P>(a) Generally on the safety and effectiveness, including the labeling and advertising, and regulatory control of the human prescription drugs falling within the pharmacologic class covered by <PRTPAGE P="250"/>the advisory committee and on the scientific standards appropriate for a determination of safety and effectiveness in that class of drugs.</P>

              <P>(1) A particular IND study may properly be conducted;</P>
              <P>(2) A particular drug meets the statutory standard for proof of safety and effectiveness necessary for approval or continued approval for marketing; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Utilization of an advisory committee on the initiative of FDA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any matter involving a human prescription drug under review within the agency may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be the subject of a public hearing and continuing or periodic review by the appropriate standing technical advisory committee for human prescription drugs. The Commissioner's determinations on the agenda of the committee are based upon the priorities of the various matters pending before the agency which fall within the pharmacologic class covered by that committee.</P>
              <P>(b) High priority for such hearing and review by the appropriate standing technical advisory committee for human prescription drugs are given to the following types of human prescription drugs:</P>
              <P>(1) Investigational drugs which are potential therapeutic advances over currently marketed products from the standpoint of safety or effectiveness, or which pose significant safety hazards, or which present narrow benefit-risk considerations requiring a close judgmental decision on approval for marketing, or which have a novel delivery system or formulation, or which are the subject of major scientific or public controversy, or which may be subject to special regulatory requirements such as a limitation on clinical trials, a patient followup requirement, postmarketing Phase IV studies, distributional controls, or boxed warnings.</P>
              <P>(2) Marketed drugs for which an important new use has been discovered or which pose newly discovered safety hazards, or which are the subject of major scientific or public controversy, or which may be subject to important regulatory actions such as withdrawal of approval for marketing, boxed warnings, distributional controls, or newly required scientific studies.</P>
              <P>(c) The committee may request the Commissioner for an opportunity to hold a public hearing and to review any matter involving a human prescription drug which falls within the pharmacologic class covered by the committee. The Commissioner may, after consulting with the committee on such request, grant or deny the request in light of the priorities of the other matters pending before the committee. Whenever feasible, consistent with the other work of the committee, the request will be granted.</P>
              <P>(d) For a drug that meets any of the criteria established in paragraph (b) of this section, one or more members of or consultants to the appropriate advisory committee may be selected for more detailed monitoring of the matter and consultation with FDA on behalf of the committee. The member or consultant may be invited to attend appropriate meetings and shall assist the center in any briefing of the committee on that matter.</P>
              <P>(e) An advisory committee may obtain advice and recommendations from other agency advisory committees, consultants, and experts which the advisory committee and the center conclude would facilitate the work of the advisory committee.</P>

              <P>(f) Presentation of all relevant information about the matter will be made in open session unless it relates to an IND the existence of which has not previously been disclosed to the public as defined in § 20.81 or is otherwise prohibited from public disclosure under part 20 and the regulations referenced therein. Sections 314.430 and 601.51 determine whether, and the extent to which, relevant information may be made available for public disclosure, summarized and discussed in open session but not otherwise made available for public <PRTPAGE P="251"/>disclosure, or not in any way discussed or disclosed in open session or otherwise disclosed to the public.</P>

If the public interest requires, e.g., a hearing is to be conducted within a short period of time or is to be primarily attended by individuals without an organizational affiliation, the notice may name a specific FDA employee and telephone number to whom an oral notice of participation may be given or provide for submitting notices of participation at the time of the hearing. A written or oral notice of participation must be received by the designated person by the close of business of the day specified in the notice.</P>

              <P>(e) The hearing schedule will state whether participants must be present by a specified time to be sure to be heard in case the absence of participants advances the schedule.</P>

A person may be accompanied by any number of additional persons, and may present any written information or views for inclusion in the record of the hearing, subject to the requirements of § 15.25. The presiding officer may allot additional time to any person when the officer concludes that it is in the public interest, but may not reduce the time allotted for any person without the consent of the person.</P>
              <P>(d) If a person is not present at the time specified for the presentation, the persons following will appear in order, with adjustments for those appearing at their scheduled time. An attempt will be made to hear any person who is late at the conclusion of the hearing. Other interested persons attending the hearing who did not request an opportunity to make an oral presentation will be given an opportunity to make an oral presentation at the conclusion of the hearing, in the discretion of the presiding officer, to the extent that time permits.</P>
              <P>(e) The presiding officer and any other persons serving on a panel may question any person during or at the conclusion of the presentation. No other person attending the hearing may question a person making a presentation. The presiding officer may, as a matter of discretion, permit questions to be submitted to the presiding officer or panel for response by them or by persons attending the hearing.</P>
              <P>(f) The hearing is informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views may be made or considered, but other participants may comment upon or rebut all such information and views. No participant may interrupt the presentation of another participant at any hearing for any reason.</P>
              <P>(g) The hearing may end early only if all persons scheduled for a later presentation have already appeared or it is past the time specified in the hearing schedule, under § 15.21(e), by which participants must be present.</P>
              <P>(h) The Commissioner or the presiding officer may, under § 10.19, suspend, modify, or waive any provision of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) A person offered an opportunity for a hearing has the amount of time specified in the notice, which may not be less than 3 working days after receipt of the notice, within which to request a hearing. The request may be filed by mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any other mode of written communication, addressed to the designated FDA employee. If no response is filed within that time, the offer is deemed to have been refused and no hearing will be held.</P>
              <P>(c) If a hearing is requested, the Commissioner will designate a presiding officer, and the hearing will take place at a time and location agreed upon by the party requesting the hearing, the FDA, and the presiding officer or, if agreement cannot be reached, at a reasonable time and location designated by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(d) A notice of opportunity for hearing under this section will not operate to delay or stay any administrative action, including enforcement action by the agency unless the Commissioner, as a matter of discretion, determines that delay or a stay is in the public interest.</P>

A hearing to consider action already taken, and not stayed by the Commissioner, will be conducted on an expedited basis.</P>

This information may be given orally or in writing, in the discretion of FDA.</P>
              <P>(g) FDA and the party requesting the hearing will, if feasible, at least 1 day before the hearing provide to each other written notice of any published articles or written information to be presented at or relied on at the hearing.

              <P>(a) An FDA employee to whom the Commissioner delegates such authority, or any other agency employee designated by an employee to whom such authority is delegated, or, consistent with 5 CFR 930.209(b) or (c), an administrative law judge to whom such authority is delegated, may serve as the presiding officer and conduct a regulatory hearing under this part.</P>

              <P>(b) In a regulatory hearing required by the act or a regulation, the presiding officer is to be free from bias or prejudice and may not have participated in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing or be subordinate to a person, other than the Commissioner, who has participated in such investigation or action.<PRTPAGE P="258"/>

              <P>(c)(1) The Commissioner or the delegate under § 16.40 is not precluded by this section from prior participation in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing.

Thus, if the Commissioner's authority to make a final decision has been delegated to a center director, the presiding officer may be an official in another center or the office of the Commissioner. The exercise of general supervisory responsibility, or the designation of the presiding officer, does not constitute prior participation in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing so as to preclude the Commissioner or delegate from designating a subordinate as the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(2) The party requesting a hearing may make a written request to have the Commissioner or the delegate under § 16.40 be the presiding officer, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

              <P>(b) Those persons who are directly involved in the investigation or presentation of the position of FDA or any party at a regulatory hearing that is required by the act or a regulation should avoid any off-the-record communication on the matter to the presiding officer or the Commissioner or their advisors if the communication is inconsistent with the requirement of § 16.95(b)(1) that the administrative record be the exclusive record for decision.

              <SUBJECT>Hearing procedure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A regulatory hearing is public, except when the Commissioner determines that all or part of a hearing should be closed to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; to prevent the disclosure of a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information that is not available for public disclosure under § 20.61; or to protect investigatory records complied for law enforcement purposes that are not available for public disclosure under § 20.64.</P>
              <P>(1) The Commissioner may determine that a regulatory hearing is closed either on the Commissioner's initiative or on a request by the party asking for a regulatory hearing, in the request for the hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) If the hearing is a private hearing, no persons other than the party requesting the hearing, counsel and witnesses, and an employee or consultant or other person subject to a commercial arrangement as defined in § 20.81(a) and FDA representatives with a direct professional interest in the subject matter of the proceeding are entitled to attend.</P>

              <P>(b) A regulatory hearing will be conducted by a presiding officer. Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement of the action which is the subject of the hearing, together with the information and reasons supporting it, and may present any oral or written information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the hearing may then present any oral or written information relevant to the hearing. All parties may confront and conduct reasonable cross-<PRTPAGE P="259"/>examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) The hearing is informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but any other party may comment upon or rebut all such data, information, and views.</P>
              <P>(d) The presiding officer may order the hearing to be transcribed. The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing transcribed, at the party's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will be included with the presiding officer's report of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(e) The presiding officer shall prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. Whenever time permits, the parties to the hearing will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the presiding officer's report of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(f) The presiding officer shall include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and shall include a recommended decision, with a statement of reasons, unless the Commissioner directs otherwise.</P>
              <P>(g) The presiding officer has the power to take such actions and make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and to conduct a fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce the requirements of this part concerning the conduct of hearings. The presiding officer may direct that the hearing be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and these regulations.</P>

            <P>(b) A ruling of the presiding officer is subject to interlocutory appeal to the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) if the presiding officer certifies on the record or in writing that immediate review is necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice to any participant, or substantial harm to the public interest.</P>
            <P>(c) When an interlocutory appeal is made, a participant may file a brief on the appeal only if specifically authorized by the presiding officer or the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB), and if such authorization is granted, only within the period allowed by the presiding officer or the entity deciding the appeal.

            <P>(b)(1) If a party objects to the proposed admission of evidence not exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the presiding officer will exclude such evidence if he or she determines that the failure to comply with paragraph (a) of this section should result in its exclusion.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless the presiding officer finds that extraordinary circumstances justified the failure to make a timely exchange of witness lists under paragraph (a) of this section, he or she must exclude from the party's hearing evidence the testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the witness list.</P>
            <P>(3) If the presiding officer finds that extraordinary circumstances existed, the presiding officer must then determine whether the admission of the testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the witness lists exchanged under paragraph (a) of this section would cause substantial prejudice to the objecting party. If the presiding officer finds that there is not substantial prejudice, the evidence may be admitted. If the presiding officer finds that there is substantial prejudice, the presiding officer may exclude the evidence, or at his or her discretion, may postpone the hearing for such time as is necessary for the objecting party to prepare and respond to the evidence.</P>
            <P>(c) Unless a party objects within 5 days prior to the hearing, documents exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section will be deemed to be authentic for the purpose of admissibility at the hearing.</P>

            <P>(c) When a party fails to comply with a discovery order, including discovery and subpoena provisions of this part, the presiding officer may:</P>
            <P>(1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought;</P>

            <P>(d) The presiding officer may exclude from participation in the hearing any legal counsel, party, or witness who refuses to obey an order of the presiding officer. In the case of repeated refusal, the presiding officer may grant judgment to the opposing party.</P>
            <P>(e) If a party fails to prosecute or defend an action under this part after service of a notice of hearing, the presiding officer may dismiss the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties and assessments.</P>

            <P>(b) Direct testimony shall be admitted in the form of a written declaration submitted under penalty of perjury. Any such written declaration must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of the witness. Any prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing shall be exchanged as provided in § 17.25(a).</P>
            <P>(c) The presiding officer shall exercise reasonable control over the manner and order of questioning witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:</P>
            <P>(1) Make the examination and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth;</P>
            <P>(2) Avoid undue consumption of time; and</P>
            <P>(3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</P>
            <P>(d) The presiding officer shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the facts.</P>
            <P>(e) At the discretion of the presiding officer, a witness may be cross-examined on relevant matters without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the presiding officer, a witness may be cross-examined on relevant matters with regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the presiding officer, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</P>
            <P>(f) Upon motion of any party, the presiding officer may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of the other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:</P>
            <P>(1) A party who is an individual;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party designated to be the party's sole representative for purposes of the hearing; or</P>

            <P>(g) If a witness' testimony is submitted in writing prior to cross-examination, the cross-examining party need not subpoena the witness or pay <PRTPAGE P="270"/>for his or her travel to the hearing. The sponsoring party is responsible for producing the witness at its own expense, and failure to do so shall result in the striking of the witness' testimony.</P>

            <P>(c) The presiding officer shall exclude evidence that is not relevant or material.</P>
            <P>(d) Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</P>
            <P>(e) Relevant evidence may be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law.</P>
            <P>(f) Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in settling or attempting to settle a civil money penalty assessment which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the civil money penalty or its amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in settlement negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of settlement negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness or opposing a contention of undue delay.</P>

            <P>(d) The opposing party may file a brief of no greater length than that allowed for the posthearing brief in opposition to exceptions within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and accompanying brief, unless such time period is extended by the Commissioner or the entity designated by the Commissioner to hear appeals on request of the opposing party for good cause <PRTPAGE P="272"/>shown. Any brief in opposition to exceptions shall be filed with the Division of Dockets Management and the DAB (addresses above).</P>
            <P>(e) The appellant may file a reply brief not more than 10 pages in length within 10 days of being served with appellee's brief.</P>
            <P>(f) There is no right to appear personally before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB).</P>
            <P>(g) The entity deciding the appeal will consider only those issues raised before the presiding officer, except that the appellee may make any argument based on the record in support of the initial decision or decision granting summary decision.</P>
            <P>(h) If on appeal the entity deciding the appeal considers issues not adequately briefed by the parties, the entity may ask for additional briefing. However, no such additional briefs will be considered unless so requested.</P>
            <P>(i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) that additional evidence not presented at the hearing is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing, the entity deciding the appeal may remand the matter to the presiding officer for consideration of the additional evidence.</P>
            <P>(j) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) will issue a decision on the appeal within 60 days, if practicable, of the due date for submission of the appellee's brief. In the decision, the entity deciding the appeal may decline to review the case, affirm the initial decision or decision granting summary decision (with or without an opinion), or reverse the initial decision or decision granting summary decision, or increase, reduce, reverse, or remand any civil money penalty determined by the presiding officer in the initial decision. If the entity deciding the appeal declines to review the case, the initial decision or the decision granting summary decision shall constitute the final decision of FDA and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after the declination by the entity deciding the appeal.</P>
            <P>(k) The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether the initial decision is supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the initial decision is erroneous.</P>

                <P>Any person in Government service should:</P>
                <P>1. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.</P>
                <P>2. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.</P>
                <P>3. Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.</P>
                <P>4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.</P>
                <P>5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.</P>
                <P>6. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.</P>
                <P>7. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.</P>
                <P>8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.</P>
                <P>9. Expose corruption wherever discovered.</P>
                <P>10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.</P>

The Director, Division of Ethics and Program Integrity, Office of Management and Operations, shall serve as executive secretary of the Review Board.</P>
              <P>(b) It shall be the responsibility of every Food and Drug Administration employee with whom any specific or policy issue relating to conflicts of interest is raised, or who otherwise wishes to have any such matter resolved, to forward the matter to the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations for resolution, except that reporting of apparent violations of law are governed by § 19.21.</P>
              <P>(c) All general policy relating to conflicts of interest shall be established in guidance documents pursuant to the provisions of § 10.90(b) of this chapter and whenever feasible shall be incorporated in regulations in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) All decisions relating to specific individuals shall be placed in a public file established for this purpose by the Division of Freedom of Information, e.g., a determination that a consultant may serve on an advisory committee with specific limitations or with public disclosure of stock holdings, except that such determination shall be written in a way that does not identify the individual in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(1) A determination that an employee must dispose of prohibited financial interests or refrain from incompatible outside activities in accordance with established Department or agency regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) A determination that a proposed consultant is not eligible for employment by the agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy on disclosure of Food and Drug Administration records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration will make the fullest possible disclosure of records to the public, consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy, the property rights of persons in trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information, and the need for the agency to promote frank internal policy deliberations and to pursue its regulatory activities without disruption.</P>
              <P>(b) Except where specifically exempt pursuant to the provisions of this part, all Food and Drug Administration records shall be made available for public disclosure.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all nonexempt records shall be made available for public disclosure upon request regardless whether any justification or need for such records have been shown.</P>
              <P>(d) Under § 21.71 of this chapter, a statement of the purposes to which the record requested is to be put, and a certification that the record will be so used, may be requested when:</P>
              <P>(1) The requested record is contained in a Privacy Act Record System as defined in § 21.3(c) of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(2) The requester is a person other than the individual who is the subject of the record that is so retrieved or a person acting on his behalf; and</P>
              <P>(3) The disclosure is one that is discretionary, i.e., not required under this part.</P>
              <P>(e) “Record” and any other term used in this section in reference to information includes any information that would be an agency record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the agency in any format, including an electronic format.</P>

              <P>Any record of the Food and Drug Administration that is disclosed in an authorized manner to any member of the public is available for disclosure to all members of the public, except that:</P>
              <P>(a) Data and information subject to the exemptions established in § 20.61 for trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information, and in § 20.63 for personal privacy, shall be disclosed only to the persons for the protection of whom these exemptions exist.</P>

              <P>(b) The limited disclosure of records permitted in § 7.87(c) of this chapter for <PRTPAGE P="278"/>section 305 hearing records, in § 20.80(b) regarding certain limitations on exemptions, in § 20.103(b) for certain correspondence, and in § 20.104(b) for certain summaries of oral discussions, shall be subject to the special rules stated therein.</P>
              <P>(c) Disclosure of a record about an individual, as defined in § 21.3(a) of this chapter, that is retrieved by the individual's name or other personal identifier and is contained in a Privacy Act Record System, as defined in § 21.3(c) of this chapter, shall be subject to the special requirements of part 21 of this chapter. Disclosure of such a record to an individual who is the subject of the record does not invoke the rule established in this section that such records shall be made available for disclosure to all members of the public.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Whenever information is deleted from a record that contains both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the portion of the record that is made available, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

              <P>(a) All time limitations prescribed pursuant to this section shall begin as of the time at which a request for records is logged in by the Division of Freedom of Information pursuant to § 20.40(c). An oral request for records <PRTPAGE P="281"/>shall not begin any time requirement. A written request for records sent elsewhere within the agency shall not begin any time requirement until it is redirected to the Division of Freedom of Information and is logged in there in accordance with § 20.40(c).</P>
              <P>(b) Within 20 working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after a request for records is logged in at the Division of Freedom of Information, the agency shall send a letter to the requester providing the agency's determination as to whether, or the extent to which, the agency will comply with the request, and, if any records are denied, the reasons for the denial.</P>
              <P>(1) If all of the records requested have been located and a final determination has been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the letter shall so state.</P>
              <P>(2) If all of the records have not been located or a final determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, e.g., because it is necessary to consult the person affected pursuant to § 20.47, the letter shall state the extent to which the records involved shall be disclosed pursuant to the rules established in this part.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) In unusual circumstances, the agency may extend the time for sending the letter for an additional period.</P>
              <P>(A) The agency may provide for an extension of up to 10 working days by providing written notice to the requester setting out the reasons for the extension and the date by which a determination is expected to be sent.</P>
              <P>(B) The agency may provide for an extension of more than 10 working days by providing written notice to the requester setting out the reasons for the extension. The notice also will give the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed in a shorter time and/or an opportunity to agree on a timeframe longer than the 10 extra working days for processing the request.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unusual circumstances may exist under any of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(A) There is a need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other components that are separate from the agency component responsible for processing the request;</P>
              <P>(B) There is a need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or</P>
              <P>(C) There is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the Food and Drug Administration having substantial subject-matter interest in the determination.</P>
              <P>(4) If any record is denied, the letter shall state the right of the person requesting such records to appeal any adverse determination to the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 5.34.</P>
              <P>(c) The Food and Drug Administration shall provide a determination of whether to provide expedited processing within 10 calendar days of receipt by the Division of Freedom of Information of the request and the required documentation of compelling need in accordance with § 20.44(b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Expedited processing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration will provide expedited processing of a request for records when the requester demonstrates a compelling need, or in other cases as determined by the agency. A compelling need exists when:</P>
              <P>(1) A failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, there is a demonstrated urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
              <P>(b) A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be made by the specific individual who is subject to an imminent threat, or by a family member, medical or health care professional, or other authorized representative of the individual, and must demonstrate a reasonable basis for concluding that failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose a specific and identifiable imminent threat to the life or safety of the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must demonstrate that:</P>
              <P>(1) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the general public and not merely to a narrow interest group;</P>
              <P>(2) There is an urgent need for the requested information and that it has a particular value that will be lost if not obtained and disseminated quickly; however, a news media publication or broadcast deadline alone does not qualify as an urgent need, nor does a request for historical information; and</P>
              <P>(3) The request for records specifically concerns identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(d) All requests for expedited processing shall be filed in writing as provided by § 20.40. Each such request shall include information that demonstrates a reasonable basis for concluding that a compelling need exists within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section and a certification that the information provided in the request is true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. Any statements made in support of a request for expedited processing are subject to the False Reports to the Government Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).</P>
              <P>(e) The Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee) will determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing within 10 days of receipt by the Division of Freedom of Information of all information required to make a decision.</P>
              <P>(f) If the agency grants a request for expedited processing, the agency shall process the request as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(g) If the agency denies a request for expedited processing, the agency shall process the request with other nonexpedited requests.</P>

              <P>(h) If the agency denies a request for expedited processing, the requester <PRTPAGE P="283"/>may appeal the agency's decision by writing to the official identified in the denial letter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Categories of requests.</E> Paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section state, for each category of request, the type of fees that the Food and Drug Administration will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in § 20.46 or for other reasons.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request.</E> If the request is for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search, review, and duplication.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and scientific institutions and news media.</E> If the request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other requests.</E> If the request is not the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the search and the duplication. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the first 2 hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> (1) The Food and Drug Administration may charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure or if no records are found.</P>
              <P>(2) If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours are spent on a computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the operator's own operation. If the operator spends less than 2 hours on the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly rate for the operator's time, multiplied by 2.</P>
              <P>(3) If, under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication, then those 100 pages are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages of computer printout. If this method to calculate the fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be reduced by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100.</P>
              <P>(4) No charge will be made if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee.</P>
              <P>(5) If it is determined that a requester (acting either alone or together with others) is breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, all these requests may be aggregated for purposes of calculating the fees charged.</P>
              <P>(6) Interest will be charged on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. Provisions in 45 CFR part 30, the Department of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims collection, will be used in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> The Food and Drug Administration charges the following fees in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services at 45 CFR part 5.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Manual searching for or reviewing of records.</E> When the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-9 through GS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade and step, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. When a search involves employees at more than one of <PRTPAGE P="284"/>these levels, the Food and Drug Administration will charge the rate appropriate for each.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer searching and printing.</E> The actual cost of operating the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Photocopying standard size pages.</E> $0.10 per page. Freedom of Information Officers may charge lower fees for particular documents where:</P>
              <P>(i) The document has already been printed in large numbers;</P>
              <P>(ii) The program office determines that using existing stock to answer this request, and any other anticipated Freedom of Information requests, will not interfere with program requirements; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The Freedom of Information Officer determines that the lower fee is adequate to recover the prorated share of the original printing costs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or blueprints), or reproducing other records (such as tapes).</E> The actual costs of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Certifying that records are true copies.</E> This service is not required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug Administration agrees to provide certification, there is a $10 charge per certification.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Sending records by express mail or other special methods.</E> This service is not required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug Administration agrees to provide this service, the requester will be required to directly pay, or be directly charged by, the courier. The agency will not agree to any special delivery method that does not permit the requester to directly pay or be directly charged for the service.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Performing any other special service in connection with a request to which the Food and Drug Administration has agreed.</E> Actual costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials used, plus charges for the time of the Food and Drug Administration's employees, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for assessing and collecting fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agreement to pay.</E> The Food and Drug Administration generally assumes that a requester is willing to pay the fees charged for services associated with the request. The requester may specify a limit on the amount to be spent. If it appears that the fees will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to proceed with the search.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> If a requester has failed to pay previous bills in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration's initial review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the requester will be required to pay past due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins. In such cases, the requester will be notified promptly upon receipt of the request, and the administrative time limits prescribed in § 20.41 will begin only after there is an agreement with the requester over payment of fees, or a decision that fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Billing and payment.</E> Ordinarily, the requester will be required to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Administration will furnish the records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send the requester a bill along with or following the records. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a history of prompt payment. The Food and Drug Administration may also, at its discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in order to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to businesses or agents representing requesters. For example, the Food and Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month. Fees should be paid in accordance with the instructions furnished by the person who responds to the request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Waiver or reduction of fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Standard.</E> The Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee) <PRTPAGE P="285"/>will waive or reduce the fees that would otherwise be charged if disclosure of the information meets both of the following tests:</P>
              <P>(1) Is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and</P>
              <P>(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Public interest.</E> Disclosure of information satisfies the first test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may further. In analyzing this question, the Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the records to be disclosed pertain to the operations or activities of the Federal Government;</P>
              <P>(2) Whether disclosure of the records would reveal any meaningful information about Government operations or activities that is not already public knowledge;</P>
              <P>(3) Whether disclosure will advance the understanding of the general public as distinguished from a narrow segment of interested persons. Under this factor, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information, and whether the requester's intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information to the public. An unsupported claim to be doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a representative of the news media is better evidence; and</P>
              <P>(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding will be a significant one, i.e., will the public's understanding of the Government's operations be substantially greater as a result of the disclosure.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest.</E> If disclosure passes the test of furthering the specific public interest described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will determine whether disclosure also furthers the requester's commercial interest and, if so, whether this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test, the Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester is acting. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Both profit and nonprofit-making corporations have commercial interests, as well as individuals, unions, and other associations. The interest of a representative of the news media in using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be considered a commercial interest.</P>
              <P>(2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, whether that effect outweighs the advancement of the public interest as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Deciding between waiver and reduction.</E> If the disclosure of the information requested passes both tests described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will normally waive fees. However, in some cases the Food and Drug Administration may decide only to reduce the fees. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this when disclosure of some but not all of the requested records passes the tests.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction.</E> A requester must request a waiver or reduction of fees at the same time as the request for records. The requester should explain why a waiver or reduction is proper under the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Only the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If the Food and Drug Administration does not completely grant the request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate a review official. The requester may appeal the denial to that official. The appeal letter should address reasons for <PRTPAGE P="286"/>the Associate Commissioner's decision that are set forth in the denial letter.</P>

Nonspecific requests or requests for a large number of documents that require the deployment of a substantial amount of agency man-hours to search for and compile will be processed taking into account the staff-hours required, the tasks from which these resources must be diverted, the impact that this diversion will have upon the agency's consumer protection activities, and the public policy reasons justifying the requests. A decision on the processing of such a request for information shall be made after balancing the public benefit to be gained by the disclosure against the public loss that will result from diverting agency personnel from their other responsibilities. In any situation in which it is determined that a request for voluminous records would unduly burden and interfere with the operations of the Food and Drug Administration, the person making the request will be asked to be more specific <PRTPAGE P="287"/>and to narrow the request, and to agree on an orderly procedure for the production of the requested records, in order to satisfy the request without disproportionate adverse effects on agency operations.</P>

If a court requires the Food and Drug Administration to itemize and index such records, the Food and Drug Administration will so inform the person affected and will require that such person undertake the itemization and indexing of the records.

Accordingly, a record that is ordinarily available for public disclosure in accordance with the provisions in subpart F of this part or of another regulation cross-referenced in § 20.100(c) is not available for such disclosure to the extent that it falls within an exemption contained in this subpart, except as provided by the limitations on exemptions specified in subpart E of this part. For example, correspondence that is ordinarily disclosable under § 20.103 is not disclosable to the extent that it contains trade secrets exempt from disclosure under § 20.61 and is not subject to discretionary release under § 20.82.</P>
              <P>(b) Where application of one or more exemptions results in a record being disclosable in part and nondisclosable in part, the rule established in § 20.22 shall apply.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 20.61</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A trade secret may consist of any commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. There must be a direct relationship between the trade secret and the productive process.</P>
              <P>(b) Commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential means valuable data or information which is used in one's business and is of a type customarily held in strict confidence or regarded as privileged and not disclosed to any member of the public by the person to whom it belongs.</P>
              <P>(c) Data and information submitted or divulged to the Food and Drug Administration which fall within the definitions of a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information are not available for public disclosure.</P>
              <P>(d) A person who submits records to the Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt from disclosure under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. The person may make this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must be in writing. Where a legend is required by a request for proposals or request for quotations, pursuant to 48 CFR 352.215-12, then that legend is necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted to the Government.</P>
              <P>(e) The procedures in this paragraph apply to records on which the submitter has designated information as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. These procedures also apply to records that were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration when the agency has substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. Certain exceptions to these procedures are set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) When the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for such records and determines that disclosure may be required, the Food and Drug Administration will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If the Food and Drug Administration must notify a large number of submitters, notification may be done by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it.</P>
              <P>(2) The submitter has 5 working days from receipt of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for its objections.</P>

              <P>(3) The Food and Drug Administration will give consideration to all bases <PRTPAGE P="289"/>that have been stated in a timely manner by the submitter. If the Food and Drug Administration decides to disclose the records, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the submitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why the agency did not sustain the submitter's objections. The Food and Drug Administration will include with the notice a copy of the records about which the submitter objected, as the agency proposes to disclose them. The notice will state that the Food and Drug Administration intends to disclose the records 5 working days after the submitter receives the notice unless a U.S. District Court orders the agency not to release them.</P>
              <P>(4) If a requester files suit under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain records covered by this paragraph, the Food and Drug Administration will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(5) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester that the Food and Drug Administration is giving the submitter a notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester of this fact.</P>
              <P>(f) The notice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section do not apply in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(1) The Food and Drug Administration decided not to disclose the records;</P>
              <P>(2) The information has previously been published or made generally available;</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure is required by a regulation issued after notice and opportunity for public comment, that specifies narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, but in this case a submitter may still designate records as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and in exceptional cases, the Food and Drug Administration may, at its discretion, follow the notice procedures in paragraph (e) of this section;</P>
              <P>(4) The information requested has not been designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure when the submitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the Food and Drug Administration has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or</P>
              <P>(5) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this case the Food and Drug Administration will still give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section (although this notice need not explain our decision or include a copy of the records), and the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preemption.</E> No State or local governing entity shall establish or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that permits or requires disclosure of the identities of the voluntary reporter or other person identified in an adverse event report except as provided in this section.</P>

Accordingly, a record that is ordinarily exempt from public disclosure in accordance with the provisions in subpart D of this part is available for such disclosure to the extent that it falls within a limitation on the exemption contained in this subpart. For example, an investigatory record that is ordinarily exempt from disclosure under § 20.64 is disclosable to Congress in accordance with the provisions of § 20.87.</P>
              <P>(b) Disclosure of a record to any member of the public pursuant to the provisions in § 20.81, data and information previously disclosed to the public, in § 20.82, discretionary disclosure by the Commissioner, and in § 20.83, disclosure pursuant to a court order, shall involve the rule established in § 20.21 that the record shall be made available for disclosure to all members of the public who request it.

              <P>(c) Disclosure to government employees and special government employees of records exempt from public disclosure shall subject those persons to the same restrictions with respect to the disclosure of such records as any Food and Drug Administration employee.</P>
              <P>(d) In the case of a record in a Privacy Act Record System, as defined in § 21.3(c) of this chapter:</P>

              <P>(2) The availability of a record about an individual to persons other than the individual who is the subject of the record shall be subject to the special requirements of part 21, subpart G, of this chapter (restrictions on disclosure in the privacy regulations), and shall not be subject to the limitations on exemptions in this subpart except as provided in part 21, subpart G, of this chapter.</P>

The number of consultants who have received such information shall have been limited to the number reasonably needed to perform that particular consulting service.</P>

The Commissioner shall exercise his discretion to disclose such records whenever he determines that such disclosure is in the public interest, will promote the objectives of the act and the agency, and is consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy, the property rights of persons in trade secrets, and the need for the agency to promote frank internal policy deliberations and to pursue its regulatory activities without disruption.</P>

              <P>(c) Discretionary disclosure of a record pursuant to this section shall invoke the requirement that the record shall be disclosed to any person who requests it pursuant to § 20.21, but shall not set a precedent for discretionary disclosure of any similar or related record and shall not obligate the Commissioner to exercise his discretion to disclose any other record that is exempt from disclosure.</P>

              <P>(a) All Food and Drug Administration records relating to administrative enforcement action disclosed to any member of the public, including the person who is the subject of such action, are available for public disclosure at the time such disclosure is first made. Such records include correspondence with companies following factory inspection, recall or detention requests, notice of refusal of admission of an imported product, regulatory letters, information letters, Forms FD-483 and FD-2275 furnished to companies after factory inspection, and similar records.</P>
              <P>(b) To the extent that any of such records fall within the exemption for investigatory records established in § 20.64, the Commissioner determines that they are subject to discretionary release pursuant to § 20.82.</P>
              <P>(c) Records relating to administrative enforcement action that are not disclosed to any member of the public constitute investigatory records that are subject to the rules for disclosure established in § 20.64. For example, an establishment inspection report is an investigatory record and thus subject to § 20.64 except insofar as the Commissioner exercises his discretion to release it pursuant to § 20.82.</P>

The Food and Drug Administration will make available for public disclosure such records or documents if the agency can determine that it has an accurate copy of the actual record or document filed in the court. If the Food and Drug Administration cannot determine whether it has an accurate copy of such a record or document, the person requesting a copy shall be referred to the court involved.</P>

              <P>(b) After a recommendation for court action has been finally refused by a United States attorney, the correspondence with the United States attorney and the Department of Justice with respect to that recommendation, including the pleadings recommended for filing with the court, is available for public disclosure. Prior to disclosure of any record specifically reflecting consideration of possible criminal prosecution of any individual, all names and other information that would identify an individual who was considered for criminal prosecution but <PRTPAGE P="301"/>who was not prosecuted shall be deleted unless the Commissioner concludes that there is a compelling public interest in the disclosure of such names.</P>

              <P>(1) Apply to Food and Drug Administration record systems that are not Privacy Act Record Systems or make available to an individual records that may include references to him but that are not retrieved by his name or other personal identifier, whether or not contained in a Privacy Act Record System. part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) and other regulations referred to therein determine when records are made available in such cases.</P>
              <P>(2) Make any records available to persons other than (i) individuals who are the subjects of the records, (ii) persons accompanying such individuals under § 21.43, (iii) persons provided records pursuant to individual consent under § 21.72, or (iv) persons acting on behalf of such individuals as legal guardians under § 21.75. Part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) and other regulations referred to therein determine when Food and Drug Administration records are disclosable to members of the public generally. Subpart G of this part limits the provisions of part 20 of this chapter with respect to disclosures of records about individuals from Privacy Act Record Systems to persons other than individuals who are the subjects of the records.</P>
              <P>(3) Make available information compiled by the Food and Drug Administration in reasonable anticipation of court litigation or formal administrative proceedings. The availability of such information to any member of the public, including any subject individual or party to such litigation or proceeding shall be governed by applicable constitutional principles, rules of discovery, and part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations).</P>

              <P>As used in this part:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Individual</E> means a natural living person who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Individual does not include sole proprietorships, partnerships, or corporations engaged in the production or distribution of products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or with which the Food and Drug Administration has business dealings. Any such business enterprise that is identified by the name of one or more individuals is not an individual within the meaning of this part. Employees of regulated business enterprises are considered individuals. Accordingly, physicians and other health professionals who are engaged in business as proprietors of establishments regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are not considered individuals; however, physicians and <PRTPAGE P="308"/>other health professionals who are engaged in clinical investigations, employed by regulated enterprises, or the subjects of records concerning their own health, e.g., exposure to excessive radiation, are considered individuals. Food and Drug Administration employees, consultants, and advisory committee members, State and local officials, and consumers are considered individuals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Records of contractors.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Systems of records that are required to be operated, or as a matter of practical necessity must be operated, by contractors to accomplish Food and Drug Administration functions, from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers, may be subject to the provisions of this part. If the contract is agreed to on or after September 27, 1975, the criminal penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) are applicable to such contractor, and any employee of such contractor, for disclosures prohibited in § 21.71 or for maintenance of a system of records without notice as required in § 21.20.</P>
              <P>(b) A contract is considered to accomplish a Food and Drug Administration function if the proposal or activity it supports is principally operated on behalf of and is under the direct management of the Food and Drug Administration. Systems of records from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers and that are operated under contracts to accomplish Food and Drug Administration functions are deemed to be maintained by the agency and shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) A contract is not considered to accomplish a Food and Drug Administration function if the program or activity it supports is not principally operated on behalf of, or is not under the direct <PRTPAGE P="310"/>management of, the Food and Drug Administration. For example, this part does not apply to systems of records:</P>
              <P>(1) Operated under contract with the Food and Drug Administration by State or local government agencies, or organizations representing such agencies, when such agencies or organizations are also performing State or local government functions.</P>
              <P>(2) Operated by contractors with the Food and Drug Administration by individuals or organizations whose primary function is delivery of health services, such as hospitals, physicians, pharmacists, and other health professionals, and that report information concerning products, e.g., injuries or product defects, to the Food and Drug Administration. Before such contractors submit information to the Food and Drug Administration, the names and other personal identifiers of patients or research subjects in any medical or similar report, test, study, or other research project shall be deleted, unless the contract provides otherwise. If the Food and Drug Administration subsequently needs the names of such individuals, a separate request will be made.</P>
              <P>(3) Relating to individuals whom the contractor employs, or with whom the contractor otherwise deals, in the course of providing goods and services to the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(4) Operated under grants.</P>
              <P>(d) The requirements of this part shall apply when a contractor who operates a system of records not subject to this part reports to the Food and Drug Administration information that is a system of records about individuals from which personal information is retrieved by names or other personal identifiers. Where the information would be a new Privacy Act Record System, or a change in an existing Privacy Act Record System of a type described in § 21.21, the Food and Drug Administration shall comply with the requirements of § 21.21.</P>

              <P>(e) The Food and Drug Administration will review all contracts before award to determine whether operation of a system from which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers will be required of the contractor, by the terms of the contract or as a matter of practical necessity. If such operation will be required, the solicitation and contract shall include the following clause, or a clause of similar effect:

The National Archives and Records Administration shall not disclose the record except to authorized Food and Drug Administration employees.</P>
              <P>(b) Each Food and Drug Administration record pertaining to an identifiable individual that was transferred to the National Archives of the United States as a record determined by the National Archives to have sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation shall be considered to be maintained by the National Archives and shall not be subject to the provisions of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Personnel records.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Present and former Food and Drug Administration employees desiring access to personnel records about themselves should consult system notices applicable to the agency's personnel records that are published by <PRTPAGE P="311"/>the Office of Personnel Management and the Department as well as any notice issued by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The procedures of the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR parts 293, 294, and 297 rather than the procedures in § 21.33 and subparts D through F of this part, govern systems of personnel records about Food and Drug Administration employees that are subject to notice published by the Office of Personnel Management, i.e., systems that:</P>
              <P>(i) The Office of Personnel Management maintains.</P>
              <P>(ii) Are maintained by the Division of Human Resources Management, Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(iii) Are maintained by Department Regional Offices, concerning field employees.</P>

              <P>(2) The Office of Personnel Management's procedures may, if necessary, be supplemented in the Food and Drug Administration Staff Manual Guide. Current Food and Drug Administration employees should mail or deliver written requests under the Privacy Act for access to personnel records described in this paragraph to the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with 5 CFR 297.106, the Director, Division of Human Resources Management HR-BETHPL RM7114, HFA-705, 7700 Wisconsin Ave., 7th &amp; 8th floors, Bethesda, MD 20814, or the personnel officer in the servicing HHS Regional Personnel Office. An employee may consult with or direct his or her request to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator (the Privacy Act Coordinator is part of the Freedom of Information Staff, the address for which is located on the Agency Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>). Requests for access to personnel records of former employees that are located in Federal Records Centers should be directed to the Office of Personnel Management. Requests under the Privacy Act for amendment of personnel records should be directed to these same officials who are responsible for access to personnel records under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(3) With respect to records subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Refusal to grant access to a record, or refusal to amend a record upon request of an employee, shall only be made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Appeals of refusals under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be made to the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with 5 CFR 297.108(g)(3) and 297.113(b).</P>
              <P>(c) Any other Privacy Act Record Systems that contain personnel records, or records that otherwise concern agency employees, that are maintained by offices of the Food and Drug Administration rather than the Division of Human Resources Management but which are not subject to the Department's notice for personnel records in operating offices are subject to this part, except that refusals under this part to grant access to or amend records about present or former employees shall be made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations rather than the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs.</P>
              <P>(d) The following procedures shall govern requests under the Privacy Act for personnel records that are maintained by the operating offices of the Food and Drug Administration in which employees work:</P>
              <P>(1) An employee shall upon request be told whether records about him are maintained. An employee shall be given access to records about himself that are subject to this paragraph in response to an oral or written request and through informal procedures, rather than the procedures specified in §§ 21.40 through 21.43.</P>
              <P>(2) Employee identity may be verified, if necessary, by an FDA ID card rather than in accordance with § 21.44.</P>
              <P>(3) Generally no fee shall be charged for records requested under this paragraph. However, in cases where the records requested are voluminous, a fee may be charged in accordance with § 21.45.</P>

              <P>(4) Records that are subject to this paragraph shall be available for access to an individual, except to the extent that access is refused by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate on the grounds that the record is subject to an exemption under § 21.61 or 5 CFR 297.111.<PRTPAGE P="312"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Requests under the Privacy Act for amendment of records subject to this paragraph should be directed to the Director, Division of Human Resources Management (HFA-400). Such requests shall be reviewed in accordance with subpart E of this part. Refusal to amend a record subject to this paragraph (d)(5) shall only be made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate.</P>
              <P>(6) Appeals of refusals under paragraph (d) (4) or (5) of this section may be made to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, except where the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate indicates with his or her refusal that the appeal should be made to the Office of Personnel Management.</P>

              <P>(1) The agency may review the records to determine whether disclosure of the record to the individual who is the subject of the records might have an adverse effect on him. If it is determined that disclosure is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, the record shall be disclosed to him. If it is determined that disclosure is very likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, he may be requested to designate, in writing, a representative to whom the record shall be disclosed. Such representative may be a physician, other health professional, or other responsible person who would be willing to review the record and discuss it with the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) The availability of the record may be subject to any procedures for disclosure to an individual of medical records about himself under part 20 of this chapter, in addition to or in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (b)(1), that are not inconsistent with § 21.41(f).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for submitting requests for notification and access.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An individual may request that the Food and Drug Administration notify him whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records about him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal identifier. An individual may at the same time, or after receiving notification that such a record about him exists, requests that he be given access to the record.</P>

              <P>(b) An individual desiring notification or access to records shall mail or deliver a request for records in any Food and Drug Administration Privacy Act Records System to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator (address is located on the agency web site at <E T="03">http://www.gov.fda</E>).</P>
              <P>(c) Requests shall be in writing and shall name the Privacy Act Record System or Systems concerning which the individual requests notification of whether there are records about him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal identifier. To help assure a prompt response, an individual should indicate that he is making a “Privacy Act Request” on the envelope and in a prominent manner in the letter.</P>

              <P>(d) An individual who merely wishes to be notified whether a Privacy Act Record System contains a record about him ordinarily need not provide any verification of his identity other than his name. The mere fact that the Food and Drug Administration has a record about an individual in any of its Privacy Act Records Systems would not be likely to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Where mere disclosure of the fact that a record about the individual exists would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, further <PRTPAGE P="313"/>verification of the identity of the individual shall be required.</P>
              <P>(e) An individual who requests that he be given access to a copy of records about himself, if any exist, should indicate whether he prefers (1) to have copies of any such records mailed to him in accordance with § 21.43(a)(1), which may involve a fee under § 21.45, including information to verify his identity under § 21.44 or (2) to use the procedures for access in person under § 21.43(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(f) A request for notification and access may be submitted under this subpart concerning any Privacy Act Record System that is exempt under § 21.61, as indicated in the notice for the system. An individual seeking access to records under § 21.65(b)(2) to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes other than criminal law enforcement purposes should submit a description of the right, benefit, or privilege that he believes he was denied as the result of the Food and Drug Administration's maintenance of the records. Where the system is exempt under § 21.61, and access to the requested records is not granted under § 21.65, the request shall be handled under the provisions of part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations).</P>

              <P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration will determine whether a request by an individual for records about himself is appropriately treated as a request under this subpart, or under the provision of part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations), or both. Where appropriate, the Food and Drug Administration will consult with the individual concerning the appropriate treatment of the request.</P>

              <P>(c) The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in the Division of Freedom of Information (address is located on the agency web site at <E T="03">http://www.gov.fda</E>) shall be responsible for the handling of Privacy Act requests received by the Food and Drug Administration. Requests mailed or delivered to any other office shall be promptly redirected to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator. Where this procedure would unduly delay the agency's response, however, the agency employee who received the request should consult with the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator and obtain advice as to whether the employee can respond to the request directly.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of a request by the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator, a record shall promptly be made that a request has been received and the date.</P>

              <P>(e) A letter in accordance with § 21.42 responding to the request for notification shall issue as promptly as possible after receipt of the request by the Food and Drug Administration. Upon determination by the Division of Freedom of Information  (address is located on the agency web site at <E T="03">http://www.gov.fda</E>) that a request for access to records is appropriately treated as a request under part 20 of this chapter rather than part 21, or under both parts, the time limitations prescribed in § 21.41 shall apply. In any case, access to available records shall be provided as promptly as possible.</P>

              <P>(f) Except as provided in § 21.32, an individual's access to records about him/herself that are retrieved by his/her name or other personal identifiers and contained in any Privacy Act Record System may only be denied by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his or her designate. An individual shall not be denied access to any record that is otherwise available to him/her under this part except on the grounds that it is exempt under § 21.65(a)(2), that it was compiled in reasonable anticipation of court litigation of formal administrative proceedings, or to the extent that it is exempt or prohibited from disclosure because it includes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of another individual.<PRTPAGE P="314"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator shall ensure that records are maintained of the number, status, and disposition of requests under this subpart, including the number of requests for records exempt from access under this subpart and other information required for purposes of the annual report to Congress under the Privacy Act. These temporary administrative management records shall not be considered to be Privacy Act Record Systems. All records required to be kept under this paragraph shall only include requesting individuals' names or personal identifiers for so long as any request for notification, access, or amendment is pending. The identity of individuals making request under this subpart shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be disclosed under part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) to any other person or agency except as is necessary for the processing of requests under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) The FDA shall respond to an individual's request for notification as to whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records about him that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier by sending a letter under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) If there are no records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier in the named Privacy Act Record System, or the requester is not an “individual” under § 21.3(a), the letter shall so state. Where appropriate, the letter shall indicate that the Food and Drug Administration's public information regulations in part 20 of this chapter prescribe general rules governing the availability of information to members of the public, and that a request may be made in accordance with part 20 of this chapter for records that are not retrieved by the requester's name or other personal identifier from a Privacy Act Record System.</P>
              <P>(2) If there are records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier and the named Privacy Act Record System is not exempt from individual access and contest under § 21.61, or the system is exempt but access is allowed or required under § 21.65, the letter shall inform him that the records exist and shall either:</P>
              <P>(i) Enclose a copy of the records under § 21.43(a)(1) or indicate that the records will be sent under separate cover, where there has been adequate verification of the identity of the individual under § 21.44 and the fees under § 21.45 do not exceed $25, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Inform the individual of the procedures to obtain access to the records by mail or in person under § 21.43(a)(2), as well as the approximate dates by which the requested records can be provided (if the records are not then available), the locations at which access in person may be had, and the information needed, if any, to verify the identity of the individual under § 21.44.</P>
              <P>(3) If the named Privacy Act Record System contains records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier, and the system is exempt from individual access and contest under § 21.61 and access is not allowed or required under § 21.65, the letter should inform him that the records are exempted from access and contest by § 21.61. The letter shall also inform him if the records sought are not available because they were compiled in reasonable anticipation of court litigation or formal administrative proceedings or are otherwise not available under § 21.41(b). Where appropriate, the letter shall also indicate whether the records are available under part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations), and it may disclose the records in accordance with part 20.</P>

              <P>(4) If the named Privacy Act Record System contains records about the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier, but a final determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records covered by the request, e.g., because it is necessary to consult another person or agency having an interest in the confidentiality of the records, the letter shall explain the circumstances and indicate when a final answer will be given.<PRTPAGE P="315"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in § 21.32, access to a record may only be denied by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his or her designate. If access to any record is denied wholly or in substantial part, the letter shall state the right of the individual to appeal to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.</P>
              <P>(c) If a request for a copy of the records will result in a fee of more than $25, the letter shall specify or estimate the fee involved. Where the individual has requested a copy of any records about him and copying the records would result in a fee of over $50, the Food and Drug Administration shall require advance deposit as well as payment of any amount not yet received as a result of any previous request by the individual for a record about himself, under this subpart or part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations) before the records are made available. If the fee is less than $50, prepayment shall not be required unless payment has not yet been received for records disclosed as a result of a previous request by the individual for a record about himself under this subpart or part 20 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(1) Mailing a copy of the records to the requesting individual, or</P>

              <P>(2) Permitting the requesting individual to review the records in person between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. at the office of the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator, at the Division of Freedom of Information Public Reading Room (address is located on the agency's web site at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>), or at any Food and Drug Administration field office, listed in part 5, subpart M of this chapter, or at another location or time upon which the Food and Drug Administration and the individual agree. Arrangement for such review can be made by consultation between the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator and the individual. An individual seeking to review records in person shall generally be permitted access to the file copy, except that where the records include nondisclosable information, a copy shall be made of that portion of the records, with the nondisclosable information blocked out. Where the individual is not given a copy of the record to retain, no charge shall be made for the cost of copying a record to make it available to an individual who reviews a record in person under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) An individual may request that a record be disclosed to or discussed in the presence of another individual, such as an attorney. The individual may be required to furnish a written statement authorizing the disclosure or discussion in such other individual's presence.</P>
              <P>(c) The Food and Drug Administration will make every reasonable effort to assure that records made available under this section can be understood by the individual, such as by providing an oral or written explanation of the records.</P>

              <P>(a) An individual seeking access to records in a Privacy Act Record System may be required to comply with reasonable requirements to enable the Food and Drug Administration to determine his identity. The identification required shall be suitable considering the nature of the records sought. No identification shall be required to receive access to information that is required to be disclosed to any member of the public under part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations).</P>

              <P>(b) An individual who appears in person for access to records about himself shall be required to provide at least one document to identify himself, e.g., driver's license, passport, or alien or voter registration card to verify his identity. If an individual does not have any such document or requests access to records about himself without appearing in person under circumstances in which his identity cannot be verified from the request itself, he shall be required to certify in writing that he is the individual he claims to be and that he understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a <PRTPAGE P="316"/>record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense subject to a $5,000 fine.</P>
              <P>(c) In making requests under § 21.75, a parent of a minor child or legal guardian of an incompetent individual may be required to verify his relationship to the minor child or the incompetent individual, in addition to verifying his own identity, by providing a copy of the minor's birth certificate, a court order, or other evidence of guardianship.</P>
              <P>(d) Where an individual seeks access to particularly sensitive records, such as medical records, the individual may be required to provide additional information beyond that specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, such as the individual's years of attendance at a particular educational institution, rank attained in the uniformed services, date or place of birth, names of parents, an occupation, or the specific times the individual received medical treatment.</P>

              <P>(a) Where applicable, fees for copying records shall be charged in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section. Fees may only be charged where an individual has requested that a copy be made of a record to which he is granted access. No fee may be charged for making a search of a Privacy Act Record System whether the search is manual, mechanical, or electronic. Where a copy of the record must be made to provide access to the record, e.g., computer printout where no screen reading is available, the copy shall be made available to the individual without cost. Where a medical record is made available to a representative designated by the individual under § 21.33, no fee will be charged.</P>
              <P>(b) The fee schedule is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Copying of records susceptible to photocopying—$.10 per page.</P>
              <P>(2) Copying of records not susceptible to photocopying, e.g., punch cards or magnetic tapes—at actual cost to the determined on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(3) No charge will be made if the total amount of copying for an individual does not exceed $25.</P>
              <P>(c) When a fee is to be assessed, the individual shall be notified prior to the processing of the copies, and be given an opportunity to amend his request. Payment shall be made by check or money order made payable to the “Food and Drug Administration,” and shall be sent to the Accounting Branch (HFA-120), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Advance deposit shall be required where the total amount exceeds $50.</P>

              <P>(a) An individual who received access to a record about himself under subpart D of this part may request that the record be amended if he believes that the record or an item of information is not accurate, relevant to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timely, or complete.</P>
              <P>(b) Amendments under this subpart shall not violate existing statute, regulation, or administrative procedure.</P>
              <P>(1) This subpart does not permit alteration of evidence presented in the course of judicial proceedings or Food and Drug Administration adjudicatory or rule making proceedings or collateral attack upon that which has already been the subject of any such proceedings.</P>
              <P>(2) If the accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, or completeness of the records may be contested in any other pending or imminent agency proceeding, the Food and Drug Administration may refer the individual to the other proceeding as the appropriate means to obtain relief. If the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of a record is, or has been, an issue in another agency proceeding, the request under this section shall be disposed of in accordance with the decision in the other proceeding, absent unusual circumstances.</P>

              <P>(c) Requests to amend records shall be submitted, in writing, to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in accordance with § 21.40(b). Such requests shall include information sufficient to enable <PRTPAGE P="317"/>the Food and Drug Administration to locate the record, a brief description of the items of information requested to be amended, and the reasons why the record should be amended together with any appropriate documentation or arguments in support of the requested amendment. An edited copy of the record showing the described amendment may be included. Verification of identity should be provided in accordance with § 21.44.</P>
              <P>(d) Written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend a record shall be provided within 10 working days to the individual who requested the amendment. Such acknowledgement may request any additional information needed to verify identity or make a determination. No acknowledgement need be made if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the individual notified of the agency's agreement with the request or refusal within the 10-day period.</P>

              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration shall take one of the following actions on a request for amendment of records as promptly as possible:</P>
              <P>(1) Amend any portion of the record which the agency has determined, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, is not accurate, relevant to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timely, or complete, and, in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, inform the individual and previous recipients of the record that has been amended of the amendment.</P>
              <P>(2) Inform the individual of its refusal to amend any portion of the record in the manner requested, the reason for the refusal, and the opportunity for administrative appeal to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Except as provided in § 21.32, such refusal may only be issued by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his or her designate.</P>
              <P>(3) Where another agency was the source of and has control of the record, refer the request to that agency.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency may, for good cause, extend the period for taking action an additional 30 working days if notice is provided to the individual explaining the circumstances of the delay.</P>
              <P>(c) The officials charged with reviewing a record to determine how to respond to a request to amend it, shall assess its accuracy, relevance to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timeliness, or completeness. The determination shall be made in the light of the purpose for which the records or system is used, the agency's need for the record, and the possible adverse consequences to the individual from the record if not amended. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for deletion of a record, or portions of a record, it shall consider anew whether the contested information in the record is relevant and necessary to a Food and Drug Administration purpose.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Food and Drug Administration agrees with an individual's request, it shall take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) So inform the individual in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) In accordance with statute, regulation, or procedure, amend the record to make it accurate, relevant to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timely, or complete, making note of the date and fact of the amendment.</P>

              <P>(c) If the Commissioner on administrative appeal or a court on judicial review determines that the record should be amended in accordance with the individual's request, the Food and Drug Administration shall proceed in accordance with § 21.51(d).</P>
              <P>(d) A final determination on the individual's administrative appeal of the initial refusal to amend the record shall be concluded within 30 working days of the request for such review under paragraph (a) of this section, unless the Commissioner extends such period for good cause and informs the individual in writing of the reasons for the delay and of the approximate date on which a decision of the appeal can be expected.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policies and NEPA planning.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All FDA's policies and programs will be planned, developed, and implemented to achieve the policies declared by NEPA and required by CEQ's regulations to ensure responsible stewardship of the environment for present and future generations.</P>
              <P>(b) Assessment of environmental factors continues throughout planning and is integrated with other program planning at the earliest possible time to ensure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to avoid potential conflicts.</P>

              <P>(c) For actions initiated by the agency, the NEPA process will begin when the agency action under consideration is first identified. For actions initiated by applicants or petitioners, NEPA planning begins when FDA receives from an applicant or petitioner an EA or a claim that a categorical exclusion applies, or when FDA personnel consult with applicants or petitioners on the NEPA-related aspects of their requested actions. FDA may issue a public call for environmental data or otherwise consult with affected individuals or groups when a contemplated action in which it is or may be involved poses potential significant environmental effects.<PRTPAGE P="325"/>

              <SUBJECT>General procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All applications or petitions requesting agency action require the submission of an EA or a claim of categorical exclusion. A claim of categorical exclusion shall include a statement of compliance with the categorical exclusion criteria and shall state that to the applicant's knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist. Failure to submit an adequate EA for an application or petition requesting action by the agency of a type specified in § 25.20, unless the agency can determine that the action qualifies for exclusion under §§ 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35 is sufficient grounds for FDA to refuse to file or approve the application or petition. An EA adequate for filing is one that addresses the relevant environmental issues. An EA adequate for approval is one that contains sufficient information to enable the agency to determine whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.</P>
              <P>(b) The responsible agency officials will evaluate the information contained in the EA to determine whether it is accurate and objective, whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and whether an EIS will be prepared. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are identified, FDA will prepare an EIS for the action in accordance with the procedures in subparts D and E of this part. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are not identified, resulting in a decision not to prepare an EIS, the responsible agency official will prepare a FONSI in accordance with § 25.41.</P>
              <P>(c) Classes of actions that individually or cumulatively do not significantly affect the quality of the human environment ordinarily are excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or an EIS. The classes of actions that qualify as categorical exclusions are set forth in §§ 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35.</P>
              <P>(d) A person submitting an application or petition of a type subject to categorical exclusion under §§ 25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35, or proposing to dispose of an article as provided in § 25.30(d) or 25.32(h), is not required to submit an EA if the person states that the action requested qualifies for a categorical exclusion, citing the particular categorical exclusion that is claimed, and states that to the applicant's knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Environmental assessments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As defined by CEQ in 40 CFR 1508.9, an EA is a concise public document that serves to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for an agency to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI. The EA shall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E) of NEPA, of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted. An EA shall be prepared for each action not categorically excluded in § 25.30, § 25.31, § 25.32, § 25.33, or § 25.34, or § 25.35. The EA shall focus on relevant environmental issues relating to the use and disposal from use of FDA-regulated articles and shall be a concise, objective, and well-balanced document that allows the public to understand the agency's decision. If potentially adverse environmental impacts are identified for an action or a group of related actions, the EA shall discuss any reasonable alternative course of action that offers less environmental risk or that is environmentally preferable to the proposed action. The use of a scientifically justified tiered testing approach, in which testing may be stopped when the results suggest that no significant impact will occur, is an acceptable approach.</P>
              <P>(b) Generally, FDA requires an applicant to prepare an EA and make necessary corrections to it. Ultimately, FDA is responsible for the scope and content of EA's and may include additional information in environmental documents when warranted.</P>
              <P>(c) Information concerning the nature and scope of information that an applicant or petitioner shall submit in an EA may be obtained from the center or other office of the agency having responsibility for the action that is the subject of the environmental evaluation. Applicants and petitioners are encouraged to submit proposed protocols for environmental studies for technical review by agency staff. Applicants and petitioners also are encouraged to consult applicable FDA EA guidance documents, which provide additional advice on how to comply with FDA regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) Consistent with 40 CFR 1500.4(j) and 1502.21, EA's may incorporate by reference information presented in other documents that are available to FDA and to the public.</P>

              <P>(e) The agency evaluates the information contained in an EA and any public input to determine whether it is accurate and objective, whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and whether an EIS or a FONSI will be prepared. The responsible agency official examines the environmental <PRTPAGE P="332"/>risks of the proposed action and the alternative courses of action, selects a course of action, and ensures that any necessary mitigating measures are implemented as a condition for approving the selected course of action.</P>

              <P>(a) As defined by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.13), a FONSI is a document prepared by a Federal agency stating briefly why an action, not otherwise excluded, will not significantly affect the human environment and for which, therefore, an EIS will not be prepared. A FONSI includes the EA or a summary of it and a reference to any other related environmental documents.</P>

              <P>(a) As defined by CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.11) and section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, an EIS should be a clear, concise, and detailed written statement describing:</P>
              <P>(1) The environmental impacts of a proposed action;</P>
              <P>(2) Any adverse effects that cannot be avoided if the action is implemented;</P>

              <P>(4) The relationship between local short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and</P>

              <P>(c) Under the conditions prescribed in 40 CFR 1502.9, the agency will prepare a supplement for a draft or final EIS and introduce the supplement into the administrative record.</P>

              <P>(a) To the extent actions are not protected from disclosure by existing law applicable to the agency's operation, FDA will involve the public in preparing and implementing its NEPA procedures and will provide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, and the availability of environmental documents.</P>
              <P>(b) Many FDA actions involving investigations, review, and approval or market authorization of applications, and premarket notifications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, and tobacco products are protected from disclosure under the Trade Secret Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, and section 301(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These actions are also protected from disclosure under FDA's regulations including part 20, §§ 312.130(a), 314.430(b), 514.11(b), 514.12(a), 601.50(a), 601.51(a), 807.95(b), 812.38(a), and 814.9(b) of this chapter. Even the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, and tobacco products is protected from disclosure under these regulations. Therefore, unless the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, tobacco products, or premarket notification for devices has been made publicly available, the release of the environmental document before approval or authorization of human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices and tobacco products is inconsistent with statutory requirements imposed on FDA. Appropriate environmental documents, comments, and responses will be included in the administrative record to the extent allowed by applicable laws.</P>

When such data and information are pertinent to the environmental review of a proposed action, an applicant or petitioner shall submit such data and information separately in a confidential section and shall summarize the confidential data and information in the EA to the extent possible.</P>
              <P>(b) FONSI's and EA's will be available to the public in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6 as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) When the proposed action is the subject of a notice of proposed rulemaking or a notice of filing published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the notice shall state that no EIS is necessary and that the FONSI and the EA are available for public inspection at FDA's Division of Dockets Management. If the responsible agency official is unable to complete environmental consideration of the proposed action before a notice of filing of a food or color additive petition is required to be published under the act, and if the subsequent environmental analysis leads to the conclusion that no EIS is necessary, the final regulation rather than the notice of filing shall state that no EIS is necessary and that the FONSI and the EA are available upon request and filed in FDA's Division of Dockets Management.</P>

              <P>(2) For actions for which notice is not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the FONSI and the EA shall be made available to the public upon request according to the procedures in 40 CFR 1506.6.</P>
              <P>(3) For a limited number of actions, the agency may make the FONSI and EA available for public review (including review by State and areawide information clearinghouses) for 30 days before the agency makes its final determination whether to prepare an EIS and before the action may begin, as described in 40 CFR 1501.4(e). This procedure will be followed when the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one that normally requires an EIS or when the proposed action is one without precedent.</P>

The EIS will in all other respects conform to the requirements for EIS's as specified in 40 CFR part 1502 and 1506.6(f).</P>
              <P>(b) Comments on the EIS may be submitted after the approval or market authorization of the drug, animal drug, biologic product, device, or tobacco product.

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part substantially reflects relevant provisions of the framework agreement and its sectoral annexes on pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (GMP's) and medical devices of the “Agreement on Mutual Recognition Between the United States of America and the European Community” (the MRA), signed at London May 18, 1998. For codification purposes, certain provisions of the MRA have been modified for use in this part. This modification is done for purposes of clarity only and shall not affect the text of the MRA concluded between the United States and the European Community (EC), or the rights and obligations of the United States or the EC under that agreement. Whereas the parties to the MRA are the United States and EC, this part is relevant only to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) implementation of the MRA, including the sectoral annexes reflected in subparts A and B of this part. This part does not govern implementation of the MRA by the EC, which will implement the MRA in accordance with its internal procedures, nor does this part address implementation of the MRA by other concerned U.S. Federal agencies. For purposes of this part, the terms “party” or “parties,” where relevant to FDA's implementation of the MRA, should be considered as referring to FDA only. If the parties to the MRA subsequently amend or terminate the MRA, FDA will modify this part accordingly, using appropriate administrative procedures.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Enforcement</E> means action taken by an authority to protect the public from products of suspect quality, safety, and effectiveness or to assure that products are manufactured in compliance with appropriate laws, regulations, standards, and commitments made as part of the approval to market a product.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Equivalence</E> of the regulatory systems means that the systems are sufficiently comparable to assure that the process of inspection and the ensuing inspection reports will provide adequate information to determine whether respective statutory and regulatory requirements of the authorities have been fulfilled. Equivalence does not require that the respective regulatory systems have identical procedures.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Good Manufacturing Practices</E> (GMP's). [The United States has clarified its interpretation that under the MRA, paragraph (c)(1) of this section has to be understood as the U.S. definition and paragraph (c)(2) as the EC definition.]</P>
              <P>(1) GMP's mean the requirements found in the legislations, regulations, and administrative provisions for methods to be used in, and the facilities or controls to be used for, the manufacturing, processing, packing, and/or holding of a drug to assure that such drug meets the requirements as to safety, and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports or is represented to possess.</P>

              <P>(2) GMP's are that part of quality assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled to quality standards. For the purpose of this subpart, GMP's include, therefore, the system whereby the manufacturer receives the specifications of the product and/or process from the marketing authorization/product authorization or license holder or applicant and ensures the product is made in compliance with its specifications (qualified person certification in the EC).<PRTPAGE P="337"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inspection</E> means an onsite evaluation of a manufacturing facility to determine whether such manufacturing facility is operating in compliance with GMP's and/or commitments made as part of the approval to market a product.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Inspection report</E> means the written observations and GMP's compliance assessment completed by an authority listed in appendix B of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Regulatory system</E> means the body of legal requirements for GMP's, inspections, and enforcements that ensure public health protection and legal authority to assure adherence to these requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to pharmaceutical inspections carried out in the United States and Member States of the European Community (EC) before products are marketed (hereafter referred to as “preapproval inspections”) as well as during their marketing (hereafter referred to as “postapproval inspections”).</P>
              <P>(b) Appendix A of this subpart names the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions governing these inspections and the good manufacturing practices (GMP's) requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) Appendix B of this subpart lists the authorities participating in activities under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Sections 26.65, 26.66, 26.67, 26.68, 26.69, and 26.70 of subpart C of this part do not apply to this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) The authorities of the parties will establish and communicate to each other their draft programs for assessing the equivalence of the respective regulatory systems in terms of quality assurance of the products and consumer protection. These programs will be carried out, as deemed necessary by the regulatory authorities, for post- and preapproval inspections and for various product classes or processes.<PRTPAGE P="338"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) The equivalence assessment shall include information exchanges (including inspection reports), joint training, and joint inspections for the purpose of assessing regulatory systems and the authorities' capabilities. In conducting the equivalence assessment, the parties will ensure that efforts are made to save resources.</P>
              <P>(d) Equivalence assessment for authorities added to appendix B of this subpart after the effective date described in § 26.80(a) will be conducted as described in this subpart, as soon as practicable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Equivalence determination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Equivalence is established by having in place regulatory systems covering the criteria referred to in appendix D of this subpart, and a demonstrated pattern of consistent performance in accordance with these criteria. A list of authorities determined as equivalent shall be agreed to by the Joint Sectoral Committee at the end of the transition period, with reference to any limitation in terms of inspection type (e.g., postapproval or preapproval) or product classes or processes.</P>
              <P>(b) The parties will document insufficient evidence of equivalence, lack of opportunity to assess equivalence or a determination of nonequivalence, in sufficient detail to allow the authority being assessed to know how to attain equivalence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Start of operational period.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The operational period shall start at the end of the transition period and its provisions apply to inspection reports generated by authorities listed as equivalent for the inspections performed in their territory.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition, when an authority is not listed as equivalent based on adequate experience gained during the transition period, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will accept for normal endorsement (as provided in § 26.12) inspection reports generated as a result of inspections conducted jointly by that authority on its territory and another authority listed as equivalent, provided that the authority of the Member State in which the inspection is performed can guarantee enforcement of the findings of the inspection report and require that corrective measures be taken when necessary. FDA has the option to participate in these inspections, and based on experience gained during the transition period, the parties will agree on procedures for exercising this option.</P>
              <P>(c) In the European Community (EC), the qualified person will be relieved of responsibility for carrying the controls laid down in Article 22 paragraph 1(b) of Council Directive 75/319/EEC (see appendix A of this subpart) provided that these controls have been carried out in the United States and that each batch/lot is accompanied by a batch certificate (in accordance with the World Health Organization Certification Scheme on the Quality of Medicinal Products) issued by the manufacturer certifying that the product complies with requirements of the marketing authorization and signed by the person responsible for releasing the batch/lot.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nature of recognition of inspection reports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Inspection reports (containing information as established under § 26.8), including a good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance assessment, prepared by authorities listed as equivalent, will be provided to the authority of the importing party. Based on the determination of equivalence in light of the experience gained, these inspection reports will normally be endorsed by the authority of the importing party, except under specific and delineated circumstances. Examples of such circumstances include indications of material inconsistencies or inadequacies in an inspection report, quality defects identified in the postmarket surveillance or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product quality or consumer safety. In such cases, the authority of the importing party may request clarification from the authority of the exporting party which may lead to a request for reinspection. The authorities will endeavor to respond to requests for clarification in a timely manner.</P>
              <P>(b) Where divergence is not clarified in this process, an authority of the importing country may carry out an inspection of the production facility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose of this part.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This part specifies the conditions by which each party will accept or recognize results of conformity assessment <PRTPAGE P="360"/>procedures, produced by the other party's conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) or authorities, in assessing conformity to the importing party's requirements, as specified on a sector-specific basis in subparts A and B of this part, and to provide for other related cooperative activities. The objective of such mutual recognition is to provide effective market access throughout the territories of the parties with regard to conformity assessment for all products covered under this part. If any obstacles to such access arise, consultations will promptly be held. In the absence of a satisfactory outcome of such consultations, the party alleging its market access has been denied may, within 90 days of such consultation, invoke its right to terminate the “Agreement on Mutual Recognition Between the United States of America and the European Community,” from which this part is derived, in accordance with § 26.80.</P>

              <P>(c) Where sectoral transition arrangements have been specified in subparts A and B of this part, the obligations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will apply following the successful completion of those sectoral transition arrangements, with the understanding that the conformity assessment procedures utilized assure conformity to the satisfaction of the receiving party, with applicable legislative, regulatory, and administrative provisions of that party, equivalent to the assurance offered by the receiving party's own procedures.</P>

              <P>(d) In the event that the other party contests on the basis of documented evidence the technical competence or compliance of a proposed CAB, or indicates in writing that it requires an additional 30 days to more fully verify such evidence, such CAB shall not be included on the list of CAB's in subpart B of this part. In this instance, the Joint Committee may decide that the body concerned be verified. After the completion of such verification, the proposal to list the CAB in subpart B may be resubmitted to the other party.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension of listed conformity assessment bodies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following procedures shall apply with regard to the suspension of a conformity assessment body (CAB) listed in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(a) A party shall notify the other party of its contestation of the technical competence or compliance of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part and the contesting party's intent to suspend such CAB. Such contestation shall be exercised when justified in an objective and reasoned manner in writing to the other party;</P>
              <P>(b) The CAB shall be given prompt notice by the other party and an opportunity to present information in order to refute the contestation or to correct the deficiencies which form the basis of the contestation;</P>
              <P>(c) Any such contestation shall be discussed between the parties in the Joint Sectoral Committee described in subpart B of this part. If there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, the contesting party shall refer the matter directly to the Joint Committee. If agreement to suspend is reached by the Joint Sectoral Committee or, if there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, by the Joint Committee, the CAB shall be suspended;</P>
              <P>(d) Where the Joint Sectoral Committee or Joint Committee decides that verification of technical competence or compliance is required, it shall normally be carried out in a timely manner by the party in whose territory the body in question is located, but may be carried out jointly by the parties in justified cases;</P>
              <P>(e) If the matter has not been resolved by the Joint Sectoral Committee within 10 days of the notice of contestation, the matter shall be referred to the Joint Committee for a decision. If there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, the matter shall be referred directly to the Joint Committee. If no decision is reached by the Joint Committee within 10 days of the referral to it, the CAB shall be suspended upon the request of the contesting party;</P>

              <P>(f) Upon the suspension of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part, a party is <PRTPAGE P="362"/>no longer obligated to accept or recognize the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by that CAB subsequent to suspension. A party shall continue to accept the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by that CAB prior to suspension, unless a regulatory authority of the party decides otherwise based on health, safety or environmental considerations or failure to satisfy other requirements within the scope of subpart B of this part; and</P>
              <P>(g) The suspension shall remain in effect until agreement has been reached by the parties upon the future status of that body.</P>

              <P>(a) A party proposing to withdraw a CAB listed in subpart B of this part shall forward its proposal in writing to the other party;</P>
              <P>(b) Such CAB shall be promptly notified by the other party and shall be provided a period of at least 30 days from receipt to provide information in order to refute or to correct the deficiencies which form the basis of the proposed withdrawal;</P>
              <P>(c) Within 60 days following receipt of the proposal, the other party shall indicate its position regarding either its confirmation or its opposition. Upon confirmation, the withdrawal from the list in subpart B of this part of the CAB shall take effect;</P>
              <P>(d) In the event the other party opposes the proposal to withdraw by supporting the technical competence and compliance of the CAB, the CAB shall not at that time be withdrawn from the list of CAB's in subpart B of this part. In this instance, the Joint Sectoral Committee or the Joint Committee may decide to carry out a joint verification of the body concerned. After the completion of such verification, the proposal for withdrawal of the CAB may be resubmitted to the other party; and</P>
              <P>(e) Subsequent to the withdrawal of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part, a party shall continue to accept the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by that CAB prior to withdrawal, unless a regulatory authority of the party decides otherwise based on health, safety, and environmental considerations or failure to satisfy other requirements within the scope of subpart B of this part.</P>

              <P>Except as provided in §§ 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize <PRTPAGE P="369"/>the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative. No informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exception from general requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The obtaining of informed consent shall be deemed feasible unless, before use of the test article (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section), both the investigator and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation certify in writing all of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the test article.</P>
              <P>(2) Informed consent cannot be obtained from the subject because of an inability to communicate with, or obtain legally effective consent from, the subject.</P>
              <P>(3) Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legal representative.</P>
              <P>(4) There is available no alternative method of approved or generally recognized therapy that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the life of the subject.</P>
              <P>(b) If immediate use of the test article is, in the investigator's opinion, required to preserve the life of the subject, and time is not sufficient to obtain the independent determination required in paragraph (a) of this section in advance of using the test article, the determinations of the clinical investigator shall be made and, within 5 working days after the use of the article, be reviewed and evaluated in writing by a physician who is not participating in the clinical investigation.</P>
              <P>(c) The documentation required in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be submitted to the IRB within 5 working days after the use of the test article.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Under 10 U.S.C. 1107(f) the President may waive the prior consent requirement for the administration of an investigational new drug to a member of the armed forces in connection with the member's participation in a particular military operation. The statute specifies that only the President may waive informed consent in this connection and the President may grant such a waiver only if the President determines in writing that obtaining consent: Is not feasible; is contrary to the best interests of the military member; or is not in the interests of national security. The statute further provides that in making a determination to waive prior informed consent on the ground that it is not feasible or the ground that it is contrary to the best interests of the military members involved, the President shall apply the standards and criteria that are set forth in the relevant FDA regulations for a waiver of the prior informed consent requirements of section 505(i)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)(4)). Before such a determination may be made that obtaining informed consent from military personnel prior to the use of an investigational drug (including an antibiotic or biological product) in a specific protocol under an investigational new drug application (IND) sponsored by the Department of Defense (DOD) and limited to specific military personnel involved in a particular military operation is not feasible or is contrary to the best interests of the military members involved the Secretary of Defense must first request such a determination from the President, and certify and document to the President that the following standards and criteria contained in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section have been met.</P>

              <P>(i) The extent and strength of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug in relation to the medical risk that could be encountered during the military operation supports the drug's administration under an IND.<PRTPAGE P="370"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The military operation presents a substantial risk that military personnel may be subject to a chemical, biological, nuclear, or other exposure likely to produce death or serious or life-threatening injury or illness.</P>
              <P>(iii) There is no available satisfactory alternative therapeutic or preventive treatment in relation to the intended use of the investigational new drug.</P>
              <P>(iv) Conditioning use of the investigational new drug on the voluntary participation of each member could significantly risk the safety and health of any individual member who would decline its use, the safety of other military personnel, and the accomplishment of the military mission.</P>
              <P>(v) A duly constituted institutional review board (IRB) established and operated in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, responsible for review of the study, has reviewed and approved the investigational new drug protocol and the administration of the investigational new drug without informed consent. DOD's request is to include the documentation required by § 56.115(a)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(vi) DOD has explained:</P>
              <P>(A) The context in which the investigational drug will be administered, e.g., the setting or whether it will be self-administered or it will be administered by a health professional;</P>
              <P>(B) The nature of the disease or condition for which the preventive or therapeutic treatment is intended; and</P>
              <P>(C) To the extent there are existing data or information available, information on conditions that could alter the effects of the investigational drug.</P>
              <P>(vii) DOD's recordkeeping system is capable of tracking and will be used to track the proposed treatment from supplier to the individual recipient.</P>
              <P>(viii) Each member involved in the military operation will be given, prior to the administration of the investigational new drug, a specific written information sheet (including information required by 10 U.S.C. 1107(d)) concerning the investigational new drug, the risks and benefits of its use, potential side effects, and other pertinent information about the appropriate use of the product.</P>
              <P>(ix) Medical records of members involved in the military operation will accurately document the receipt by members of the notification required by paragraph (d)(1)(viii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(x) Medical records of members involved in the military operation will accurately document the receipt by members of any investigational new drugs in accordance with FDA regulations including part 312 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(xi) DOD will provide adequate followup to assess whether there are beneficial or adverse health consequences that result from the use of the investigational product.</P>
              <P>(xii) DOD is pursuing drug development, including a time line, and marketing approval with due diligence.</P>
              <P>(xiii) FDA has concluded that the investigational new drug protocol may proceed subject to a decision by the President on the informed consent waiver request.</P>
              <P>(xiv) DOD will provide training to the appropriate medical personnel and potential recipients on the specific investigational new drug to be administered prior to its use.</P>
              <P>(xv) DOD has stated and justified the time period for which the waiver is needed, not to exceed one year, unless separately renewed under these standards and criteria.</P>
              <P>(xvi) DOD shall have a continuing obligation to report to the FDA and to the President any changed circumstances relating to these standards and criteria (including the time period referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(xv) of this section) or that otherwise might affect the determination to use an investigational new drug without informed consent.</P>

              <P>(xvii) DOD is to provide public notice as soon as practicable and consistent with classification requirements through notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> describing each waiver of informed consent determination, a summary of the most updated scientific information on the products used, and other pertinent information.</P>
              <P>(xviii) Use of the investigational drug without informed consent otherwise conforms with applicable law.</P>

              <P>(2) The duly constituted institutional review board, described in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, must include at <PRTPAGE P="371"/>least 3 nonaffiliated members who shall not be employees or officers of the Federal Government (other than for purposes of membership on the IRB) and shall be required to obtain any necessary security clearances. This IRB shall review the proposed IND protocol at a convened meeting at which a majority of the members are present including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas and, if feasible, including a majority of the nonaffiliated members. The information required by § 56.115(a)(2) of this chapter is to be provided to the Secretary of Defense for further review.</P>
              <P>(3) The duly constituted institutional review board, described in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, must review and approve:</P>
              <P>(i) The required information sheet;</P>
              <P>(ii) The adequacy of the plan to disseminate information, including distribution of the information sheet to potential recipients, on the investigational product (e.g., in forms other than written);</P>
              <P>(iii) The adequacy of the information and plans for its dissemination to health care providers, including potential side effects, contraindications, potential interactions, and other pertinent considerations; and</P>
              <P>(iv) An informed consent form as required by part 50 of this chapter, in those circumstances in which DOD determines that informed consent may be obtained from some or all personnel involved.</P>
              <P>(4) DOD is to submit to FDA summaries of institutional review board meetings at which the proposed protocol has been reviewed.</P>
              <P>(5) Nothing in these criteria or standards is intended to preempt or limit FDA's and DOD's authority or obligations under applicable statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Obtaining informed consent for investigational in vitro diagnostic devices used to identify chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents will be deemed feasible unless, before use of the test article, both the investigator (e.g., clinical laboratory director or other responsible individual) and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation make the determinations and later certify in writing all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the investigational in vitro diagnostic device to identify a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent that would suggest a terrorism event or other public health emergency.</P>
              <P>(ii) Informed consent cannot be obtained from the subject because:</P>
              <P>(A) There was no reasonable way for the person directing that the specimen be collected to know, at the time the specimen was collected, that there would be a need to use the investigational in vitro diagnostic device on that subject's specimen; and</P>
              <P>(B) Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject without risking the life of the subject.</P>
              <P>(iii) Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>
              <P>(iv) There is no cleared or approved available alternative method of diagnosis, to identify the chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the life of the subject.</P>
              <P>(2) If use of the investigational device is, in the opinion of the investigator (e.g., clinical laboratory director or other responsible person), required to preserve the life of the subject, and time is not sufficient to obtain the independent determination required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section in advance of using the investigational device, the determinations of the investigator shall be made and, within 5 working days after the use of the device, be reviewed and evaluated in writing by a physician who is not participating in the clinical investigation.</P>
              <P>(3) The investigator must submit the written certification of the determinations made by the investigator and an independent physician required in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section to the IRB and FDA within 5 working days after the use of the device.</P>

              <P>(4) An investigator must disclose the investigational status of the in vitro diagnostic device and what is known about the performance characteristics of the device in the report to the subject's health care provider and in any <PRTPAGE P="372"/>report to public health authorities. The investigator must provide the IRB with the information required in § 50.25 (except for the information described in § 50.25(a)(8)) and the procedures that will be used to provide this information to each subject or the subject's legally authorized representative at the time the test results are provided to the subject's health care provider and public health authorities.</P>
              <P>(5) The IRB is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the information required in section 50.25 (except for the information described in § 50.25(a)(8)) and for ensuring that procedures are in place to provide this information to each subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>
              <P>(6) No State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation or other requirement that informed consent be obtained before an investigational in vitro diagnostic device may be used to identify chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent in suspected terrorism events and other potential public health emergencies that is different from, or in addition to, the requirements of this regulation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all research subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of or consultant to the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation) finds and documents each of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.</P>
              <P>(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because:</P>
              <P>(i) The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;</P>
              <P>(ii) The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and</P>
              <P>(iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.</P>
              <P>(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because:</P>
              <P>(i) Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;</P>
              <P>(ii) Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.</P>
              <P>(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.</P>
              <P>(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact legally authorized representatives and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.</P>

              <P>(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document <PRTPAGE P="373"/>consistent with § 50.25. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, including, at least:</P>
              <P>(i) Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by the IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn;</P>
              <P>(ii) Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits;</P>
              <P>(iii) Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population, and its results;</P>
              <P>(iv) Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation; and</P>
              <P>(v) If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact within the therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact family members and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.</P>
              <P>(b) The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the investigation and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall also ensure that there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a legally authorized representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the subject's condition improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally authorized representative or family member can be contacted, information about the clinical investigation is to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or family member, if feasible.</P>
              <P>(c) The IRB determinations required by paragraph (a) of this section and the documentation required by paragraph (e) of this section are to be retained by the IRB for at least 3 years after completion of the clinical investigation, and the records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by FDA in accordance with § 56.115(b) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(d) Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under §§ 312.30 or 812.35 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="374"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under paragraph (a) of this section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this information to FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to other IRB's that have been, or are, asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation by that sponsor.</P>

              <P>(a) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart D, the IRB must determine that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing assent.</P>

              <P>(b) In determining whether children are capable of providing assent, the <PRTPAGE P="377"/>IRB must take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to be involved in clinical investigations under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) The assent of the children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with the clinical investigation if the IRB determines:</P>
              <P>(1) That the capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted, or</P>
              <P>(2) That the intervention or procedure involved in the clinical investigation holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the clinical investigation.</P>
              <P>(d) Even where the IRB determines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still waive the assent requirement if it finds and documents that:</P>
              <P>(1) The clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;</P>
              <P>(2) The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;</P>
              <P>(3) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver; and</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.</P>
              <P>(e) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of this subpart D, the IRB must determine, in accordance with and to the extent that consent is required under part 50, that the permission of each child's parents or guardian is granted.</P>
              <P>(1) Where parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations to be conducted under § 50.51 or § 50.52.</P>
              <P>(2) Where clinical investigations are covered by § 50.53 or § 50.54 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.</P>
              <P>(f) Permission by parents or guardians must be documented in accordance with and to the extent required by § 50.27.</P>
              <P>(g) When the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also determine whether and how assent must be documented.</P>

              <P>(a) Children who are wards of the State or any other agency, institution, or entity can be included in clinical investigations approved under § 50.53 or § 50.54 only if such clinical investigations are:</P>
              <P>(1) Related to their status as wards; or</P>
              <P>(2) Conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards.</P>
              <P>(b) If the clinical investigation is approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the IRB must require appointment of an advocate for each child who is a ward.</P>
              <P>(1) The advocate will serve in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parentis.</P>
              <P>(2) One individual may serve as advocate for more than one child.</P>
              <P>(3) The advocate must be an individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interest of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the clinical investigation.</P>
              <P>(4) The advocate must not be associated in any way (except in the role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the clinical investigation, the investigator(s), or the guardian organization.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates clinical studies submitted in marketing applications, required by law, for new human drugs and biological products and marketing applications and reclassification petitions for medical devices.</P>
            <P>(b) The agency reviews data generated in these clinical studies to determine whether the applications are approvable under the statutory requirements. FDA may consider clinical studies inadequate and the data inadequate if, among other things, appropriate steps have not been taken in the design, conduct, reporting, and analysis of the studies to minimize bias. One potential source of bias in clinical studies is a financial interest of the clinical investigator in the outcome of the study because of the way payment is arranged (e.g., a royalty) or because the investigator has a proprietary interest in the product (e.g., a patent) or because the investigator has an equity interest in the sponsor of the covered study. This section and conforming regulations require an applicant whose submission relies in part on clinical data to disclose certain financial arrangements between sponsor(s) of the covered studies and the clinical investigators and certain interests of the clinical investigators in the product under study or in the sponsor of the covered studies. FDA will use this information, in conjunction with information about the design and purpose of the study, as well as information obtained through on-site inspections, in the agency's assessment of the reliability of the data.</P>

            <P>For the purposes of this part:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Compensation affected by the outcome of clinical studies</E> means compensation that could be higher for a favorable outcome than for an unfavorable outcome, such as compensation that is explicitly greater for a favorable result or compensation to the investigator in the form of an equity interest in the sponsor of a covered study or in the form of compensation tied to sales of the product, such as a royalty interest.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Significant equity interest in the sponsor of a covered study</E> means any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices (generally, interests in a nonpublicly traded corporation), or any equity interest in a publicly traded corporation that exceeds $50,000 during the time the clinical investigator is carrying out the study and for 1 year following completion of the study.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Proprietary interest in the tested product</E> means property or other financial interest in the product including, but not limited to, a patent, trademark, copyright or licensing agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Clinical investigator</E> means only a listed or identified investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects. The term also includes the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Covered clinical study</E> means any study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or any study in which a single investigator makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety. This would, in general, not include phase l tolerance studies or pharmacokinetic studies, most clinical pharmacology studies (unless they are critical to an efficacy determination), large open safety studies conducted at multiple sites, treatment protocols, and parallel track protocols. An applicant may consult with FDA as to which clinical studies constitute “covered clinical studies” for purposes of complying with financial disclosure requirements.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Significant payments of other sorts</E> means payments made by the sponsor of a covered study to the investigator <PRTPAGE P="379"/>or the institution to support activities of the investigator that have a monetary value of more than $25,000, exclusive of the costs of conducting the clinical study or other clinical studies, (e.g., a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment or retainers for ongoing consultation or honoraria) during the time the clinical investigator is carrying out the study and for 1 year following the completion of the study.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Applicant</E> means the party who submits a marketing application to FDA for approval of a drug, device, or biologic product. The applicant is responsible for submitting the appropriate certification and disclosure statements required in this part.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Sponsor of the covered clinical study</E> means the party supporting a particular study at the time it was carried out.</P>

            <P>For purposes of this part, an applicant must submit a list of all clinical investigators who conducted covered clinical studies to determine whether the applicant's product meets FDA's marketing requirements, identifying those clinical investigators who are full-time or part-time employees of the sponsor of each covered study. The applicant must also completely and accurately disclose or certify information concerning the financial interests of a clinical investigator who is not a full-time or part-time employee of the sponsor for each covered clinical study. Clinical investigators subject to investigational new drug or investigational device exemption regulations must provide the sponsor of the study with sufficient accurate information needed to allow subsequent disclosure or certification. The applicant is required to submit for each clinical investigator who participates in a covered study, either a certification that none of the financial arrangements described in § 54.2 exist, or disclose the nature of those arrangements to the agency. Where the applicant acts with due diligence to obtain the information required in this section but is unable to do so, the applicant shall certify that despite the applicant's due diligence in attempting to obtain the information, the applicant was unable to obtain the information and shall include the reason.</P>
            <P>(a) The applicant (of an application submitted under sections 505, 506, 510(k), 513, or 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) that relies in whole or in part on clinical studies shall submit, for each clinical investigator who participated in a covered clinical study, either a certification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a disclosure statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) Certification: The applicant covered by this section shall submit for all clinical investigators (as defined in § 54.2(d)), to whom the certification applies, a completed Form FDA 3454 attesting to the absence of financial interests and arrangements described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The form shall be dated and signed by the chief financial officer or other responsible corporate official or representative.</P>
            <P>(2) If the certification covers less than all covered clinical data in the application, the applicant shall include in the certification a list of the studies covered by this certification.</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure Statement: For any clinical investigator defined in § 54.2(d) for whom the applicant does not submit the certification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the applicant shall submit a completed Form FDA 3455 disclosing completely and accurately the following:</P>

            <P>(i) Any financial arrangement entered into between the sponsor of the <PRTPAGE P="380"/>covered study and the clinical investigator involved in the conduct of a covered clinical trial, whereby the value of the compensation to the clinical investigator for conducting the study could be influenced by the outcome of the study;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any significant payments of other sorts from the sponsor of the covered study, such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for ongoing consultation, or honoraria;</P>
            <P>(iii) Any proprietary interest in the tested product held by any clinical investigator involved in a study;</P>
            <P>(iv) Any significant equity interest in the sponsor of the covered study held by any clinical investigator involved in any clinical study; and</P>
            <P>(v) Any steps taken to minimize the potential for bias resulting from any of the disclosed arrangements, interests, or payments.</P>
            <P>(b) The clinical investigator shall provide to the sponsor of the covered study sufficient accurate financial information to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements as required in paragraph (a) of this section. The investigator shall promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur in the course of the investigation or for 1 year following completion of the study.</P>
            <P>(c) Refusal to file application. FDA may refuse to file any marketing application described in paragraph (a) of this section that does not contain the information required by this section or a certification by the applicant that the applicant has acted with due diligence to obtain the information but was unable to do so and stating the reason.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Evaluation of disclosure statement.</E> FDA will evaluate the information disclosed under § 54.4(a)(2) about each covered clinical study in an application to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests on the reliability of the study. FDA may consider both the size and nature of a disclosed financial interest (including the potential increase in the value of the interest if the product is approved) and steps that have been taken to minimize the potential for bias.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of study design.</E> In assessing the potential of an investigator's financial interests to bias a study, FDA will take into account the design and purpose of the study. Study designs that utilize such approaches as multiple investigators (most of whom do not have a disclosable interest), blinding, objective endpoints, or measurement of endpoints by someone other than the investigator may adequately protect against any bias created by a disclosable financial interest.</P>

            <P>(1) Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in question;</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Clinical investigation</E> means any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects, and that either must meet the requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration under section <PRTPAGE P="383"/>505(i) or 520(g) of the act, or need not meet the requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration under these sections of the act, but the results of which are intended to be later submitted to, or held for inspection by, the Food and Drug Administration as part of an application for a research or marketing permit. The term does not include experiments that must meet the provisions of part 58, regarding nonclinical laboratory studies. The terms <E T="03">research, clinical research, clinical study, study,</E> and <E T="03">clinical investigation</E> are deemed to be synonymous for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Emergency use</E> means the use of a test article on a human subject in a life-threatening situation in which no standard acceptable treatment is available, and in which there is not sufficient time to obtain IRB approval.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Human subject</E> means an individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as a recipient of the test article or as a control. A subject may be either a healthy individual or a patient.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Institution</E> means any public or private entity or agency (including Federal, State, and other agencies). The term <E T="03">facility</E> as used in section 520(g) of the act is deemed to be synonymous with the term <E T="03">institution</E> for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Institutional Review Board (IRB)</E> means any board, committee, or other group formally designated by an institution to review, to approve the initiation of, and to conduct periodic review of, biomedical research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of such review is to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. The term has the same meaning as the phrase <E T="03">institutional review committee</E> as used in section 520(g) of the act.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Investigator</E> means an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subject) or, in the event of an investigation conducted by a team of individuals, is the responsible leader of that team.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Minimal risk</E> means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Sponsor</E> means a person or other entity that initiates a clinical investigation, but that does not actually conduct the investigation, i.e., the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subject under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual (e.g., a corporation or agency) that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is considered to be a sponsor (not a sponsor-investigator), and the employees are considered to be investigators.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Sponsor-investigator</E> means an individual who both initiates and actually conducts, alone or with others, a clinical investigation, i.e., under whose immediate direction the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subject. The term does not include any person other than an individual, e.g., it does not include a corporation or agency. The obligations of a sponsor-investigator under this part include both those of a sponsor and those of an investigator.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Test article</E> means any drug for human use, biological product for human use, medical device for human use, human food additive, color additive, electronic product, or any other article subject to regulation under the act or under sections 351 or 354-360F of the Public Health Service Act.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">IRB approval</E> means the determination of the IRB that the clinical investigation has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and Federal requirements.</P>

              <P>(b) Except as provided in §§ 56.104 and 56.105, the Food and Drug Administration may decide not to consider in support of an application for a research or marketing permit any data or information that has been derived from a clinical investigation that has not been approved by, and that was not subject to initial and continuing review by, an IRB meeting the requirements of this part. The determination that a clinical investigation may not be considered in support of an application for a research or marketing permit does not, however, relieve the applicant for such a permit of any obligation under any other applicable regulations to submit the results of the investigation to the Food and Drug Administration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Registration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Who must register?</E> Each IRB in the United States that reviews clinical investigations regulated by FDA under sections 505(i) or 520(g) of the act and each IRB in the United States that reviews clinical investigations that are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits for FDA-regulated products must register at a site maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (A research permit under section 505(i) of the act is usually known as an investigational new drug application (IND), while a research permit under section 520(g) of the act is usually known as an investigational device exemption (IDE).) An individual authorized to act on the IRB's behalf must submit the registration information. All other IRBs may register voluntarily.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What information must an IRB register?</E> Each IRB must provide the following information:</P>

              <P>(1) The name, mailing address, and street address (if different from the <PRTPAGE P="385"/>mailing address) of the institution operating the IRB and the name, mailing address, phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the senior officer of that institution who is responsible for overseeing activities performed by the IRB;</P>
              <P>(2) The IRB's name, mailing address, street address (if different from the mailing address), phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address; each IRB chairperson's name, phone number, and electronic mail address; and the name, mailing address, phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the contact person providing the registration information.</P>
              <P>(3) The approximate number of active protocols involving FDA-regulated products reviewed. For purposes of this rule, an “active protocol” is any protocol for which an IRB conducted an initial review or a continuing review at a convened meeting or under an expedited review procedure during the preceding 12 months; and</P>
              <P>(4) A description of the types of FDA-regulated products (such as biological products, color additives, food additives, human drugs, or medical devices) involved in the protocols that the IRB reviews.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When must an IRB register?</E> Each IRB must submit an initial registration. The initial registration must occur before the IRB begins to review a clinical investigation described in paragraph (a) of this section. Each IRB must renew its registration every 3 years. IRB registration becomes effective after review and acceptance by HHS.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Where can an IRB register?</E> Each IRB may register electronically through <E T="03">http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile.</E> If an IRB lacks the ability to register electronically, it must send its registration information, in writing, to the Office of Good Clinical Practice, Office of Special Medical Programs, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 32, Rm. 5129, Silver Spring, MD 20993.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">How does an IRB revise its registration information?</E> If an IRB's contact or chair person information changes, the IRB must revise its registration information by submitting any changes in that information within 90 days of the change. An IRB's decision to review new types of FDA-regulated products (such as a decision to review studies pertaining to food additives whereas the IRB previously reviewed studies pertaining to drug products), or to discontinue reviewing clinical investigations regulated by FDA is a change that must be reported within 30 days of the change. An IRB's decision to disband is a change that must be reported within 30 days of permanent cessation of the IRB's review of research. All other information changes may be reported when the IRB renews its registration. The revised information must be sent to FDA either electronically or in writing in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds, and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to possessing the professional competence necessary to review the specific research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. * * * The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with those subjects.</P>

              <P>(b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no IRB <PRTPAGE P="386"/>consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the instituton's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No IRB may consist entirely of members of one profession.</P>
              <P>(c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in the scientific area and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.</P>
              <P>(d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.</P>
              <P>(e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.</P>
              <P>(f) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of complex issues which require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.</P>

              <P>(d) In cases where the documentation requirement is waived under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the research.</P>
              <P>(e) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing. For investigations involving an exception to informed consent under § 50.24 of this chapter, an IRB shall promptly notify in writing the investigator and the sponsor of the research when an IRB determines that it cannot approve the research because it does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under § 50.24(a) of this chapter or because of other relevant ethical concerns. The written notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's determination.</P>
              <P>(f) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by these regulations at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research.</P>
              <P>(g) An IRB shall provide in writing to the sponsor of research involving an exception to informed consent under § 50.24 of this chapter a copy of information that has been publicly disclosed under § 50.24(a)(7)(ii) and (a)(7)(iii) of this chapter. The IRB shall provide this information to the sponsor promptly so that the sponsor is aware that such disclosure has occurred. Upon receipt, the sponsor shall provide copies of the information disclosed to FDA.</P>
              <P>(h) When some or all of the subjects in a study are children, an IRB must determine that the research study is in compliance with part 50, subpart D of this chapter, at the time of its initial review of the research.

Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the IRB chairperson from among the members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited review procedure set forth in § 56.108(c).</P>

              <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by these regulations the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies that subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>
              <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, handicapped, or mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
              <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with and to the extent required by part 50.</P>
              <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by § 50.27.</P>
              <P>(6) Where appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
              <P>(7) Where appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
              <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, handicapped, or mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>
              <P>(c) In order to approve research in which some or all of the subjects are children, an IRB must determine that all research is in compliance with part 50, subpart D of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) If apparent noncompliance with these regulations in the operation of an IRB is observed by an FDA investigator during an inspection, the inspector will present an oral or written summary of observations to an appropriate representative of the IRB. The Food and Drug Administration may subsequently send a letter describing the noncompliance to the IRB and to the parent institution.

              <P>(b) On the basis of the IRB's or the institution's response, FDA may schedule a reinspection to confirm the adequacy of corrective actions. In addition, until the IRB or the parent institution takes appropriate corrective action, the Agency may require the IRB to:</P>
              <P>(1) Withhold approval of new studies subject to the requirements of this part that are conducted at the institution or reviewed by the IRB;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(d) The parent institution is presumed to be responsible for the operation of an IRB, and the Food and Drug Administration will ordinarily direct any administrative action under this subpart against the institution. However, depending on the evidence of responsibility for deficiencies, determined during the investigation, the Food and Drug Administration may restrict its administrative actions to the IRB or to a component of the parent institution determined to be responsible for formal designation of the IRB.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The purposes of disqualification are:</P>
              <P>(1) To permit the exclusion from consideration of completed studies that were conducted by a testing facility which has failed to comply with the requirements of the good laboratory practice regulations until it can be adequately demonstrated that such noncompliance did not occur during, or did not affect the validity or acceptability of data generated by, a particular study; and</P>
              <P>(2) To exclude from consideration all studies completed after the date of disqualification until the facility can satisfy the Commissioner that it will conduct studies in compliance with such regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) The determination that a nonclinical laboratory study may not be considered in support of an application for a research or marketing permit does not, however, relieve the applicant for such a permit of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the results of the study to the Food and Drug Administration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Grounds for disqualification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Commissioner may disqualify a testing facility upon finding all of the following:</P>
              <P>(a) The testing facility failed to comply with one or more of the regulations set forth in this part (or any other regulations regarding such facilities in this chapter);</P>
              <P>(b) The noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the nonclinical laboratory studies; and</P>
              <P>(c) Other lesser regulatory actions (e.g., warnings or rejection of individual studies) have not been or will probably not be adequate to achieve compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 58.204</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Notice of and opportunity for hearing on proposed disqualification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Whenever the Commissioner has information indicating that grounds exist under § 58.202 which in his opinion justify disqualification of a testing facility, he may issue to the testing facility a written notice proposing that the facility be disqualified.</P>
              <P>(b) A hearing on the disqualification shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements for a regulatory hearing set forth in part 16 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Final order on disqualification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the Commissioner, after the regulatory hearing, or after the time for requesting a hearing expires without a request being made, upon an evaluation of the administrative record of the disqualification proceeding, makes the findings required in § 58.202, he shall issue a final order disqualifying the facility. Such order shall include a statement of the basis for that determination. Upon issuing a final order, the Commissioner shall notify (with a copy of the order) the testing facility of the action.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Commissioner, after a regulatory hearing or after the time for requesting a hearing expires without a request being made, upon an evaluation of the administrative record of the disqualification proceeding, does not make the findings required in § 58.202, he shall issue a final order terminating the disqualification proceeding. Such order shall include a statement of the basis for that determination. Upon issuing a final order the Commissioner <PRTPAGE P="403"/>shall notify the testing facility and provide a copy of the order.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 58.210</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Actions upon disqualification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Once a testing facility has been disqualified, each application for a research or marketing permit, whether approved or not, containing or relying upon any nonclinical laboratory study conducted by the disqualified testing facility may be examined to determine whether such study was or would be essential to a decision. If it is determined that a study was or would be essential, the Food and Drug Administration shall also determine whether the study is acceptable, notwithstanding the disqualification of the facility. Any study done by a testing facility before or after disqualification may be presumed to be unacceptable, and the person relying on the study may be required to establish that the study was not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification, e.g., by submitting validating information. If the study is then determined to be unacceptable, such data will be eliminated from consideration in support of the application; and such elimination may serve as new information justifying the termination or withdrawal of approval of the application.</P>
              <P>(b) No nonclinical laboratory study begun by a testing facility after the date of the facility's disqualification shall be considered in support of any application for a research or marketing permit, unless the facility has been reinstated under § 58.219. The determination that a study may not be considered in support of an application for a research or marketing permit does not, however, relieve the applicant for such a permit of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the results of the study to the Food and Drug Administration.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon issuance of a final order disqualifying a testing facility under § 58.206(a), the Commissioner may notify all or any interested persons. Such notice may be given at the discretion of the Commissioner whenever he believes that such disclosure would further the public interest or would promote compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations set forth in this part. Such notice, if given, shall include a copy of the final order issued under § 58.206(a) and shall state that the disqualification constitutes a determination by the Food and Drug Administration that nonclinical laboratory studies performed by the facility will not be considered by the Food and Drug Administration in support of any application for a research or marketing permit. If such notice is sent to another Federal Government agency, the Food and Drug Administration will recommend that the agency also consider whether or not it should accept nonclinical laboratory studies performed by the testing facility. If such notice is sent to any other person, it shall state that it is given because of the relationship between the testing facility and the person being notified and that the Food and Drug Administration is not advising or recommending that any action be taken by the person notified.</P>
              <P>(b) A determination that a testing facility has been disqualified and the administrative record regarding such determination are disclosable to the public under part 20 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Alternative or additional actions to disqualification.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Disqualification of a testing facility under this subpart is independent of, and neither in lieu of nor a precondition to, other proceedings or actions authorized by the act. The Food and Drug Administration may, at any time, institute against a testing facility and/or against the sponsor of a nonclinical laboratory study that has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration any appropriate judicial proceedings (civil or criminal) and any other appropriate regulatory action, in addition to or in lieu of, and prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to, disqualification. The Food and Drug Administration may also refer the matter to another Federal, State, or local government law enforcement or regulatory agency for such action as that agency deems appropriate.<PRTPAGE P="404"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration may refuse to consider any particular nonclinical laboratory study in support of an application for a research or marketing permit, if it finds that the study was not conducted in accordance with the good laboratory practice regulations set forth in this part, without disqualifying the testing facility that conducted the study or undertaking other regulatory action.</P>

              <P>Termination of a testing facility by a sponsor is independent of, and neither in lieu of nor a precondition to, proceedings or actions authorized by this subpart. If a sponsor terminates or suspends a testing facility from further participation in a nonclinical laboratory study that is being conducted as part of any application for a research or marketing permit that has been submitted to any Center of the Food and Drug Administration (whether approved or not), it shall notify that Center in writing within 15 working days of the action; the notice shall include a statement of the reasons for such action. Suspension or termination of a testing facility by a sponsor does not relieve it of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the results of the study to the Food and Drug Administration.</P>

              <P>A testing facility that has been disqualified may be reinstated as an acceptable source of nonclinical laboratory studies to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration if the Commissioner determines, upon an evaluation of the submission of the testing facility, that the facility can adequately assure that it will conduct future nonclinical laboratory studies in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations set forth in this part and, if any studies are currently being conducted, that the quality and integrity of such studies have not been seriously compromised. A disqualified testing facility that wishes to be so reinstated shall present in writing to the Commissioner reasons why it believes it should be reinstated and a detailed description of the corrective actions it has taken or intends to take to assure that the acts or omissions which led to its disqualification will not recur. The Commissioner may condition reinstatement upon the testing facility being found in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations upon an inspection. If a testing facility is reinstated, the Commissioner shall so notify the testing facility and all organizations and persons who were notified, under § 58.213 of the disqualification of the testing facility. A determination that a testing facility has been reinstated is disclosable to the public under part 20 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>In determining a product's regulatory review period, which consists of the sum of the lengths of a testing phase and an approval phase, FDA will review the information in each application using the following definitions of the testing phase and the approval phase for that class of products.</P>
              <P>(a) For human drugs:</P>
              <P>(1) The testing phase begins on the date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Act becomes effective (or the date an exemption under former section 507(d) of the Act became effective) for the approved human drug product and ends on the date a marketing application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act or section 505 of the act is initially submitted to FDA (or was initially submitted to FDA under former section 507 of the Act), and</P>

              <P>(2) The approval phase begins on the date a marketing application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act or section 505(b) of the Act is initially submitted to FDA (or was initially submitted under former section 507 of the Act) and ends on the date the application is approved.<PRTPAGE P="408"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) For food and color additives:</P>
              <P>(1) The testing phase begins on the date a major health or environmental effects test is begun and ends on the date a petition relying on the test and requesting the issuance of a regulation for use of the additive under section 409 or 721 of the Act is initially submitted to FDA.</P>
              <P>(2) The approval phase begins on the date a petition requesting the issuance of a regulation for use of the additive under section 409 or 721 of the Act is initially submitted to FDA and ends upon whichever of the following occurs last:</P>
              <P>(i) The regulation for the additive becomes effective; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Objections filed against the regulation that result in a stay of effectiveness are resolved and commercial marketing is permitted; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Proceedings resulting from objections to the regulation, after commercial marketing has been permitted and later stayed pending resolution of the proceedings, are finally resolved and commercial marketing is permitted.</P>
              <P>(c) For medical devices:</P>
              <P>(1) The testing phase begins on the date a clinical investigation on humans is begun and ends on the date an application for premarket approval of the device or a notice of completion of a product development protocol is initially submitted under section 515 of the Act. For purposes of this part, a clinical investigation is considered to begin on whichever of the following dates applies:</P>
              <P>(i) If an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act is required, the effective date of the exemption.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an IDE is not required, but institutional review board (IRB) approval under section 520(g)(3) of the Act is required, the IRB approval date.</P>
              <P>(iii) If neither an IDE nor IRB approval is required, the date on which the device is first used with human subjects as part of a clinical investigation to be filed with FDA to secure premarket approval of the device.</P>
              <P>(2) The approval phase either:</P>
              <P>(i) Begins on the date an application for premarket approval of the device is initially submitted under section 515 of the Act and ends on the date the application is approved; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Begins on the date a notice of completion of a product development protocol is initially submitted under section 515 of the Act and ends on the date the protocol is declared to be completed.</P>
              <P>(d) For animal drugs:</P>
              <P>(1) The testing phase begins on the date a major health or environmental effects test is begun or the date on which the agency acknowledges the filing of a notice of claimed investigational exemption for a new animal drug, whichever is earlier, and ends on the date a marketing application under section 512 of the Act is initially submitted to FDA.</P>
              <P>(2) The approval phase begins on the date a marketing application under section 512 of the Act is initially submitted to FDA and ends on the date the application is approved.</P>
              <P>(e) For purposes of this section, a “major health or environmental effects test” may be any test which:</P>
              <P>(1) Is reasonably related to the evaluation of the product's health or environmental effects, or both:</P>
              <P>(2) Produces data necessary for marketing approval; and</P>
              <P>(3) Is conducted over a period of no less than 6 months duration, excluding time required to analyze or evaluate test results.</P>

              <P>(f) For purposes of determining the regulatory review period for any product, a marketing application, a notice of completion of a product development protocol, or a petition is <E T="03">initially submitted</E> on the date it contains sufficient information to allow FDA to commence review of the application. A marketing application, a notice of completion of a product development protocol, or a petition is <E T="03">approved</E> on the date FDA sends the applicant a letter informing it of the approval or, by order declares a product development protocol to be completed, or, in the case of food and color additives, on the effective date of the final rule listing the additive for use as published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or, in the case of a new animal drug in a Category II Type A medicated article, on the date of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the notice of approval pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="409"/>section 512(i) of the Act.

              <P>(a) In determining the due diligence of an applicant, FDA will examine the facts and circumstances of the applicant's actions during the regulatory review period to determine whether the applicant exhibited that degree of attention, continuous directed effort, and timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and are ordinarily exercised by, a person during a regulatory review period. FDA will take into consideration all relevant factors, such as the amount of time between the approval of an investigational exemption or research permit and the commencement of a clinical investigation and the amount of time required to conduct a clinical investigation.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this part, the actions of the marketing applicant shall be imputed to the applicant for patent term restoration. The actions of an agent, attorney, contractor, employee, licensee, or predecessor in interest of the marketing applicant or applicant for patent term restoration shall be imputed to the applicant for patent term restoration.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Commissioner</E> means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Act</E> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Color Certification Branch</E> means the unit established within the Food and Drug Administration located in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, charged with the responsibility for the mechanics of the certification procedure hereinafter described, and including the examination of samples of color additives subject to certification.</P>
              <P>(f) A <E T="03">color additive</E> is any material, not exempted under section 201(t) of the act, that is a dye, pigment, or other substance made by a process of synthesis or similar artifice, or extracted, isolated, or otherwise derived, with or without intermediate or final change of identity, from a vegetable, animal, mineral, or other source and that, when added or applied to a food, drug, or cosmetic or to the human body or any part thereof, is capable (alone or through reaction with another substance) of imparting a color thereto. Substances capable of imparting a color to a container for foods, drugs, or cosmetics are not color additives unless the customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use of the container may reasonably be expected to result in the transmittal of the color to the contents of the package or any part thereof. Food ingredients such as cherries, green or red peppers, chocolate, and orange juice which contribute their own natural color when mixed with other foods are not regarded as <E T="03">color additives</E>; but where a food substance such as beet juice is deliberately used as a color, as in pink lemonade, it is a <E T="03">color additive.</E> Food ingredients as authorized by a definitions and standard of identity prescribed by regulations pursuant to section 401 of the act are <E T="03">color additives,</E> where the ingredients are specifically designated in the definitions and standards of identity as permitted for use for coloring purposes. An ingredient of an animal feed whose intended function is to impart, through the biological processes of the animal, a color to the meat, milk, or eggs of the animal is a color additive and is not exempt from the requirements of the statute. This definition shall apply whether or not such ingredient has nutritive or other functions in addition to the property of imparting color. An ingested drug the intended function of which is to impart color to the human body is a <E T="03">color additive.</E> For the purposes of this part, the term <E T="03">color</E> includes black, white, and intermediate grays, but substances including migrants from packaging materials which do not contribute any color apparent to the naked eye are not <E T="03">color additives.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(g) For a material otherwise meeting the definition of <E T="03">color additive</E> to be exempt from section 721 of the act, on the basis that it is used (or intended to be used) solely for a purpose or purposes other than coloring, the material must be used in a way that any color imparted is clearly unimportant insofar as the appearance, value, marketability, or consumer acceptability is concerned. (It is not enough to warrant exemption if conditions are such that the primary purpose of the material is other than to impart color.)</P>

              <P>(h) The exemption that applies to a pesticide chemical, soil or plant nutrient, or other agricultural chemical, where its coloring effect results solely <PRTPAGE P="413"/>from its aiding, retarding, or otherwise affecting directly or indirectly, the growth or other natural physiological processes of produce of the soil, applies only to color developed in such product through natural physiological processes such as enzymatic action. If the pesticide chemical, soil or plant nutrient, or other agricultural chemical itself acts as a color or carries as an ingredient a color, and because of this property colors the produce of the soil, it is a <E T="03">color additive</E> and is not exempt.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Safe</E> means that there is convincing evidence that establishes with reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of the color additive.</P>
              <P>(j) The term <E T="03">straight color</E> means a color additive listed in parts 73, 74, and 81 of this chapter, and includes lakes and such substances as are permitted by the specifications for such color.</P>
              <P>(k) The term <E T="03">mixture</E> means a color additive made by mixing two or more straight colors, or one or more straight colors and one or more diluents.</P>
              <P>(l) The term <E T="03">lake</E> means a straight color extended on a substratum by adsorption, coprecipitation, or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made by simple mixing process.</P>
              <P>(m) The term <E T="03">diluent</E> means any component of a color additive mixture that is not of itself a color additive and has been intentionally mixed therein to facilitate the use of the mixture in coloring foods, drugs, or cosmetics or in coloring the human body. The diluent may serve another functional purpose in the foods, drugs, or cosmetics, as for example sweetening, flavoring, emulsifying, or stabilizing, or may be a functional component of an article intended for coloring the human body.</P>
              <P>(n) The term <E T="03">substratum</E> means the substance on which the pure color in a lake is extended.</P>
              <P>(o) The term <E T="03">pure color</E> means the color contained in a color additive, exclusive of any intermediate or other component, or of any diluent or substratum contained therein.</P>
              <P>(p) The term <E T="03">batch</E> means a homogeneous lot of color additive or color additive mixture produced by an identified production operation, which is set apart and held as a unit for the purpose of obtaining certification of such quantity.</P>
              <P>(q) The term <E T="03">batch number</E> means the number assigned to a batch by the person who requests certification thereof.</P>
              <P>(r) The term <E T="03">lot number</E> means an identifying number or symbol assigned to a batch by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(s) The term <E T="03">area of the eye</E> means the area enclosed with in the circumference of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter of the infra-orbital ridge.</P>
              <P>(t) The term <E T="03">package</E> means the immediate container in which a color additive or color additive mixture has been packed for shipment or delivery. If the package is then packed in a shipping carton or other protective container, such container shall not be considered to be the immediate container. In the case of color additive mixtures for household use containing less than 15 percent pure color, when two or more containers of 3 ounces each or less, each containing a different color, are distributed as a unit, the immediate container for such unit shall be considered to be the package as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(u) The <E T="03">hair dye</E> exemption in section 601(a) of the act applies to coal tar hair dyes intended for use in altering the color of the hair and which are, or which bear or contain, color additives derived from coal tar with the sensitization potential of causing skin irritation in certain individuals and possible blindness when used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows. The exemption is permitted with the condition that the label of any such article bear conspicuously the statutory caution and adequate directions for preliminary patch-testing. The exemption does not apply to coloring ingredients in hair dyes not derived from coal tar, and it does not extend to poisonous or deleterious diluents that may be introduced as wetting agents, hair conditions, emulsifiers, or other components <PRTPAGE P="414"/>in a color shampoo, rinse, tint, or similar dual-purpose cosmetic that alter the color of the hair.</P>
              <P>(v) The terms <E T="03">externally applied drugs</E> and <E T="03">externally applied cosmetics</E> mean drugs or cosmetics applied only to external parts of the body and not to the lips or any body surface covered by mucous membrane.</P>

              <P>(3) A regulation will not be issued allowing the use of a color additive in a food for which a definition and standard of identity is established, unless its issuance is in conformance with section 401 of the act or with the terms of a temporary permit issued under § 130.17 of this chapter. When the contemplated use of such additive complies with the terms of a temporary permit, the color additive regulation will be conditioned on such compliance and will expire with the expiration of the temporary permit.</P>

              <P>(a) In deciding whether a petition is complete and suitable for filing and in reaching a decision on any petition filed, the Commissioner will apply the “safe-for-use” principle. This will require the presentation of all needed scientific data in support of a proposed listing to assure that each listed color additive will be safe for its intended use or uses in or on food, drugs, or cosmetics. The Commissioner may list a color additive for use generally in or on food, in or on drugs, or in or on cosmetics when he finds from the data presented that such additive is suitable and may safely be employed for such general use; he may list an additive only for more limited use or uses for which it is proven suitable and may safely be employed; and he is authorized to prescribe broadly the conditions under which the additive may be safely employed for such use or uses. This may allow the use of a particular dye, pigment, or other substance with certain diluents, but not with others, or at a higher concentration with some than with others.</P>

              <P>(b) The safety for external color additives will normally be determined by tests for acute oral toxicity, primary irritation, sensitization, subacute dermal toxicity on intact and abraded <PRTPAGE P="418"/>skin, and carcinogenicity by skin application. The Commissioner may waive any of such tests if data before him otherwise establish that such test is not required to determine safety for the use proposed.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon written request describing the proposed use of a color additive and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the Commissioner will advise a person who wishes to establish the safety of a color additive whether he believes the experiments planned will yield data adequate for an evaluation of the safety of the additive.</P>

              <P>Whenever, in the consideration of a petition or a proposal to list a color additive or to alter an existing listing, the data before the Commissioner fail to show that it would be safe to list the color additive for all the uses proposed or at the levels proposed, the Commissioner will notify the petitioner and other interested persons by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that it is necessary to allocate the safe tolerance for the straight color in the color additive among the competing needs. This notice shall call for the presentation of data by all interested persons on which the allocation can be made in accordance with section 721(b)(8) of the act. The time for acting upon the petition shall be stayed until such data are presented, whereupon the time limits shall begin to run anew. As promptly as possible after presentation of the data, the Commissioner will, by order, announce the allocation and the tolerance limitations.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Color additives that may be ingested.</E> Whenever (1) the scientific data before the Commissioner (either the reports from the scientific literature or the results of biological testing) suggest the possibility that the color additive including its components or impurities has induced cancer when ingested by man or animal; or (2) tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of additives in food suggest that the color additive, including its components or impurities, induces cancer in man or animal, the Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of appropriately qualified scientists, cancer has been induced and whether the color additive, including its components or impurities, was the causative substance. If it is his judgment that the data do not establish these facts, the cancer clause is not applicable; and if the data considered as a whole establish that the color additive will be safe under the conditions that can be specified in the applicable regulation, it may be listed for such use. But if in the judgment of the Commissioner, based on information from qualified scientists, cancer has been induced, no regulation may issue which permits its use.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Color additives that will not be ingested.</E> Whenever the scientific data before the Commissioner suggest the possibility that the color additive, including its components or impurities, has induced cancer in man or animals by routes other than ingestion, the Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of appropriately qualified scientists, the test suggesting the possibility of carcinogenesis is appropriate for the evaluation of the color additive for a use which does not involve ingestion, cancer has been induced, and the color additive, including its components or impurities, was the causative substance. If it is his judgment that the data do not establish these facts, the cancer clause is not applicable to preclude external drug and cosmetic uses, and if the data as a whole establish that the color additive will be safe under conditions that can be specified in the regulations, it may be listed for such use. But if, in the judgment of the Commissioner, based on information from qualified scientists, the test is an appropriate one for the consideration of safety for the proposed external use, and cancer has been induced by the color additive, including its components or impurities, no regulation may issue which permits its use in external drugs and cosmetics.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Color additives for use as an ingredient of feed for animals that are raised for food production.</E> Color additives that are an ingredient of the feed for animals raised for food production and that have the potential to contaminate <PRTPAGE P="419"/>human food with residues whose consumption could present a risk of cancer to people must satisfy the requirements of subpart E of part 500 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>Petitioner submits this pursuant to section 721(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requesting listing by the Commissioner of the color additive _____ as suitable and safe for use in or on _____ subject to the conditions that _______. [Petitioner may propose a listing for general use in food, drugs, or cosmetics or, if such general listing is not believed suitable and safe, the petitioner shall describe the conditions under which he believes the additive can be safely used and for which it will be suitable. These conditions may include tolerance limitations, specifications as to the manner in which the additive may be added or used, and directions and other labeling or packaging safeguards that should be applied. The level of use proposed should not be higher than reasonably required to accomplish the intended color effect.]</P>
                <P>Attached hereto, in triplicate (quadruplicate, if intended uses include uses in meat, meat food product, or poultry product), and constituting a part of this petition are the following:</P>
                <P>A. The name and all pertinent information concerning the color additive, including chemical identity and composition of the color additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and specifications prescribing its component(s) and identifying and limiting the reaction byproducts and other impurities.</P>
                <P>The petition shall contain a description of the chemical and physical tests relied upon to identify the color additive and shall contain a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the production of the color additive. These shall establish that it is a substance of reproducible composition. Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls, within reasonable limits, that do not affect the characteristics of the substance or the reliability of the controls may be specified.</P>
                <P>The petition shall supply a list of all substances used in the synthesis, extraction, or other method of preparation of any straight color, regardless of whether they undergo chemical change in the process. Each substance should be identified by its common or usual name and its complete chemical name, using structural formulas when necessary for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is used as a component, the proprietary name should be followed by a complete quantitive statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives for any listed substance may be specified.</P>
                <P>If the petitioner does not himself perform all the manufacturing, processing, and packing operations for a color additive, the petitioner shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations and designate the part.</P>
                <P>The petition shall include stability data, and, if the data indicate that it is needed to insure the identity, strength, quality, or purity of the color additive, the expiration period that will be employed as well as any packaging and labeling precautions needed to preserve stability.</P>
                <P>B. The amount of the color additive proposed for use and the color effect intended to be achieved, together with all directions, recommendations, and suggestions regarding the proposed use, as well as specimens of the labeling proposed for the color additive. If the color effect results or may reasonably be expected to result from use of the color additive in packaging material, the petitioner shall show how this may occur and what residues may reasonably be anticipated.</P>
                <P>Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy will be accepted for consideration of the petition provided final printed labeling identical in content to the draft copy is submitted as soon as available, and prior to the marketing of the color additive. The printed labeling shall conform in prominence and conspicuousness with the requirements of the act.</P>
                <P>If the color additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is required to assure its safety, the level of use proposed should be no higher than the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended physical or other technical effect, even though the safety data may support a higher tolerance. If the safety data will not support the use of the amount of the color additive reasonably needed to accomplish the desired color effect, the requested tolerance will not be established. Petitioners are expected to propose the use of color additives in accordance with sound color chemistry.</P>
                <P>C.1. A description of practicable methods to determine the pure color and all intermediates, subsidiary colors, and other components of the color additive.</P>

                <P>2. A description of practicable methods to determine the amount of the color additive in any raw, processed, and/or finished food, drug, or cosmetic in which use of the color additive is proposed. (The tests proposed shall be those that can be used for food, drug, <PRTPAGE P="421"/>or cosmetic control purposes and can be applied with consistent results by any properly equipped laboratory and trained personnel.)</P>
                <P>3. A description of methods for identification and determination of any substance formed in or on such food, drug, or cosmetic because of the use of the color additive. (If it is the petitioner's view that any such method would not be needed, under the terms of section 721(b)(5)(A)(iv), a statement shall be submitted in lieu of methods as to the basis for such view.)</P>
                <P>D. Full reports of investigation made with respect to the safety of the color additive.</P>
                <P>(A petition will be regarded as incomplete unless it includes full reports of adequate tests reasonably applicable to show whether or not the color additive will be safe for its intended use. The reports ordinarily should include detailed data derived from appropriate animal and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit without explanation any data that would influence the evaluation of the safety of the color additive).</P>
                <P>E. Complete data which will allow the Commissioner to consider, among other things, the probable consumption of, and/or other relevant exposure from the additive and of any substance formed in or on food, drugs, or cosmetics because of such additive; and the cumulative effect, if any, of such additive in the diet of man or animals, taking into account the same or any chemically or pharmacologically related substance or substances in the diet including, but not limited to food additives and pesticide chemicals for which tolerances or exemptions from tolerances have been established.</P>
                <P>F. Proposed tolerances and other limitations on the use of the color additive, if tolerances and limitations are required in order to insure its safety. A petitioner may include a proposed regulation.</P>

              <P>The Commissioner will forward for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> within 90 days after filing of the petition (or within 180 days if the time is extended as provided for in section 721(d)(1) of the act):</P>
              <P>(a) A regulation listing in part 73 or 74 of this chapter the color additive on the appropriate list or lists as provided under section 721(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(1) Such a regulation may list the color additive for use generally in or on foods, drugs, or cosmetics or for use in coloring the human body, as the case may be, or may prescribe the conditions under which the color additive may be safely used (including, but not limited to, specifications as to the particular food, drug, or cosmetic or classes of food, drugs, or cosmetics in or on which such color additive may be used, or for the material intended for coloring the human body; the maximum quantity of any straight color or diluent that may be used or permitted to remain in or on such food, drug, or cosmetic or article intended for coloring the human body; the manner in which such color additive may be added to or used in or on such food, drug, or cosmetic or for coloring the human body; and any directions or other labeling or packing requirements for such color additives deemed necessary to assure the safety of such use).</P>
              <P>(2) Such regulations shall list the color additive only for the use or uses for which it has been found suitable and for which it may safely be employed. Alternatively, the Commissioner shall by order deny the petition, and notify the petitioner of such order and the reasons therefor.</P>

              <P>(3) The regulation shall list any use or uses in meat, meat food product, or poultry product subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or the Poultry Products Inspection (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) for which the color additive has been <PRTPAGE P="425"/>found suitable and for which it may safely be employed.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever the Commissioner finds that batch certification is not necessary for the protection of the public health he will, by order, exempt the color additive from the certification procedure. In determining whether certification of a color additive is necessary, the Commissioner will consider the composition of the additive, its manufacturing process, possible impurities, its toxic potential, control and analytical procedures necessary to assure compliance with the listing specifications, and the variability of its composition.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitations of certificates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a certificate is obtained through fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, such certificate shall not be effective, and a color additive from the batch on which such certificate was issued shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part. Whenever, the Commissioner learns that any certificate has been obtained through fraud or material misrepresentation, he shall notify the holder of the certificate that it is of no effect.</P>
              <P>(b) If between the time a sample of color additive accompanying a request for certification is taken and the time a certificate covering the batch of such color additive is received by the person to whom it is issued, any such color additive becomes changed in composition, such certificates shall not be effective with respect to such changed color additive and such changed color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) If at any time after a certificate is received by the person to whom it is issued any color additive from the batch covered by such certificate becomes changed in composition, such certificate shall expire with respect to such changed color additive. After such expiration, such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with this part; except that such color additive shall not be so considered when used for coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic, or for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color additive was used as an ingredient, or for use in preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized, if such change resulted solely from such use.</P>
              <P>(d) A certificate shall expire with respect to any color additive covered thereby if the package in which such color additive was closed for shipment or delivery is opened. After such expiration such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified, except that such color additive shall not be so considered when the package is opened;</P>
              <P>(1) and such color additive is used, subject to the restrictions prescribed by paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, in coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic;</P>
              <P>(2) for the purpose of certifying a batch made by repacking such color;</P>
              <P>(3) for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color is used as an ingredient; or</P>
              <P>(4) for the purpose of preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized; or</P>
              <P>(5) when the package is reopened solely for repackaging by the person to whom such certificate was issued.</P>
              <P>(e) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such package is shipped or delivered under a label which does not bear all words, statements, and other information required by § 70.25 of this chapter to appear thereon.</P>
              <P>(f) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive, and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if:</P>
              <P>(1) Such package has not been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) Such package has been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter and the seal has been broken, intentionally or accidentally, unless such seal has been broken for the purpose of using color additive in accordance with § 80.38, or, such package has been opened by a duly authorized representative of the Administration or Department in the performance of his official <PRTPAGE P="523"/>duties, and he has immediately resealed the package in conformance with § 70.20 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(g) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such color additive is used in any manner other than that for which it was certified.</P>
              <P>(h) When the listing or the specifications for a color additive are revoked or amended, the final order effecting the revocation or amendment may specify, in addition to its own effective date, a date on which all certificates for existing batches and portions of batches of such a color additive theretofore issued under such revoked or amended regulations shall cease to be effective; and any such lots of the color additive shall be regarded as uncertified after the date specified unless a new certificate can be and is obtained in conformance with the new regulations. When a certificate thus ceases to be effective for a color additive, any certificates previously issued for a color additive mixture containing that color additive shall cease to be effective on the same date. Use of such color additive or color additive mixture after such specified date without the new certificate in preparing foods, drugs, or cosmetics will result in such food, drugs, or cosmetics being adulterated. When a certified color additive has been used in food, drugs, or cosmetics and the status of the color additive is thereafter changed by amendment or revocation of its listing or specification regulations, such food, drugs, and cosmetics will not be regarded as adulterated by reason of the use of such color additive, unless the hazard to health is such that existing stocks of the foods, drugs, or cosmetics cannot be safely used, in which cases findings to that effect will be made and regulations appropriate for such special cases will be issued.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Provisional lists of color additives.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that the following lists of color additives are provisionally listed under section 203(b) of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960 (sec. 203(b), 74 Stat. 405 (21 U.S.C. 379e note)). Except for color additives for which petitions <PRTPAGE P="525"/>have been filed, progress reports are required by January 1, 1968, and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Specifications for color additives listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section appear in the respective designated sections. The listing of color additives in this section is not to be construed as a listing for surgical suture use unless color additive petitions have been submitted for such use or the Commissioner has been notified of studies underway to establish the safety of the color additive for such use. The color additives listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may not be used in products which are intended to be used in the area of the eye. The color additives listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are provisionally listed until the closing dates set forth therein.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Ext. D&amp;C Yellow Nos. 9 and 10.</E> These colors cannot be produced with any assurance that they do not contain β-naphthylamine as an impurity. While it has been asserted that the two colors can be produced without the impurity named, no method of analysis has been suggested to establish the fact. β-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in products to be used in contact with the skin. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that such action is necessary to protect the public health, hereby terminated the provisional listing of Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 9 and Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 10.</P>
            <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">FD&amp;C Red No. 1.</E> Results of recent feeding tests of this color additive have demonstrated it to be toxic upon ingestion:</P>
            <P>(1) Groups of 50 rats are being fed diets containing FD&amp;C Red No. 1 at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0 percent. At this stage of the tests, which have now been in progress for from 15 months to 18 months, 116 animals from the 250 being fed FD&amp;C Red No. 1 at various levels and 27 of the 100 controls have died. Of these, 11 being fed at the 5 percent level, 16 being fed at the 2 percent level, 11 being fed at the 1 percent level, and 2 being fed at the 0.5 percent level, have shown liver damage. None of the controls that have died have shown liver damage.</P>
            <P>(2) Groups of 100 mice are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0.1 percent FD&amp;C Red No. 1, with 400 mice as controls. All mice on dosage levels of 2 percent and 1 percent died before the seventieth week. Gross liver damage has been observed in all groups fed at the 0.5 percent diet and above.</P>

            <P>(3) Groups of 4 dogs are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.25 percent, and 0 percent FD&amp;C Red No. 1. Three of the dogs on the 2 percent dosage level died before 32 weeks; the other is living. Three of the dogs on the 1 percent dosage level died or were <PRTPAGE P="526"/>sacrificed within 13 months. All deceased or sacrificed dogs have shown liver damage grossly and/or microscopically. Deceased dogs on the 1 percent and 2 percent dosage level showed poor physical condition.</P>
            <FP>The Commissioner of Food and Drugs having concluded that ingestion of this color additive over a long period of time would be unsafe, and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.</FP>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">FD&amp;C Red No. 4.</E> Feeding tests of this color additive have been conducted with three species:</P>
            <P>(1) Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and Sprague-Dawley strains were fed FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, and 0.5 percent of the diet. No effect was found.</P>
            <P>(2) Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL strains were fed FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. No effect was found.</P>
            <P>(3) Dogs were fed FD&amp;C Red No. 4 at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2-percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5<FR>1/2</FR> years on the test. Two of the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the 7 year study.</P>
            <FP>The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that available data do not permit the establishment of a safe level of use of this color additive in food, ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics. In order to protect the public health, the Commissioner hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for use in food and ingested drugs. The Commissioner has previously terminated the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 4 for use in ingested cosmetics. FD&amp;C Red No. 4 is listed for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics by §§ 74.1304 and 74.2304 of this chapter, respectively. Section 82.304 of this chapter is retained in part 82 of this chapter to permit the use of lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 4 in externally applied drugs and cosmetics.</FP>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">FD&amp;C Violet No. 1.</E> The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Violet No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">FD&amp;C Red No. 2.</E> The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD&amp;C Red No. 2 for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Carbon black</E> (<E T="03">prepared by the “impingement” or “channel” process</E>). The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of carbon black (prepared by the <E T="03">impingement</E> or <E T="03">channel</E> process) for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">D&amp;C Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13.</E> The petition for these color additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their continued provisional listing. In addition, the Commissioner has learned of the possible contamination of D&amp;C Red No. 10, D&amp;C Red No. 11, D&amp;C Red No. 12, and D&amp;C Red No. 13 with β-naphthyl-amine. The Commissioner concludes that these colors cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that they will not contain β-naphthylamine as an impurity or not yield β-naphthylamine from the metabolism of subsidiary colors present in them. β-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&amp;C Red No. 10, D&amp;C Red No. 11, D&amp;C Red No. 12, and D&amp;C Red No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 1.</E> The Commissioner has learned of the contamination of Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 1 with 4-aminobiphenyl. The Commissioner concludes that this color cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4-aminobiphenyl as an impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary reaction product that might be present in the color. 4-<PRTPAGE P="527"/>Aminobiphenyl and benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. In addition, insufficient data have been submitted to permit establishment of appropriate specifications for the batch certification of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D&amp;C Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Graphite.</E> Data have been developed that show the contamination of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA's). There is no reasonable assurance this color can be produced so that it will not contain PNA's as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA's in graphite would indicate that PNA's known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans may also be present. Therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of graphite for use in externally applied cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.</P>

Such information shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Be about a drug or device that has been approved, licensed, or cleared for marketing by FDA;</P>
              <P>(2) Be in the form of:</P>
              <P>(i) An unabridged reprint or copy of an article, peer-reviewed by experts qualified by scientific training or experience to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of the drug or device involved, which was published in a scientific or medical journal. In addition, the article must be about a clinical investigation with respect to the drug or device and must be considered to be scientifically sound by the experts described in this paragraph; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An unabridged reference publication that includes information about a clinical investigation with respect to the drug or device, which experts qualified by scientific training or experience to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of the drug or device that is the subject of the clinical investigation would consider to be scientifically sound;</P>
              <P>(3) Not pose a significant risk to the public health;</P>
              <P>(4) Not be false or misleading. FDA may consider information disseminated under this part to be false or misleading if, among other things, the information includes only favorable publications when unfavorable publications exist or excludes articles, reference publications, or other information required under § 99.103(a)(4) or the information presents conclusions that clearly cannot be supported by the results of the study; and</P>
              <P>(5) Not be derived from clinical research conducted by another manufacturer unless the manufacturer disseminating the information has the permission of such other manufacturer to make the dissemination.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this part:</P>
              <P>(1) FDA will find that all journal articles and reference publications (as those terms are defined in § 99.3) are scientifically sound except:</P>
              <P>(i) Letters to the editor;</P>
              <P>(ii) Abstracts of a publication;</P>
              <P>(iii) Those regarding Phase 1 trials in healthy people;</P>
              <P>(iv) Flagged reference publications that contain little or no substantive discussion of the relevant clinical investigation; and</P>
              <P>(v) Those regarding observations in four or fewer people that do not reflect any systematic attempt to collect data, unless the manufacturer demonstrates to FDA that such reports could help guide a physician in his/her medical practice.</P>
              <P>(2) A reprint or copy of an article or reference publication is “unabridged” only if it retains the same appearance, form, format, content, or configuration as the original article or publication. Such reprint, copy of an article, or reference publication shall not be disseminated with any information that is promotional in nature. A manufacturer may cite a particular discussion about a new use in a reference publication in the explanatory or other information attached to or otherwise accompanying the reference publication under § 99.103.</P>

              <P>(i) Objective and scientifically sound information pertaining to the safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device and which FDA determines is necessary to provide objectivity and balance. This may include information that the manufacturer has submitted to FDA or, where appropriate, a summary of such information and any other information that can be made publicly available; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An objective statement prepared by FDA, based on data or other scientifically sound information, bearing on the safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device.</P>

              <P>(b) The manufacturer's application for an exemption shall identify the basis for the proposed exemption and shall include materials demonstrating that it would be economically prohibitive or that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary to submit a supplemental application for the new use.</P>
              <P>(1) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be economically prohibitive to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall, at a minimum, provide:</P>
              <P>(i) Evidence explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the costs of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product. Such evidence shall include:</P>
              <P>(A) A description of the additional studies that the manufacturer believes are necessary to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, including documentation from prior discussions, if any, with the agency concerning the studies that would be needed, and an estimate of the projected costs for such studies;</P>
              <P>(B) The expected patient population for the new use;</P>
              <P>(C) The expected revenue for the new use, including an explanation of the price at which the drug or device will be sold;</P>
              <P>(D) Any exclusivity for the drug or device for the new use; and</P>
              <P>(E) Any other information that the manufacturer has showing that conducting the studies on the new use would be economically prohibitive; and</P>
              <P>(iii) An attestation by a responsible individual of the manufacturer or an individual acting on the manufacturer's behalf verifying that the estimates included with the submission are accurate and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures. The data underlying and supporting the estimates shall be made available to FDA upon request. Alternatively, a manufacturer may submit a report of an independent certified public accountant in accordance with the Statement of Standards for Attestation established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and agreed upon procedures performed with respect to the estimates submitted under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary for the supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall provide evidence:</P>
              <P>(i) Explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the new use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Explaining why it would be unethical to conduct the further studies that would be necessary for the approval of the new use. Such evidence shall establish that, notwithstanding <PRTPAGE P="544"/>the insufficiency of available data to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study (e.g., by providing no therapy, a placebo, an alternative therapy, or an alternative dose) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects. In assessing the appropriateness of conducting studies to support the new use, the manufacturer may provide evidence showing that the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy. The manufacturer shall also address the possibility of conducting studies in different populations or of modified design (e.g., adding the new therapy to existing treatments or using an alternative dose if monotherapy studies could not be conducted).</P>

FDA shall notify the manufacturer of its determination; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the manufacturer has completed studies that the manufacturer believes would be an adequate basis for the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, conduct a review of the protocols submitted for such studies to determine whether they are adequate. FDA shall notify the manufacturer of its determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Extension of time for completing planned studies.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Upon review of a drug or device manufacturer's proposed protocols and schedules for conducting studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use, FDA may, with or without a request for an extension from the manufacturer, determine that such studies cannot be completed and submitted within 36 months. The agency may exercise its discretion in extending the time period for completing the studies and submitting a supplemental application. Extensions under this paragraph are not subject to any time limit, but shall be made before the manufacturer begins the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for the new use.<PRTPAGE P="545"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer may, after beginning the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use, request in writing that FDA extend the time period for conducting studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use and submitting a supplemental application to FDA. FDA may grant or deny the request or, after consulting the manufacturer, grant an extension different from that requested by the manufacturer. FDA may grant a manufacturer's request for an extension if FDA determines that the manufacturer has acted with due diligence to conduct the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use and to submit such a supplemental application to FDA in a timely manner and that, despite such actions, the manufacturer needs additional time to complete the studies and submit the supplemental application. Extensions under this paragraph shall not exceed 24 months.</P>
              <P>(c) If FDA extends the time period for completing the studies and submitting a supplemental application under paragraph (a) of this section after the manufacturer has submitted a certification under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B), or if FDA grants a manufacturer's request for an extension under paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer shall submit a new certification under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B) that sets forth the timeframe within which clinical studies will be completed and a supplemental application will be submitted to FDA.</P>

              <P>(a) Within 60 days after receipt of an application for an exemption from the requirement of a supplemental application, FDA shall approve or deny the application.</P>
              <P>(1) If FDA does not act on the application for an exemption within the 60-day period, the application for an exemption shall be deemed to be approved.</P>
              <P>(2) If an application for an exemption is deemed to be approved, FDA may, at any time, terminate such approval if it determines that the requirements for granting an exemption have not been met. FDA shall notify the manufacturer if the approval is terminated.</P>
              <P>(b) In reviewing an application for an exemption, FDA shall consider the materials submitted by the manufacturer and may consider any other appropriate information, including, but not limited to, any pending or previously approved applications for exemption submitted by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) FDA may grant an application for an exemption if FDA determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) It would be economically prohibitive for the manufacturer to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, which at a minimum requires:</P>
              <P>(i) That existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the cost of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product, and there are not less expensive ways to obtain the needed information; or</P>
              <P>(2) It would be unethical to conduct clinical studies needed to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use because:</P>
              <P>(i) Existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Although available evidence would not support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects and no studies in different populations or of modified design can be utilized. In determining whether it would be unethical to conduct clinical studies, the agency shall consider, in addition to the persuasiveness of available evidence of effectiveness, whether <PRTPAGE P="546"/>the new use of the drug or device is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy.</P>

              <P>(b) A manufacturer disseminating information on a new use for a drug or device shall, on a semiannual basis, submit to the FDA office identified in § 99.201(c) of this part:</P>
              <P>(1) A list containing the titles of articles and reference publications relating to the new use of drugs or devices that the manufacturer disseminated to a health care practitioner, pharmacy benefit manager, health insurance issuer, group health plan, or Federal or State Government agency. The list shall cover articles and reference publications disseminated in the 6-month period preceding the date on which the manufacturer provides the list to FDA;</P>
              <P>(2) A list identifying the categories of health care practitioners, pharmacy benefit managers, health insurance issuers, group health plans, or Federal or State Government agencies that received the articles and reference publications in the 6-month period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
